  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge and Mrs. Breyer, welcome. We are delighted to have you
here. The first issue, when we get to questions, will be resolving
what State you are really from. But you are, indeed, privileged this
morning to have four of our distinguished colleagues anxious to be
associated with your nomination, and one in particular maybe is
considerably responsible for your nomination.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A U.S.
  SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE, CHAIRMAN,
  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
  Today the Senate Judiciary Committee welcomes Judge Stephen

Breyer, the President's nominee to be Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States.

  In each of the confirmation hearings that I have had the privi-
lege to chair, I have tried to look at the broader issues at stake
when we confirm a nominee to the Court--to consider the values
by which our Nation defines and redefines itself over time, and the
means by which Government can best express and defend those
values.

  At the start of the last decade, the Court seemed poised to recon-
sider many basic questions that most of us and most of the legal
community thought had already been well settled. In the late
1980's, for example, the Nation watched to see whether the Su-
preme Court would limit the set of personal rights that the Court
had previously deemed off limits to the Government and Govern-
ment intrusion, especially the right of the individual to make cer-
tain highly intimate decisions free from Court interference, or, as
Justice Brandeis had put it, the "right to be let alone."

                                                          (l)
  In considering the nomination of Judge Robert Bork, therefore,
I focused on the scope of personal rights not named--the so-called
unenumerated rights--in the Constitution. My blatantly stated fear
at that time was, if you will, a constitutional fear.

  More recently, we have seen new challenges mounted by the
most powerful economic interests in America by those who want to
reduce the ability of Government to protect the rights and interests
of the majority of Americans.

  Thus, in the hearings on Justice Clarence Thomas--and most
people forget that there really were two hearings. We had had a
hearing, and it had ended, on the substance before we had the sec-
ond, much more celebrated hearing. But in the hearing on Justice
Thomas's nomination, I was concerned at the same time the Court
would limit individual freedoms, it would tell Government that it
must pay a factory owner before it can keep him from dumping
chemical waste in a river running through his property and then
onto some adjacent farmland downstream.

  At the time, many people asked why I was concerned about this
arcane thing referred to as the takings clause, the takings clause
of the fifth amendment. As a matter of fact, many of the press writ-
ing today wrote interesting articles about how boring the discus-
sion was and why were we taking any interest in it, except for the
Wall Street Journal, which worried me that they got it right.

  That is supposed to be a joke. You are supposed to laugh a little
bit.

  There may be fewer questions now as to why I raised the issue
of the takings clause then, since in recent cases the Supreme Court
has used the takings clause to make it harder for Government to
regulate polluters or developers or other economic interests and ac-
tivities in the name of public welfare. In raising the level of protec-
tion afforded the rights of owners of businesses and beach-front va-
cation properties, the Court used language equating these property
rights with personal rights, such as the first amendment guarantee
of freedom of speech.

  So our recent confirmation hearings have focused primarily on
how the Court's direct interpretation of the Constitution shapes our
life. But the focus has now changed again in academia and among
legal scholars, and we are soon going to see a whole new set of
questions arise in the Supreme Court that I think have far-reach-
ing consequences based on how they will be resolved for the public
at large.

  The focus has now changed, and it must be remembered, it
seems to me, that the Court has, in fact, two major responsibilities.
The first responsibility is to interpret the Constitution, and the sec-
ond is to interpret statutes passed by the Congress and signed by
the President.

  While the first job is more familiar to most Americans, it is not
in any way more significant. Indeed, what has become quite clear
over the last decade is that it is increasingly through statutory in-
terpretation that the Court is shaping the nature and scope of basic
rights of all Americans.

  For example, one of the rights secured by the Constitution is the
14th amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws. The
Constitution empowers the Congress to enforce that guarantee of
equality through legislation. And, today, women, Americans with
disabilities, older Americans, and others enjoy equal opportunity to
work and to conduct their daily lives that are protected not by the
Constitution but by statute.

  In recent years, the Court has tended toward a grudging inter-
pretation of statutes passed by the Congress, signed by the Presi-
dent, and supported by the American people to ensure this greater
equality.

  Through various interpretive rules or, as we lawyers say, canons
of interpretation, the Court has raised the bar on Government by
adopting unduly restrictive, in my view, rules for interpreting stat-
utes or changing those statutory rules of interpretation midstream
and frustrating Congress' intent to ensure equality to women, the
disabled, and others. A classic case which I will discuss with you
later, Judge, is the Patterson case where the Court ruled that legis-
lation passed after the Civil War guaranteed that an employer
could not deny a person employment because they were black, but
concluded that if they were fired because they were black, the leg-
islation did not cover them for other reasons.

  The effect on that woman was the same. She was discriminated
against because a grudging interpretation of a statute was made,
not because of the failure to find a constitutional right in the Con-
stitution.

  I will discuss those cases at length with you, Judge, but I now
have a second concern and a related one, equally significant in my
view; that is, what values the Court will incorporate into its cal-
culus of interpreting statutes.

  In recent years, an influential group of scholars and judges,
known as the Law and Economics Movement, has proposed that
legal problems should be resolved from a purely economic perspec-
tive.

  Some proponents of this movement are relentless in their appli-
cation of this reasoning, analyzing every feature of our lives, in-
cluding marriage and sex, by reference to transactions costs, search
costs, and missed opportunities. Some have even said that we can
explain rape by talking about the cost to the rapist of finding a sex-
ual partner. This is a serious, serious undertaking on the part of
some very, very bright individuals.

  Presently, of course, we quite consciously prefer other values, in-
cluding social and moral norms, when we make policy and resolve
legal disputes. We choose to take into account the social values and
norms whether or not they make good, purely economic sense. We
do that every single day. We make those judgments on health care.
It does not make purely economic sense to spend a disproportionate
amount of our booty, our money, our taxes, on saving the lives of
people over the age of 80. But, as a matter of value, we value--
not from an economic standpoint--we, the American people,
through their Congress and their President, value the lives of the
elderly and conclude even though it does not make economic sense,
we have decided to do it. We choose to take into account social val-
ues and norms--again, whether or not they make good, purely eco-
nomic sense.

  Throughout your career, Judge, you have advocated the use of
economic analysis in prescribing solutions for many legal and policy
problems. As I read what you have written--and I think I have
read most of what you have written--your view is very distinguish-
able from the school of law and economics. But I will want to know
how you will use the economic model that you propose in judicial
decisionmaking.

  Judge Breyer, you have served ably as a judge and chief judge
on the First Circuit Court of Appeals for 14 years. As a professor
of law at Harvard and, to some of us here, more importantly, as
counsel to this committee, you are an established expert in regula-
tion and its reform, in administrative law and processes, and in the
intersection of science and law.

  I began by describing how the confirmation hearings of the past
8 years have engaged us in the constitutional debates of those
times. The reason that occurred, in part, was because the nominees
before us were active and influential participants in those debates.

  So it is again today, Judge. You have written and spoken at
length about the methods of statutory interpretation, and about the
role of economic analysis in resolving legal disputes. Thus, many
of the very issues that are now boiling today in the cauldrons of
debate among legal scholars and judges are those in which you are
considered the foremost expert.

  So we welcome you here today, Judge, not merely to measure
your competence to sit on the Court, but to engage us in a discus-
sion of those important matters.

  I would ask unanimous consent that the entirety of my state-
ment be entered in the record at this moment.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Biden follows:]

                                PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BIDEN

  Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee welcomes Judge Stephen Breyer, the
President's nominee to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  The Constitution vests authority in the United States Senate to give "advice and
consent" to the appointment of women and men nominated by the President to serve
as justices on the Supreme Court. "Advice and consent" has come to serve two pur-
poses: the first is for the Senate to learn more about the qualities of a President's
nominee and to determine whether to vote for confirmation; the second--a unique
function that has developed more fully over the last decade--is to provide the only
opportunity the Senate and the American people will have to discuss the great legal
issues of the day with the nominee, to get some indication of how he or she views
these issues.

  In each of the confirmation hearings I have chaired, I have tried to look at the
broader issues at stake when we confirm a nominee to the Court--to consider the
values by which a nation defines and re-defines itself over time--and the means by
which government can best express and defend those values.

  At the start of the last decade, the Court seemed poised to reconsider many basic
questions that most of us thought had already been well settled. In the late 1980's,
for example, the nation watched to see whether the Supreme Court would limit the
set of personal rights that the Court has previously deemed off-limits to government
intrusion--especially the right of the individual to make certain highly intimate de-
cisions free from government interference--the "right to be let alone"--which Justice
Brandeis characterized as "the most comprehensive of rights and the right most val-
ued by civilized man."

  In considering the nomination of Judge Robert Bork, therefore, I focused on the
scope of personal rights not named in the Constitution. My fear at that time was,
if you will, a "constitutional" fear: I was concerned that the Supreme Court might,
in the name of constitutional interpretation, constrict our right to make these highly
personal decisions without interference from the government.

  More recently, in the early 1990's, we have seen new challenges mounted by the
most powerful economic interests in America to reduce the ability of government to
protect the rights and interests of the vast majority of the American people. We had
not seen such a sustained attack on the ability of government to protect the average

{>awersso, nmsiinnicmeuemarlwyaigne  this century, when the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  child  labor
                                     laws and many others.
Thus, in the hearings on Justice Clarence Thomas's nomination, I was concerned
that the Court--again interpreting the Constitution--would, on the one hand, re-
strict an individual's ability to make highly personal decisions without interference
from the government, and at the same time make it harder for government to stop
a factory owner from dumping chemical waste in a river running through his prop-
erty and then onto farmland downstream--by requiring the government to pay the
factory owner not to pollute.

  At the time, many people asked why I was concerned about this arcane thing
called the "Takings Clause" of the Fifth Amendment. What is at stake here may
be harder to see, because the method of these challenges has been subtle, involving
highly technical legal rules, such as those which allocate burdens of proof. There
may be fewer questions now, since the Supreme Court has decided the Lucas case
and last month's Dolan case, in which the Court used the takings clause to make
it harder for governments to regulate polluters or developers or other economic in-
terests and activities in the name of the public welfare. In raising the level of pro-
tection afforded to the rights of owners of businesses and beachfront vacation prop-
erties, the Court used language equating the level of protection these property
rights with personal rights, such as the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of
speech.

  What's at stake in both these on-going debates are our individual freedoms. Our
recent confirmation hearings have focused primarily on the Court's direct interpre-
tation of the Constitution: what individual freedoms are guaranteed by the Con-
stitution, and when may government limit those freedoms? Can the government
interfere when an individual decides whom to marry? Whether to have children?
How to raise children? Does the Constitution afford as much protection to economic
rights as to personal rights? In other words, do we want to protect a developer's de-
sire to build a skyscraper in a residential neighborhood as fiercely as we protect a
black family's desire to buy a house in that neighborhood?

  These types of decision-making are tiie part of the Court's work most familiar to
us--but the Court has, in fact, two major responsibilities: to interpret the Constitu-
tion; and to interpret statutes passed by the Congress and signed by the President.
In the first kind of case, the Court's job is to decide whether certain action taken
by the Government complies with the Constitution--or in other words, is the action
constitutional? Here, the Constitution serves as the touchstone for evaluating the
Government's conduct. In the second kind of case, the Court's job is to decide wheth-
er and how a specific law applies to a specific case. Here, obviously, the statute it-
self, and not the Constitution, serves as the touchstone.

  What has become clear over the last decade is that the Court confronts basic
questions about individual rights, and about the tension between economic interests
and the public interest, not only when it interprets the Constitution, but also when
it interprets statutes. Indeed, this trend--where, by the method in which it inter-
prets statutes, the Court makes important decisions about how Americans can lead
their lives--has been demonstrated over and over again since the confirmation of
Justice Scalia. Quite frankly, I wish I had appreciated, at the time of his confirma-
tion hearings, how wedded Judge Scalia was to changing the way the Court inter-
prets statutes--because it is increasingly through statutory interpretation that the
Court is shaping the nature and scope of the basic rights of all Americans.

  Now we have new questions we must ask: What is the proper role of the courts
in interpreting the statues passed by the Congress and signed into law by the Presi-
dent--statutes that may directly affect basic individual rights? Should judges look
only at the precise language of a statute, or should they also consider its purpose
as reflected in what the drafters said and did in adopting it? If Congress enacts a
law that accurately reflects a value judgment by the American people but that
economists would deem economically unsound, should a court--may a court--use
economic standards when it interprets a law to review policy choices made by elect-
ed officials? Can what economists call "the greater good" be measured merely on a
mathematical scale, or should the courts respect the moral yardstick that Con-
gress--speaking for the American people--uses to measure the public interest? Must
courts recognize that the American people sometimes reach conclusions they fully
understand to fall short of purely economic good sense in order to pursue a desired
goal--for example, in spending large sums to make buildings accessible to the
handicapped?

  So what sound like mere technical questions affect, in fact, rights secured by the
Constitution. Consider the fourteenth amendment's guarantee of "equal protection
of the laws." In simplest terms, this means that the government may not discrimi-
nate against people because of their race, sex and other characteristics. The Con-
stitution empowers the Congress to enforce that guarantee of equality through legis-
lation. For example--the right of Americans with disabilities to enjoy equal opportu-
nities in employment, housing and other features of daily life; the right of women
to work in an atmosphere uncontaminated by sexual harassment; the right of Afri-
can-Americans to live in any neighborhood they choose; the right of older Americans
to continue to work as long as they can do their jobs; all these rights are protected
by federal statutes. If you are denied a job because you are a woman, I doubt very
much whether it will matter to you whether you have been denied the job by the
government, or by a private party. The Constitution protects you against the former
kind of discrimination, statutes against the latter.

  When a question arises about the meaning or scope of these statutes which have
the intention of insuring equality, it is often the Supreme Court that resolves the
dispute. If we want to know "how we're doing" with respect to equality, therefore,
we must look not only at how the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution--but
also at how it interprets the statutes that have equality as their aim. In deciding
how to apply a statute in a specific case, the Supreme Court has two basic choices:
the Court can either give the statute a generous reach to fulfill Congress's intent,
or it can give it a grudging one that requires Congress to be ever more precise.

  In recent years, it seems to me, the Court has too often chosen the second
course--it has too often been grudging. As a consequence, some of the "constitu-
tional" fears of the Bork and Thomas hearings have become, if you will, "statutory"
fears. But to the woman denied a job because she is a woman, it matters not one
bit whether the violation was constitutional or statutory--either way, she is still out
of work.

  In some cases the Court has been grudging by looking only at the literal language
of the statute before it, ignoring the statute's history and purposes. In 1989, for ex-
ample, in a case called Patterson y. McLean Credit Union, the Court was faced with
the question of whether a civil-rights statute passed several years after the Civil
War protected workers from racial harassment on the job. This statute guaranteed
to all persons within the United States "the same right * * * to make and enforce
contracts * * * as is enjoyed by white citizens." The Court agreed that this law pro-
hibited racial discrimination in hiring--but that it did not prohibit racial discrimi-
nation that occurs after a contract is made---that is, after a person is hired.

  This conclusion meant that this statute did not protect employees on the job from
being insulted because of their race, from being given demeaning work solely be-
cause of their race, or even from being fired because of their race, even though they
could not be discriminated against in a hiring decision. The Court bolstered its
hyper-literal interpretation of the statute by reference to a different law relating to
job discrimination, passed almost 100 years after the law at issue in Patterson was
passed-j-even though Congress had not said anything about changing the scope of
the earlier law when we passed the later statute. Though it was interpreting a stat-
ute in Patterson, not the Constitution, the Supreme Court directly shaped the mean-
ing that "equality" would have for a black woman named Brenda Patterson--and
what it would mean for the lives of all working Americans.

  In other cases, the Court's decisions have turned not so much on the language
of the statutes in question as on interpretive rules that the Court itself has created.
These interpretive rules are often called "canons" of statutory interpretation. In my
view, these interpretive rules have sometimes operated as a thumb on the scales
that tips the balance against a common-sense reading of legislation designed to pro-
tect individual women, individual blacks, and individual handicapped and older
Americans against invidious discrimination.

  Let me offer an example. Congress passed a law giving handicapped children the
right to equal educational opportunities. The law was aimed at states and local gov-
ernments, and it said specifically that a handicapped child could sue in a federal
court government that failed to meet its obligations under the statute. But in a case
called Dellmuth v. Muth, the Supreme Court refused to allow a handicapped child
to sue New York state in federal court. Congress had the power to grant a right
to sue a state, and the legislative history suggested that Congress had intended to
allow handicapped children to sue states in federal court. Nonetheless, according to
a majority of the Supreme Court, Congress had not used the correct words in grant-
ing the right of the family to sue the state. The Court used a "canon"--one that
disfavors suits against states in federal court--to reject the common-sense reading
of the statute's language, which would have permitted the suit.

  As Professors Eskridge and Frickey have pointed out, these sorts of canons oper-
ate as "super-strong clear statement rules," that permit the Court to engage in a
" Tjackdoor version of the constitutional activism mat most Justices on the current
Court have denounced." That is bad enough. But I have another problem with these
two cases. When you take together what the Court did in Dellmuth and in Patter-
son, it seems to me the Court was not only grudging, but inconsistent. In Patterson,
the Court said that the literal language of a statute counts for everything. In
Dellmuth, the Court said that even if the literal language of the statute covers the
case, it's not enough.

  That strikes me as flatly inconsistent. But one thing was consistent about the two
cases--their result. In one a black woman, in the second a handicapped child, were
denied their right to equal treatment. In both of these cases, the Congress was able
to undo the damage done by the Supreme Court by passing a new statute using dif-
ferent words. But the Court's decisions had the effect of delaying the equality in-
tended by the original legislation.

  These are just two of many recent cases in which the Court has narrowly inter-
preted laws protecting individual rights, but they illustrate how the Court, without
saying anything about the Constitution, can affect the scope of equality by interpret-
ing statutes. As we all well know, there will be many more such cases..To sum up
these cases, it would be like me asking the Supreme Court, "do you know what time
it is?" And the Court replying, simply, "yes." Now, you and I, Judge, and everyone
in this room realize that what I wanted to know when I asked that question was
the time of day. Instead, the Court answered my question formally, not as a request
for information but as a test of the Court's cognitive abilities. The Court's answer
was not untrue, but you might well call it a triumph of technical sophistry over
plain common sense. That might serve as a debating point, Judge, but it does not
serve the public interest.

  In the coming decade, the rights of individuals and the powers of government will
be affected as much by the Court's method of interpreting statutes as by its inter-
pretation of the Constitution--and we need a Court more interested in clarifying the
true intent of a law than in seeking quibbles that promote its own agenda.

  I have a second, related concern. As significant as its method of interpretation is
what values the Court will incorporate into the calculus of interpretation. In recent
years, an influential group of scholars and judges known as the "Law and Econom-
ics Movement" has offered a new view of how policy should be made and how legal
disputes should be resolved. In essence, this movement proposes that legal problems
should be resolved from a purely economic perspective, now that seeks economic effi-
ciency as its goal, so that the answer to a legal problem may be derived simply by
summing columns of numbers--costs, benefits, missed opportunities and the like.

  Some proponents of this movement are relentless in their application of this rea-
soning--analyzing every feature of our lives, including marriage and sex, by ref-
erence to transaction costs, search costs, and missed opportunities. Some have even
said that we can explain rape by talking about the cost to the rapist of finding a
sexual partner.

  Presently, of course, we quite consciously prefer other values--including social and
moral considerations--when we make policy and resolve legal disputes. We choose
to take into account social values, whether or not they make good, purely economic
sense.

  Throughout his career, Judge Breyer has advocated the use of economic analysis
in prescribing solutions for many legal and policy problems, and I will ask him how
he will use the economic model in judicial decision-making, particularly relating to
questions of public health and safety and to personal freedoms guaranteed to us
under our laws.

  Judge Breyer, you come before the committee with impeccable credentials and a
host of impressive accomplishments to your credit. You have been an able judge and
chief judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals for 14 years. During that time and
before, as a professor of law at Harvard and as chief counsel to this committee, you
have made an enviable name for yourself as an expert in regulation and its reform,
in administrative law and processes, and in the intersection of science and law.

  I began by describing how the confirmation hearings of the past eight years have
engaged us in the constitutional debates of those times, partly because those nomi-
nees were active and influential participants in those debates.

  So it is again today, Judge. You have written and spoken at length about methods
of statutory interpretation, and about the role of economic analysis in resolving legal
disputes. Thus, many of the very issues that are boiling today in the cauldrons of
debate among legal scholars and judges are those in which you are most expert. We
welcome you here to engage us in a discussion of these important matters.

  As we begin these hearings, I am concerned about the four areas I have identified
here today, all of which affect our personal liberty--the scope of our most important
individual freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution; the apparent emergence of eco-
nomic rights as standing shoulder to shoulder with--or shouldering aside--our per-
                                               8

sonal freedoms; the proper role for the Court in interpreting statutes enacted by the
Congress and signed by the President; and the utility of economic analysis in judi-
cial review of policy choices made by elected officials.

  These are not small questions, Judge; how we answer them will determine, di-
rectly and intimately, how Americans can live their personal lives and pursue their
personal goals. That is why this opportunity to discuss these questions is impor-
tant^-the result should be a Court better prepared to fulfill its constitutional re-
sponsibilities and a nation better enabled to pursue the destiny envisioned for it by
its founders.

  Judge Breyer, you are very welcome here.

  The CHAIRMAN. I will now yield to my distinguished colleague
from Utah, a man you know well, Senator Hatch.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S.
                SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH

  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I welcome you, Judge Breyer, and the distinguished Senators
who are here to testify with you. I appreciate your willingness to
go through this process.
  Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the nominee, Judge Stephen
Breyer, on his nomination to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. Judge Breyer has had a remarkably distinguished ca-
reer in the law and in public service. If confirmed, he will bring a
wealth of knowledge and expertise to the Court. And I might say
I believe that he will be confirmed.
  As an attorney in the Department of Justice, then as a professor
of law, Judge Breyer developed an expertise in administrative law
and antitrust, and an appreciation of the costs of excessive govern-
mental regulation. I first came to know and admire Judge Breyer
when he worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, first as a con-
sultant, then as chief counsel. In his work, Judge Breyer was in-
strumental in bringing about airline deregulation.
  For the past 14 years, Judge Breyer has distinguished himself on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Known for his care-
ful, scholarly opinions on a range of difficult issues, he has defied
simplistic categorization. While a judge, he also served on the U.S.
Sentencing Commission and helped to draft the Federal sentencing
guidelines. That was no small achievement.
  That Judge Breyer has the intellect, character, and temperament
to serve on the Supreme Court is not, in my mind, in question. An
additional essential qualification for any Supreme Court nominee
is that he or she understand and be committed to respect the role
of the Supreme Court in our governmental system of separated
powers and federalism. This qualification has become all the more
important in recent decades, when so many voices from academia,
the media, and special interest groups have been attempting to jus-
tify the view that the Supreme Court is entitled to operate as a
super legislature. Under this view, Justices enshrine their own pol-
icy preferences in place of the laws passed by Congress and the
State legislatures.
  Under our system, a Supreme Court Justice should interpret the
law and not legislate his or her own policy preferences from the
bench. The role of the judicial branch is to enforce the provisions
of the Constitution and the other Federal laws according to their
understood meaning when they were enacted.
  Any other philosophy of judging enables unelected judges with
lifetime tenure to impose their own personal views or sentiments
on the American people in the guise of construing the Constitution
and Federal statutes. There is no other way around this conclusion.
Such an approach is called judicial activism, plain and simple. And
it is wrong, whether it comes from the political left or whether it
comes from the political right.

  Let there be no mistake: The Constitution, in its original mean-
ing, can be applied to changing circumstances. The fact that tele-
phones did not exist in 1791, for example, does not mean that the
fourth amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures is
inapplicable to a person's use of the telephone. But while cir-
cumstances may change, the meaning of the text, which applies to
those new circumstances, does not change.

  We often hear about the supposed needed for a living Constitu-
tion. Those who use this phrase typically mean that the Constitu-
tion should be reconstrued to give constitutional status to whatever
interests they currently regard as important. But the Constitution
remains living and well suited to a changing society not because its
provisions can be twisted to mean whatever activist judges want
them to mean. It remains living because it disperses and limits
Government power and, equally importantly, because within those
limits it leaves to the State legislatures and Congress primary au-
thority to adapt laws to changing circumstances. After all, the very
point of a democratic republic, its core virtue, is that the people
generally decide how society will pursue its various goals and com-
bat its various problems.

  This does not mean that those liberties not specially guaranteed
by the Constitution have no protection. The Constitution's real ge-
nius--what Madison recognized as its greatest protection of our lib-
erties--lies in its dispersion of Government power among the three
Federal branches and between the Federal Government and the
States. It is these structural features of separation of powers and
federalism that provide our most important guarantee against op-
pressive legislation.

  In an earlier era, judicial activism resulted in the invalidation of
State social welfare legislation, such as wage and hour laws. Since
the advent of the Warren Court, judicial activism has, to cite a few
examples, handcuffed the police in the battle against crime; inter-
fered with the ability of communities to protect themselves from
the scourges of obscenity, drug dealing, and prostitution; twisted
constitutional and statutory guarantees of equal protection into ve-
hicles for reverse discrimination and quotas; chased religious ex-
pression out of the public square; and imposed a regime of abortion
on demand that is the most extreme in the Western World. The
death penalty, which is, of course, expressly contemplated by the
Constitution, is currently under attack by advocates of judicial ac-
tivism.

  Many voices will urge Judge Breyer to become a judicial activist.
Indeed, one judicial activist, in a remarkable display of effrontery,
has already written a newspaper op-ed appealing to Judge Breyer
to grow. Funny, isn't it, how moving to the left is seen as growing?
Judge Breyer can rest assured that his stature will grow by his
                                       10

continuing to do what has brought him to this special point:
crafting judicial opinions that support the rule of law.

  While I do not agree with all of his opinions, I take considerable
comfort from Judge Breyer's overall record that he will resist the
siren calls of judicial activism. Judge Breyer has not displayed his
sentiments on the sleeve of his judicial robe, nor has he pursued
an ideological or political agenda. He has not strained to invent
hypertechnical rules that benefit criminals at the expense of hon-
est, law-abiding citizens. Instead, he has called into question what
he has termed the right creation problem--that is, the misguided
view that society's problems can best be resolved by recasting com-
peting interests as rights or entitlements.

  There are, undoubtedly, areas where Judge Breyer and I will dis-
agree in our reading of the law. I do not expect to agree with any
nominee, especially one chosen by a President of the other party,
on every issue that will come before the judicial branch. But it has
been my consistent belief that a President--and this President--is
entitled to significant deference in selecting a Supreme Court Jus-
tice, and in this case he has made an excellent selection.

  President Clinton and I are unlikely ever to agree on the person
who ought to be nominated. But so long as a nominee is experi-
enced in the law, is intelligent, has good character and tempera-
ment, and gives clear and convincing evidence of understanding the
proper role of the judiciary in our system of Government, I can sup-
port that nominee. In this case, I have a great deal of regard and
affection and experience and understanding of Judge Breyer, and
I think a great deal of him, and I intend to support him. It is my
hope and my firm expectation that this hearing will satisfy this
committee that Judge Breyer meets the test of understanding the
role of the judiciary in the constitutional processes of this Govern-
ment.

  Judge Breyer, we welcome you here. We compliment you for
being selected. We have high expectations of your service on the
Court, and I hope you will enjoy these proceedings.

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing is adjourned. [Laughter.]
  Judge, I said earlier that one of the most difficult questions faced
today is from what State you hail, and I have decided how to re-
solve that: to disregard the States and go by a time-honored tradi-
tion of the Senate, seniority.
  Senator Kennedy.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S.
          SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, members of
the committee, it is a great honor to introduce Judge Stephen
Breyer, President Clinton's nominee to be Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  We all know the fundamental role of the Supreme Court in our
society. Our Nation celebrated its 218th birthday last week, proud
of the fact that more Americans than ever can enjoy the fundamen-
tal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness pledged in
the Declaration of Independence.

  The Constitution is designed to guarantee those rights, and it is
the nine Justices of the Supreme Court who have the last word on
                                       11

the meaning of that charter of our liberties. Their decisions affect
the lives of all Americans today, and for years to come.

  Judge Stephen Breyer is superbly qualified to serve on our high-
est Court. Throughout his long and brilliant career, Judge Breyer
has committed himself to public service, to excellence in the law,
and to the pursuit of justice for all Americans.

  After graduating with honors from Stanford University, he at-
tended Oxford as a Marshall scholar. At Harvard Law School, he
was an editor of the Law Review. He served as a law clerk for Su-
preme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, a renowned defender of civil
liberties and one of Judge Breyer's proudest mentors and admirers
in later years.

  Judge Breyer next served in the Antitrust Division of the Depart-
ment of Justice where he sought to enforce the antitrust laws to
protect consumers from practices that drive up prices, hurt com-
petition, or involve discrimination. In one important case, he devel-
oped the successful argument that the antitrust laws bar real es-
tate agents from agreeing not to show homes in white neighbor-
hoods to black families.

  Judge Breyer then returned to Harvard Law School as a member
of the faculty, where he earned an outstanding reputation for his
scholarship in the areas of antitrust law and administrative law,
focusing on the profoundly important work of improving our free
enterprise system and our system of government.

  In 1973, he took a leave of absence at the request of Watergate
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox to help in that historic investiga-
tion.

  In 1974, he became special counsel to the Administrative Prac-
tice and Procedure Subcommittee of this committee. I was chair-
man of the subcommittee at the time, and I have known Judge
Breyer well ever since. His competence and creativity, his leader-
ship ability and skill at working productively with Senators, inter-
est groups, and constituents of widely different views were evident
from the start.

  He was indispensable to our bipartisan effort in those years to
deregulate the airline industry and the trucking industry. Judge
Breyer dedicated himself to assuring that all Americans would
have safe and efficient air travel at the lowest possible prices for
the public, and that shippers and consumers alike would reap the
benefits of lower prices in the trucking industry. Those two laws
were among the most important achievements of Congress in that
decade. I might add that we would have much more competition in
the health care industry today if we had given Judge Breyer that
assignment, too.

  I asked Judge Breyer to serve as chief counsel of this committee
when I became chairman in 1979. His intelligence, fairness, and
his commitment to unifying common ground instead of polarizing
narrow ground earned him the admiration and respect and often
the affection of every member of this committee, Democrats and
Republicans. Those qualities were evident in December 1980 when
Judge Breyer was the only judicial nominee confirmed by the Sen-
ate after President Reagan's election.

  Since then, as a member of the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit, Judge Breyer has earned a reputation as a brilliant and
                                       12

fair-minded jurist. As chief judge of that court, he is well known
and respected for his efforts to develop consensus and minimize
dissent. His opinions are models of clarity, written, as the judge
has said, so that the real people who are the parties in the cases,
not just the lawyers, can understand the court rulings, too.

  In his decisions, he has construed the Constitution to defend the
basic rights of all Americans.

  He has protected the right of women seeking family planning ad-
vice to hear about their right to choose to terminate a pregnancy.

  He has protected the right of Government employees to engage
in political activity and advocacy.

  He has protected the right of students belonging to a church
group to be recognized by a State university.

  He has protected the right of every citizen to rent or buy hous-
ing, free from the threat of discrimination.

  His opinions on environmental laws have been praised by envi-
ronmentalists.

  His opinions in criminal law cases seek to assure public safety
while protecting the constitutional rights of defendants.

  As one of the first members of the Sentencing Commission, he is
widely credited with developing the guidelines to reduce the dis-
parities in sentences given to defendants committing similar
crimes.

  As a judge, he has also continued his dedication to teaching and
legal scholarship. In addition to his administrative and judicial du-
ties, he has continued to teach courses at Harvard Law School, and
he has also continued to write and publish articles and books ana-
lyzing important issues of law and Government.

  Judge Breyer ranks among the country's most thoughtful schol-
ars of the regulatory process, and his knowledge and experience in
this complex area of the law will be a major asset to all the mem-
bers of the Supreme Court from the day he takes his seat.

  His most recent book on regulation drew praise from leading ex-
perts on all sides of the debate. He has sought to assure that the
public health and safety are protected, while avoiding needless in-
efficiency and waste in government. Not everyone agrees with all
of his views, but I suspect that everyone will agree that his views
have contributed immensely to our understanding of these complex
issues in our modern society.

  In addition, perhaps because of his service to the Senate, Judge
Breyer has emerged as one of the leading exponents of the view
that laws should be construed in the manner that Congress in-
tended. If confirmed, he will add a needed and well-informed per-
spective to the many important questions of statutory interpreta-
tion that come before the Supreme Court.

  Finally, I want to mention Judge Breyer's extraordinary family.
His wife Joanna is widely respected in Massachusetts as a psychol-
ogist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, where she counsels chil-
dren with terminal cancer and their families.

  Steve and Joanna's older daughter, Chloe, recently graduated
from Harvard and now edits the magazine Who Cares?, which pro-
motes public service by young adults. Obviously, the apple did not
fall far from the tree.
                                       13

  Their younger daughter Nell recently graduated from Yale, and
their son Michael has just completed his freshman year at Stan-
ford.

  In an address about the legal profession, another outstanding
Massachusetts jurist, Oliver Wendell Holmes, wrote that "every
calling is great when greatly pursued." Throughout his career,
Judge Breyer has shown that the pursuit of justice can be a great
calling, and I am confident that he will be a great Justice on the
Supreme Court.

  I commend President Clinton for this excellent nomination, and
I look forward to these hearings.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Kennedy.
  Senator Kerry.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
                   THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

  Senator KERRY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is my
privilege to join with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, and with the
Senators from California in formally introducing Judge Breyer both
to the committee and to the proceedings.

  You and members of the committee know him personally and
very well, and now with these hearings, the country will get to
know him, too. I am confident that our fellow citizens will very
quickly appreciate and respect the qualities which were at the cen-
ter of the President's decision to nominate Stephen Breyer.

  As this committee knows better than any entity in the country,
the confirmation of a Justice of the Supreme Court is always im-
portant. It is serious business. It is the exercise of one of the Sen-
ate's most important responsibilities, with enormous transfer of
power to one individual for a lifetime. So, as always, I know the
committee will ask a broad set of tough questions, as Senator
Hatch has said.

  I also know that Judge Breyer will reconfirm the belief in those
of you who hold it and convince those of you who do not, as well
as convince the country, that he brings great legal skills and per-
sonal commitment to this task and a great potential to move and
to help shape the Court itself.

  He brings special qualities to this job, if I can add to those things
that Senator Kennedy has talked about of his record. He has
worked for all three branches of Government. He has taught. He
has published, and he has handed down, as Senator Kennedy said,
major opinions in multiple areas of the law.

  He has shown himself to be an individual of extraordinary range.
He is trilingual. He serves on a Federal judicial study committee
that contemplates the relationship between law and the science. He
reads Proust in the original French, and he has even studied archi-
tecture to help make judgments about Federal construction.

  But mostly, Mr. Chairman, those who know him well have come
to know that Judge Breyer is a person who remembers on a daily
basis what it means to serve the people and to serve the Constitu-
tion, and he has worked hard to stay close to the reality of life in
America. You will be pleased to know that that grounding in re-
ality was even demonstrated in a statement about his alma mater,
Harvard, when he said that life there is important but it does not
                                       14
affect 99 percent of the people who get up, go to work, have to edu-
cate their children, and get their health insurance. And he defines
his role on the Court to be "to make the average person's life bet-
ter."

  He has said that while the task ahead of him is an incredible
challenge, he is deeply humbled in simply thinking about it.

  I think it is that attitude which indicates the ways in which he
has tried to stay close to the people that his decisions have an im-
pact on. A small example of that is seen in the fact that because
the court that he currently sits on has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico
and because he felt that understanding a culture is deepened by an
appreciation of language, he taught himself Spanish. In fact, he
convinced all the judges of the first circuit to take Spanish lessons
along with him.

  Much of the substantive work that he has performed he already
had dramatic impact on the lives of Americans. Ted Kennedy has
already described much of that, and I will not repeat it except to
say that his almost singlehanded deregulation, with respect to the
committee, of the airline industry led to enormous change, reduc-
tions in fares, and the clear benefit to consumers in the country.

  The committee will remember also that as chief counsel he
helped to improve fair housing legislation by drafting a law to cre-
ate an administrative mechanism for the enforcement of fair hous-
ing laws.

  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee,
throughout his career Judge Breyer has shown in his performance
of judicial duty a commitment to principle and skill in resolving
moral paradoxes. He opposed the removal from tenure of a profes-
sor who stated that the Holocaust was a hoax because he believed
that it is more valuable to preserve the principle of tenure than to
punish one disturbed individual.

  When dealing with the tremendous conflicts inherent in revising
the Federal sentencing guidelines, he chose what was deemed to be
a brilliant, innovative, and fair route, arguing that in the absence
of any one clear moral path, one should at least codify and clarify
the status quo.

  He summed up his view of the law once by saying, "There is a
whole mass of legal material that is supposed to fit together. What
it is supposed to do is allow all people"--and this he emphasizes,
"all people"--"even though they have some many different views, to
live and work productively together."

  I believe the committee knows already but will see confirmed in
the next days ahead that Steve Breyer is a person of character,
which is, after all, a central issue in any nomination. From his
youth as an Eagle Scout, to digging ditches for Pacific Gas & Elec-
tric in high school, to working as a janitor for San Francisco's
school system, he has shared in the American experience and he
has been affected by it.

  Mr. Chairman, Steve Breyer comes to you a nominee with great
judicial and personal skills. He has an open, inquiring mind. He
can and will think in nonlinear, creative ways, but he is also prin-
cipled and committed and passionate. He has learned how to serve
as mediator and consensus builder, but he also knows how to press
the case as an artful advocate.
                                       15

  It is interesting to note that the first circuit has been admired
for its amazing scarcity of dissents, due in no small part to Judge
Breyer's ability to encourage people to empathize with each other
and to teach people with disparate views to find new ways to agree.
I am confident that it is this ability that has gained him the back-
ing of liberals and conservatives alike, not because he is a centrist
or a moderate, which may prove to be inaccurate, but because he
has an enormous intellectual honesty and because he is fair.

  Colleagues, litigants, students, and clerks uniformly agree that
Judge Breyer never wraps his ego into an issue, he never elevates
politics over principle, and he has earned his reputation as a
skilled jurist by being openminded and sensitive to detail. So I am
confident, Mr. Chairman, that the committee will overwhelmingly
agree, and I could not more strongly recommend Judge Stephen
Breyer for your confirmation.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Now we will hear from a distinguished member of this commit-
tee, Senator Feinstein.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S.
              SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. As one of the newer members on this
committee, it, indeed, has been a great, I think, and unique experi-
ence to sit on my first confirmation to be an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and now to go through
these hearings for Judge Stephen Breyer.

  The CHAIRMAN. We credit you with the new-found stability on
these issues.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, sir. And I must say I think both
Senators from Massachusetts have well and articulately spelled out
the kind of scholarship, the legal history, the common sense, the
maturity, and the judgment that Stephen Breyer can bring to the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  For me, being a nonlawyer on this committee, the test is a little
different. For me, the test is how an individual jurist can really
apply what is happening on the streets of America to the Constitu-
tion of the United States and make that document work for the
well-being of all of the people, not just this group or that group,
because America is, indeed, a very troubled land.

  I am very proud to say that Stephen Breyer hails from the great
State of California. More specifically, I am proud to say that he
hails from my home city, attended school at Lowell High School at
about the same time as my husband. I am also proud to say that
his father, Irving Breyer, was general counsel for the San Francisco
Unified School District. And as mayor of San Francisco, I came to
count on his good sense and judgment in many serious problems
affecting the Unified School District of San Francisco.

  Judge Breyer brings to the east coast really, in a sense, the best
of the west coast: the best of public and private education from
Lowell High School to Stanford University; the best of the streets,
as Senator Kerry mentioned, whether as a ditch digger for Pacific
Gas & Electric or as a waiter for the San Francisco Parks and
                                       16

Recreation Department; or as a member of the Armed Forces sta-
tioned at Fort Ord, CA.

  His community service is known to all of us. His legal service is
also known as well. I have tried to read all of the many articles
that I have seen in print about Stephen Breyer, and what I see is
a man deeply dedicated to the pursuit of the law, a man prepared
to struggle to do what is right by the Constitution, but a man that
also understands what is important to the people and streets of
this Nation.

  I believe that something that he said when he was introduced by
the President deserves repeating here,

  The Constitution and the law must be more than mere words, they must work
as a practical reality. And I will certainly try to make the law work for people, be-
cause that is its defining purpose in a government of the people.

  In a sense, I believe that says all there is to say, well and with
heartfelt sense, about Stephen Breyer. So it is with a great deal of
personal pride and pleasure, as a Senator and a Californian, that
I am able to join with my respected colleagues in presenting to you
the very distinguished nomination of Stephen Breyer to become As-
sociate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein.
  Now, last but not least, a Senator who has for some time taken
a keen interest in the activities of this committee, whether or not
she was on the House side or as a Senator on this side of the aisle,
on this side of the Capitol, I should say, welcome, Senator Boxer.

STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
                             THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

  Senator BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Sen-
ator Hatch.

  This is such an honor for us, and today, Massachusetts and Cali-
fornia share the honor of introducing a very, very famous Amer-
ican, and I would say we are very proud, and I think all America
will be proud, as these hearings proceed on you, Judge Breyer.

  Certainly, you know that we are delighted to say that in those
early formative years, Stephen Breyer was born and raised in San
Francisco, his family put a high value on education, public service,
and the important combination of the two.

  I do not know whether you know, Mr. Chairman, that Judge
Breyer's grandfather Samuel served with distinction on the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, where my colleague Dianne Fein-
stein served, and I served across the Golden Gate Bridge on the
Board of Supervisors of Marin.

  His mother Ann was active in the League of Women Voters and
in local Democratic politics. And for more than 40 years, as you
heard, his father Irving Breyer was legal counsel to the San Fran-
cisco Board of Education.

  So, from the very beginning, Stephen Breyer seemed destined to
carry on his family's tradition of scholarship and public service. His
senior class at San Francisco's Lowell High School named him most
likely to succeed. They were right. And his aunt Shirley Black ex-
plained, "He started speaking in sentences, we knew he would be
something great," spoken by an aunt. But she was right, too.
                                       17

  Stephen Breyer comes to us today with a remarkable diversity of
experiences and skills. I will not go into all of those. They have
been so carefully explained by my colleagues. But perhaps what
you do not know is that Stephen Breyer is not only a husband and
father of three, he is a gourmet cook, he is a bird watcher and avid
reader, a student of philosophy and a speed typist. I really respect
that, because my mother taught me, when I was a kid growing up
in the fifties, you had to learn to type, and I only thought that they
said that to girls. He rides his bicycle to work and, as we know,
he has taught himself Spanish. This is a well-rounded individual.

  I think it is important to listen to what those who know Stephen
Breyer best have said about him. Stu Pollack, a municipal judge
in San Francisco, said, "Ours was the age of Kennedy. Government
was there as a tool to bring about change. I don't think Steve ever
had his faith in public institutions shaken." He further explained,
"Steve's father spent his professional career as an attorney for the
board of education. I think Steve absorbed the ethic that things of
value lay in work that had some sort of public impact."

  Richard Cudahy, a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, said, "Everyone knows he's an intelligent guy, but he also
understands the human side of the law and, most important, he
has got a great sense of humor."

  Judge Bruce Selya, an appeals court colleague, said, "The most
unusual thing about him is that he makes everyone feel at ease,
despite his absolutely stunning intellect."

  The San Francisco Chronicle praises this nomination, and they
do not praise a lot of things. [Laughter.]

  Once again, I want to say congratulations to Judge Breyer on his
nomination, and to thank the Chair and the ranking Senator on
the committee for allowing us to share this honor of introducing
him to you this morning.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  I would like the record to show that when the phrase "great
sense of humor" and the phrase "well-rounded" were used, that all
of his children laughed hysterically, which shows that they are a
typical American family. [Laughter.]
  I think the people we really should hear from, to know about Ste-
phen Breyer, is not his wife, not his brother--by the way, sir, you
could be his publicist. I watched you on television. You are incred-
ible. If you ever decide to leave the practice of law, there is a future
for you, if you could ever say the things about others you say about
your brother. I will tell you what, this guy is good, Judge. You
should keep him around and keep him close.
  But the people we really should hear from are your children. So
we are going to do something very unusual and swear in your chil-
dren now and find out what the real story is here. [Laughter.]
  Judge speaking of swearing in, this is the moment. As you well
know, I would like you to stand to be sworn.
  Judge do you swear that the testimony that you are about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I do.

TESTIMONY OF HON. STEPHEN G. BREYER, OF MASSACHU-
   SETTS, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  The CHAIRMAN. With that, I would like to invite my colleagues
who are members of the committee to come and take their seats,
and I thank our colleagues from Massachusetts and California who
are not members of the committee.

  Judge while our colleagues are assuming their seats, would you
be kind enough to introduce your remarkable family, and they are
remarkable, to us and to the Nation.

  Judge BREYER. I would like to introduce, Senator, my wife Jo-
anna, who, as Senator Kennedy said, worked at the Dana Farmer
Cancer Institute in Cambridge City Hospital.

  The CHAIRMAN. Joanna, welcome.
  Judge BREYER. NOW, Michael, next to her, is a first-year student
at Stanford, and he is going to lead a trek into the mountains of
Wyoming this summer.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, he needs Simpson with him, then, and we
can work something out. You do not want to wander into Wyoming
without Simpson's permission, I just want you to know that.
  Senator HATCH. I am not sure you want to wander in with Simp-
son. [Laughter.]
  Judge BREYER. Nell is a recent graduate of Yale, and she is going
back up to New Haven this summer. She is teaching dance to chil-
dren up there in a special program.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome.
  Judge BREYER. Chloe, as you heard, has graduated from Harvard
and she is down here with two young women, and the three of
them are putting out a new magazine called Who Cares for public
service. Now, she will give you many copies, if you want, and order
blanks, probably.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we have a tradition here of holding up doc-
uments to make people famous, so we will be delighted to hold up
a copy of Who Cares before this is over.
  Your brother, let us get to your brother. I mean, this guy has
done you a big deal.
  Judge BREYER. My brother-in-law, who is a lawyer, and, as you
say, I guess he is extremely good on television. And my sister-in-
law, who has run a program called City Arts, which puts on public
lectures and performances in San Francisco.
  The CHAIRMAN. I welcome you all.
  Now the part that makes me the ogre with the women and men
of the press, who do not like me doing this. I would ask the photog-
raphers to please clear the well, so that we can have the nominee
make his statement and answer questions without the feeling that
we are all looking at him through the lens of a camera.
  Judge while we are clearing, a little bit of business here. After
your statement, time permitting, and I think it will, we will ask
three rounds of questioning. Three Senators will have before we
break for lunch. And for the press, who are making their decisions
in terms of timing, I expect we would break around 1 o'clock, and
that we will resume after the cloture vote- on the floor of the Senate
at 2:45 p.m., with questions to resume at that period. So, roughly
from 1 p.m. to 2:45 p.m., we will stand in recess.
                                       19
  Judge again, welcome. The floor is yours.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  At the outset, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank this commit-
tee really for the serious attention that you all have paid to my
nomination. I appreciate the members taking the time out of enor-
mously busy schedules to meet with me personally. And I recognize
that you and your staffs have really prepared thoroughly for these
hearings, and you have read the books and articles and the opin-
ions and these things I have written. It seems to me that is some
kind of new form of cruel and unusual punishment, quite a few.
  Now, there are many, many other people I would like to thank
today. I am obviously very much deeply grateful to Senator Ken-
nedy, who has given me so much over the years. I have learned
and continue to learn lessons of great value from him.
  I really want to thank very much Senator Kerry and Senator
Boxer for having come and taken the time to come here, along with
Senator Feinstein, for supporting my nomination.
  I am especially grateful to President Clinton for nominating me
to a position that I said, and I do find humbling to think about.
If I am confirmed, I will try to become a Justice whose work will
justify the confidence that he and you have placed in me.
  Now, I would like to begin by telling you a little bit about my-
self--although you have heard quite a lot--maybe, though, a few
of the experience that I think have had an important effect on my
life, how I think, and what I am.
  I was born, as you heard, and I grew up in San Francisco. I at-
tended public schools, Grant Grammar School and Lowell High
School. My mother was from St. Paul, MN. Her parents were immi-
grants from East Prussia, which is now part of Poland.
  My mother was a very intelligent, very practical, public-spirited
kind of person, and she, like many mothers, had an enormous in-
fluence on me. She was the one who made absolutely clear to me,
in no uncertain terms, that whatever intellectual ability I might
have means nothing and will not mean anything, unless I can work
with other people and use whatever talents I have to help them.
  So, I joined the Boy Scouts, I did work as a delivery boy, I did
dig ditches for the Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and I mixed salads
up in the city's summer camp. It was nice, Camp Mather, because
at that time you had policemen and firemen and lawyers and doc-
tors and businessmen and their families, and they were all there
together at the city camp for 2 weeks in the summer. It was great.
  My mother really did not want me to spend too much time with
my books. And she was right. I mean my ideas about people do not
come from libraries.
  My father was born in San Francisco. He worked as a lawyer and
as an administrator in the San Francisco Public School System for
40 years. I have his watch, as you said, Senator. He was a very
kind, very astute and very considerate man. He and San Francisco
helped me develop something I would call a trust in, almost a love
for the possibilities of a democracy.
  My father always took me. As a child, he would take me with
him into the voting booth. I would pull down the lever, and he
would always say, "We're exercising our prerogative." He would
take me to candidates' nights. Our school used to go up to Sac-
                                               20

ramento to see the legislature in session. It was Youth in Govern-
ment Day. There was Boys' State. All this led me to believe, not
just that government can help people, but that government is the
people. It is created through their active participation. And that is
really why, despite the increased cynicism about basic govern-
ment--and we have really seen vast improvement in the fairness
of government--I still believe that, with trust and cooperation and
participation, people can work through their government to im-
prove their lives.

  In 1957, as you said, I served in the Army for a little while. I
studied in England, I returned to Harvard Law School, and then
I clerked for Justice Arthur Goldberg, who became a wonderful life-
long friend. After 2 years in the Antitrust Division of the Justice
Department, I went back to Harvard to teach and to Massachusetts
to live. And for the last 27 years, I have been privileged to live in
Cambridge and work in Boston.

  I loved teaching. I loved my students. But if I were to pick out
one feature of the academic side of my life that really influenced
me especially, I think it would be this: The opportunity to study
law as a whole helped me understand that everything in the law
is related to every other thing, and always, as Holmes pointed out,
that whole law reflects not so much logic, as history and experi-
ence.

  Academic lawyers, practicing lawyers, government lawyers, and
judges, in my opinion, have a special responsibility to try to under-
stand how different parts of that seamless web of the law interact
with each other, and how legal decisions will actually work in prac-
tice to affect people and to help them.

  Working here on this committee in the 1970's, I learned a great
deal about Congress, about government and about political life.
There were disagreements to resolve, but everyone shared the
same ground rules--basic assumptions about democracy, freedom,
fairness, and the need to help others. These vast areas of widely
shared beliefs are what has shaped the law of America and the
lives of all Americans.

  Since 1980, I have been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit, and that is Maine, Massachusetts, New Hamp-
shire, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island. Because of my colleagues and
the work itself, this job is a great honor, a great privilege, and it
has been a great pleasure to have.

  I have tried to minimize what I think of as the less desirable as-
pects of the job, one that Justice Goldberg really felt strongly
about--that judges can become isolated from the people whose lives
their decisions affect. I have continued to teach and to participate
in the community and in other activities, which are important in
connecting me to the world outside the courtroom. I have been
helped in this task by my wife and her work at Dana Farber and
at Cambridge Hospital, which shows me and others some of the
sadness in this world, as well as its hopes and its joys.

  I believe that the law must work for people. The vast array of
Constitution, statutes, rules, regulations, practices and procedures,
that huge vast web, has a single basic purpose. That purpose is to
help the many different individuals who make up America--from
so many different backgrounds and circumstances, with so many
                                      21

different needs and hopes--its purpose is to help them live together
productively, harmoniously, and in freedom.

  Keeping that ultimate purpose in mind helps guide a judge
through the labyrinth of rules and regulations that the law too
often becomes, to reach what is there at bottom, the very human
goals that underlie Constitution and the statutes that Congress
writes.

  I believe, too, in the importance of listening to other points of
view. As a teacher, I discovered I could learn as much from stu-
dents as from books. On the staff of this committee, it was easy to
see how much Senators and staff alike learn from each other, from
constituents, and from hearings. I think the system works that
way. It works better than any other system. And our task is to
keep trying to improve it.

  My law school diploma refers to law simply as those wise re-
straints that make men free--women, too, all of us. I believe that,
too.

  I felt the particular importance of all this when 2 years ago, I
had the good fortune to attend a meeting of 500 judges in the new
Russia. Those judges wanted to know what words might they write
in a constitution, what words would guarantee democracy and free-
dom. That is what they were asking over a 2-day meeting. They
asked me. I mean they were interesting discussions, very interest-
ing.

  My own reply was that words alone are not sufficient, that the
words of our Constitution work because of the traditions of our peo-
ple, because the vast majority of Americans believe in democracy.
They try to be tolerant and fair to others, and to respect the liberty
of each other, even those who are unpopular, because their protec-
tion is our protection, too.

  You are now considering my appointment to the Supreme Court
of the United States. That Court works within a grand tradition
that has made meaningful, in practice, the guarantees of fairness
and of freedom that the Constitution provides. Justice Blackmun
has certainly served that tradition well. Indeed, so have all of those
who have served in the recent past, Justice White, Justice Brennan
and Justice Marshall. They leave an inspiring legacy that I have
correctly called humbling to consider.

  I promise you, and I promise the American people, that if I am
confirmed to be a member of the Supreme Court, I will try to be
worthy of that great tradition. I will work hard. I will listen. I will
try to interpret the law carefully, in accordance with its basic pur-
poses.

  Above all, I will remember that the decisions I help to make will
have an effect upon the lives of many, many Americans, and that
fact means that I must do my absolute utmost to see that those de-
cisions reflect both the letter and the spirit of a law that is meant
to help them.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I might add one thing, if I might, on a slightly different subject.
I want to add this, if I may, and that is recently I know--and this
is important to me--that in recent weeks there have been ques-
tions raised about the ethical standard that I applied in sitting on
                                               22

certain environmental cases in the first circuit at a time when I
had an investment, an insurance investment in Lloyd's.

  I recognize that this question has been raised by people of good
faith, and there is nothing more important to me than my integrity
and my reputation for impartiality. It is obviously a most impor-
tant thing to preserve public confidence and integrity in the judi-
cial branch of government.

  I have reviewed those cases again and the judicial recusal stat-
ute, and I personally am confident that my sitting in those cases
did not present any conflict of interest. Of course, my investment
was disclosed to the public. There has been absolutely no sugges-
tion that Lloyd's was involved as a named party in any of the cases
on which I saw. I know of no such involvement.

  The judicial recusal statute does recusal, as well, if you have one
case that has some kind of direct and predictable financial impact
on some investment, that is to say if it is not a speculative or re-
mote or contingent impact. The cases on which I sat did not violate
this standard, either. That issue has been carefully looked into by
independent ethics experts who share my view.

  Mr. Chairman, as I said, I recognize the importance of avoiding
conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts, and
that standard is essential for all judges, and especially essential for
judges of the Nation's highest court.

  So I certainly promise I will do all I can to meet it, including
what I shall immediately do, is ask the people who handle my in-
vestments to divest any holdings in insurance companies as soon
as possible, and with respect to Lloyd's itself, I resigned in 1988.
Though, because of one syndicate that remains open, I have been
advised that I can leave altogether by the end of 1995, but I intend
to ask the people involved to expedite my complete termination of
any Lloyd's relationship. I will be out of that as soon as I possibly
can be.

  Finally, as I go forward, I certainly will keep in mind the discus-
sion that has arisen over the last few days, and I will take it into
account in reviewing any possible conflict whatsoever.

(c) a list of all appellate opinions where your

        was affirmed;

        (1) United States v. Aversa. 984 F.2d 493 (1993) (en
        bane) (concurring opinion), cert, granted, decision
        vacated and remanded sub nom. Donovan v. United States.
        114 S. Ct. 873 (1994).

        In this case, the en bane court held that a defendant
        who, with an "innocent state of mind," violates certain
        currency laws, cannot be convicted. I wrote a
        concurring opinion expressing my general agreement with
        this view, and pointing out that a defendant who had no
        knowledge of any legal duty with regard to the currency
        transactions at issue could not have the requisite aens
       XSA for conviction. Thfe Supreme Court granted
        certiorari and vacated the decision in light of Ratzlaf
        v. United States. 114 S. Ct. 655 (1994), in which the
        Court agreed with that view.

          (2) Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Director. Office of
         Workers' Compensation Programs. 942 F.2d 811 (1991),
         cert, granted, 112 S. Ct. 1472 (1992), affirmed. 113 S.
         Ct. 692 (1993).

         A retired employee of Bath Iron Works learned (after he
         retired) that he had a work-related hearing loss, and
         applied for workers' compensation. The parties
         disagreed as to the proper method of calculating his
         benefits. I wrote for the Court of Appeals that the
         employee's partial deafness was a "scheduled"
         disability (resulting in higher benefits), rather than
         one that became disabling only after retirement, even
         if he did not discover the disability until after he
         retired. The Supreme Court, per Justice Stevens,
         affirmed, accepting the view of our circuit.

         (3) Associated Builders and Contractors of
         Massachusetts/Rhode Island v. Massachusetts Water
         Resources Authority. 935 F.2d 345 (1991) (dissenting
         opinion), cert, granted, 112 S. Ct. 1935 (1992),
         reversed sub nom. Building and Construction Trades
         Council v. Associated Builders and Contractors of
         Massachusetts/Rhode Island. 113 S. Ct. 1190 (1993).

         The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, a state
         agency, wished to enter into a prehire agreement
         requiring all contractors on the Boston Harbor cleanup
         project to abide by various union rules. In exchange,
         the unions would agree to labor peace for the duration
         of the project. The Court of Appeals held that such
         agreements were preempted by the National Labor
         Relations Act. I dissented, believing that the Act did
         not preempt this kind of agreement. Certiorari was
         granted, and in a unanimous opinion written by Justice
         Blackmun, the Supreme Court, agreeing with the dissent,
         reversed the Court of Appeals.

         (4) In re Energy Resources Co.. 871 F.2d 223 (1989),
         cert, granted, 493 U.S. 963 (1989), affirmed sub nom.
         United States v. Energy Resources Co.. 495 U.S. 545
         (1990).

         The issue in this case was whether a Bankruptcy Court
         can require certain tax payments to be applied to the
         "trust fund" portion of an employer's tax liability
         rather than the "non-trust fund" portion, if the court
         believes that designation to be necessary for a
         successful reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
         Bankruptcy Code. Our Court of Appeals held that such
        designations were within the Bankruptcy Court's power.
         The supreme Court, per Justice White, agreed with our

                                               33

                       56

 circuit (and rejected the contrary approach of other
circuits), in an 8-1 decision. Justice Blackmun
dissented without opinion.

 (5) Piper v. Supreme Court of New Hampshire. 723 F.2d
 110 (1983) (en bane), affirmed. 470 U.S. 274 (1985).

In this case, the district court found that New
Hampshire's residency requirement for members of the
New Hampshire bar violated the Privileges and
Immunities Clause. The en bane court affirmed by an
equally divided court. In a joint opinion, Chief Judge
Campbell and I expressed our view that the rule was a
reasonable means to address the state's legitimate
interest in avoiding the consequences of admitting
nonresidents as full-fledged members of the New
Hampshire bar. The Supreme Court, however, held 8-1
that New Hampshire's reasons for its rule were not
sufficient to justify the discrimination against out-
of-state lawyers. Justice Rehnquist wrote a dissenting
opinion.

 (6) Wald v. Reaan. 708 F.2d 794 (1983), cert, granted,
464 U.S. 990 (1983), reversed. 468 U.S. 222 (1984).

A Treasury Department regulation prevented persons
traveling to Cuba from paying incidental travel
expenses, thus making such travel nearly impossible.
Our Court of Appeals held that the regulation was
promulgated without statutory authority, and that it
was therefore invalid. In a 5-4 decision, Justice
Rehnquist wrote an opinion reversing the decision.
Justice Blackmun, in a lengthy dissent, agreed with our
view of the statutes at issue in the case.

(7) Lydon v. Justices of the Boston Municipal Court.
698 F.2d 1 (1982), cert, granted, 463 U.S. 1206 (1983),
reversed. 466 U.S. 294 (1984).

This case focused on Massachusetts' "two-tier" criminal
trial system. The Court of Appeals (in a 2-1 decision)
held that once a habeas court has found that the
evidence in the defendant's "first-tier" trial was
constitutionally insufficient to support conviction,
the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a "second tier"
retrial. The Supreme Court reversed, a majority
holding that a defendant's jeopardy did not "terminate"
after his "first-tier" trial. The Justices disagreed
on the precise reason, but all concurred in the
judgment of reversal.

(8) Keeton v. Hustler Magazine. 682 F.2d 33 (1982),

                                      34
                            57

        cert, granted, 459 U.S. 1169 (1983), reversed. 465 U.S.
        770 (1984).

        Plaintiff sued defendant for libel in New Hampshire,
        the only state in which the relevant statute of
        limitations had not run. Defendant's contacts with New
        Hampshire consisted of the fact that less than 1% of
        its magazines were sent there for circulation. The
        Court of Appeals held that these contacts were so small
        that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over
        defendant would violate the Due Process clause. The
        Supreme Court reversed, holding that because defendant
        sent magazines into New Hampshire for distribution,
        jurisdiction could be found in that state.

         (9) N.L.R.B. v. Transportation Mcmt. Corp.. 674 F.2d
        130 (1982) (concurring opinion), cert, granted, 459
        U.S. 1014 (1982), reversed. 462 U.S. 393 (1983).

        In this case, the Court of Appeals issued a per curiam
        opinion refusing to enforce an NLRB order. The Supreme
        Court reversed; Justice White wrote for a unanimous
        Court that the Board's construction of the statute at
        issue was reasonable and the order should therefore be
        enforced.

b. 1. What has been the general character of your law
                 practice, dividing it into periods with dates if
                  its character has changed over the years?

                                               39
         I have not had a conventional law practice,
        although before I became a judge, I occasionally
        consulted for various private law firms, most
        often on issues of antitrust law and regulation.

2. Describe your typical former clients and the
        areas, if any, in which you have specialized.

        Between 1967 and 1980, I did consulting work for
        clients which included:

        a. A steel company engaged in a merger with a
                 smaller, failing steel company. The legal
                 issue involved the lawfulness of the merger
                 under the antitrust laws.

        b. A chain of supermarkets seeking to engage in
                 low price sales out of cartons directly to
                 shoppers. The legal issue involved the
                 lawfulness of regulations that seemed to
                 prohibit the practice (as a matter of
                 administrative law).

        c. Tenants organizations challenging rent
                 control regulations in Cambridge. The issue
                 was whether the regulations effectively
                 carried out the intent of the regulatory
                 statute as a matter of regulatory policy and
                 administrative law.

        d. A grocery chain seeking to sell milk in
                 Staten Island. The issue was whether
                 administrative rulings that inhibited new
                 entry were sound and lawful under the
                 regulatory statute.

        Most of my clients have had problems of antitrust
        law, administrative law, or regulatory law or
        policy.

1. Did you appear in court frequently, occasionally,
        or not at all? If the frequency of your
        appearances in court varied, describe each such
        variance, giving dates.

        While at the Antitrust Division, I worked on
        briefs in federal appellate cases and argued one
        case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth
        Circuit. After leaving the Department of Justice,
         in my occasional practice, I assisted in the
        preparation of a few briefs.

                                      40
                                 63

               2) What percentage of these appearances was in:

                        (a) federal courts;

                        (b) state courts of record;

                        (c) other courts.

                       All briefs on which I worked were submitted to
                       federal courts; my only argument was in federal
                       court.

                                                                                   /

               3) What percentage of your litigation was:

                        (a) civil;

                        (b) criminal.

                       In the Antitrust Division, my work was
                       approximately 70% civil and 30% criminal. The two
                       cases in which I signed the briefs were both civil
                       cases. My work with the Watergate Special
                       Prosecution Force involved investigation in
                       criminal matters, the development of cases, and
                       recommendations on whether to prosecute.

               4) State the number of cases in courts of record you
                       tried to verdict or judgment (rather than
                       settled), indicating whether you were sole
                       counsel, chief counsel, or associate counsel.

                       None.

               5) What percentage of these trials was:

                        (a) jury;
                                                                                       «

                        (b) non-jury.
                       Not applicable.

16. Litigation: Describe the ten most significant
        litigated natters which you personally handled. Give
       the citations, if the cases were reported, and the
       docket number and date if unreported. Give a capsule
       summary of the substance of each case. Identify the
       party or parties whom you represented; describe in

                                                 41
             64

detail the nature of your participation in the
litigation and the final disposition of the case. Also
state as to each case:

a) the date of representation;

b) the name of the court and the name of the judge or
        judges before whom the case was litigated; and

c) the individual names, addresses, and telephone
       numbers of co-counsel and of principal counsel for
       each of the other parties.

Identify each case you personally argued in court. Please
provide a copy of all briefs on which your name appears. If
copies are unavailable to you, please identify the case and
court.

Note: All of these matters concern practice before I became
a judge. I have answered the portion of this question
relating to counsel and co-counsel to the best of my
ability; however, I have not maintained detailed files on
such matters.

(1) Bratcher v. Akron Area Board of Realtors. 381 F.2d 723
        (6th Cir. 1967) (Edwards, Phillips, Cecil).

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice argued
that real estate dealers violated the antitrust laws when
they agreed not to show houses in white neighborhoods to
African-American customers. I developed this theory, wrote
the brief, and argued the case for the Department of Justice
before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. (We
appeared as amicus supporting plaintiffs.) The plaintiffs
prevailed. The brief is included in Appendix VII.

         Bennett), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1009 (1978).

A number of federal judges contended that it was
unconstitutional for one House of Congress to veto a pay
raise for federal judges. They claimed that a "one-house
veto" is unconstitutional. They also contended that for
Congress to refuse to adjust judges' salaries with inflation
over a period of many years unconstitutionally "diminished"
their pay. I was the second counsel on the case, working
with Arthur Goldberg, who was the lead counsel for the
judges. I briefed the case in the Court of Claims (where we
lost, 4-3, on the "one-house veto" issue); I briefed our
position on a certified question to the Supreme Court on the
issue of whether federal judges could hear this case in
light of their financial interest in its outcome (which was
dismissed without opinion, but the Court of Claims resolved
the issue in our favor), and I briefed our petition for
certiorari to the Supreme Court (which was denied). The
case was significant both for the "one-house veto" issue and
for the substantive question regarding diminishment of
judges' pay. The briefs are included in Appendix V I I .

(3) United States v. Arnold Schwinn & Co.. 388 U . S . 365
(1967)

In this case, the Justice Department argued that vertically
imposed territorial restrictions should be unlawful under
the antitrust laws, except for * new entrant, or, possibly,
a failing company. The case was argued in the Supreme
Court, which decided in our favor, but held the restrictions
were unlawful in all instances. This per se rule was later
overturned.

I briefed the case for the Antitrust Division, where I was

(4) United States v. Continental Oil Co.. 387 U.S. 424
(1967)

The Justice Department attacked the merger of two oil
refineries in New Mexico, under Clayton Act sec. 7. The
case was on direct appeal to the Supreme Court (under the
Expediting Act). It involved a complex market definition
question, for market share figures varied depending upon
whether oil outside New Mexico, but in the New Mexico
pipeline, was counted as part of the market.

I briefed the case for the Antitrust Division. It was
revised by the Solicitor General and filed in the Supreme
Court. The United States won the case (the decision below
was vacated and remanded in light of United States v. Pabst
Brewing Co.. 384 U.S. 546 (1967). Its significance lies in
the principles used to help define a "market" for antitrust
purposes.

(5) United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co.. 389 U.S. 308

The Justice Department appealed from a District Court
decision that held that Penn-Salt and Olin-Mathieson could
form a joint venture because they were not potential
competitors in the chemical business in the Southeastern

                                               44
             67

U.S. The Department claimed that the court did not use the
correct criteria to determine when one firm "potentially
competes" with another. It argued for an "objective,"
instead of a "subjective," test.

I wrote the brief for the Antitrust Division, which was
filed with changes by the Solicitor General in the U.S.
Supreme Court. The United States lost the case, when the
decision was affirmed by an equally divided court.

Kleindienst. (unreported U.S. Dist. Ct. D.C. 1974) (Hart)

These two cases in the District Court for the District of
Columbia both involved charges of perjury, the first against
the former Lieutenant Governor of California, the second
against the former Attorney General of the United States.
Mr. Reinecke's conviction was reversed; Mr. Kleindienst was
found guilty of a misdemeanor.

These cases were the eventual outcome of the work, mostly of
others, for my work took place only at their initial stages.
I helped organize the ITT (Dita Beard) portion of the
Watergate Special Prosecutor's investigation. The work
primarily involved investigation, organization of facts,
development of legal cases, and a recommendation of whether
the office should proceed to prosecute. The Special
Prosecutor determined that the main charge in the matter --
that ITT's contribution to the Nixon Presidential campaign
influenced the government's action in antitrust cases
against it -- was not borne out by the evidence.

N.E.2d 297, 380 Mass. 762 (1980) (Hennessy, Quirico,
Braucher, Kaplan, Liacos)

This case involved a challenge to a rule requiring
disclosure of prices by supermarkets. The Attorney
General's office had issued a general rule requiring that
the price be marked on each item. Purity owned a special
low price "warehouse type" retail food store. Customers
picked items out of crates, and, while the prices were
clearly marked on the crates, individual items were marked
only with a UPC symbol to be scanned at the cashier. To
force the store to take each item out of the crate, mark it,
and put it on the shelf would have destroyed the low price
advantage. Representing Purity, we challenged the rule on
the ground that to apply the old rule to this new unforeseen
situation required more elaborate hearings or a
reconsideration of the issue. The court ruled in favor of
the Attorney General.

(Tamm, Fahy, Bazelon), affirming 364 F. Supp. 1075 (D.D.C.

This case challenged the constitutionality of the "pocket
veto" when exercised during a short congressional recess.
The District Court for the District of Columbia held that a
bill could not be "pocket-vetoed" during such a recess. The
DC Circuit affirmed. I wrote a draft of a brief, which was
revised by Senator Kennedy's staff. (Senator Kennedy
proceeded pro se.)

        activities you have pursued, including significant
        litigation that did not progress to trial or legal natters
        that did not involve litigation. Describe fully the nature
        of your participation in these activities. Please list any
        clients or organizations for whom you performed lobbying
        activities and describe the lobbying activities you
        performed on behalf of such client(s). (Note: As to any
        facts requested in this question, please omit any
        information protected by the attorney-client privilege.)

Airline Deregulation. From 1974 through 1978, I worked with
Senator Kennedy and the Judiciary Committee in the effort to
deregulate airlines. In this capacity, on leave from
Harvard in 1974, I organized hearings investigating Civil
Aeronautics Board regulation of the airline industry and
wrote a detailed report of the Subcommittee's findings. The
hearings and the report helped to increase public awareness
of the issue. In turn, changes began within the CAB itself
and, eventually, legislation which I participated in
drafting was enacted by Congress to substitute competition
for the previously existing regulatory system. The details
of this work are contained in Chapter 16 of Breyer,
Regulation and Its Reform (Harvard Press, 1982), and a copy
of the report is included in Appendix I.

Trucking Deregulation. I participated in the effort to
deregulate the trucking indurtry first as a consultant to
the Judiciary Committee and later as its chief counsel. I
helped to supervise and edit the Committee Report on the
trucking industry, and I was involved in the drafting of new
legislation and the negotiations that led to its adoption.

                             71

Other Legislation. As chief counsel of the Judiciary
Committee, I supervised the drafting of legislation, helped
to organize the legislative hearings, negotiations, and
activities needed to enact a bill into law. Major
legislative items in which I participated to a significant
extent include the following:

        Fair Housing. This legislation was designed to
        strengthen the fair housing laws by providing an
        administrative mechanism for their enforcement. A fair
        housing bill ultimately passed the Congress, although
        not in the exact form of the original bill.

         Institutionalized Persons. The Committee developed and
        reported legislation that would allow the Justice
        Department to intervene in cases designed to protect
        the constitutional rights of institutionalized persons.
        The bill became law.

        Criminal Code. This major legislative project
        consisted of rewriting the Criminal Code of the United
        States. In 1980, it was reported by both the Senate
        and House Judiciary Committees. It did not pass
        Congress, but sections, including the Sentencing
        Guidelines, later became law.

        Stanford Daily Case. The Committee developed a bill in
        response to the Supreme Court's ruling in the Stanford
        Daily case which allowed police searches of press
        offices. The new law, enacted by Congress, required
        that information be obtained by subpoena or similar
        process and that searches (with warrants) be conducted
        only as a last resort in limited circumstances, when,
        for example, there was reason to believe the
         information would otherwise be destroyed.

        Court Reform. The Committee dealt with several bills
        affecting the courts directly. For example, a
         "judicial discipline" bill was enacted into law.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Activities.

        Siting legislation. In 1973, I worked as a member of
        the Governor's Energy Commission in Massachusetts to
        develop legislation that created an "energy facilities
        siting council." This bill became law, providing a
         "one-stop" procedure for obtaining permission from
        state agencies for the building of energy facilities.

        Telephone regulations. In the late 1970s, I appeared
        pro bono before the Massachusetts Public Service
        Commission urging a change in the billing practices of

                                               49
                                  72

                  the telephone company. The company kept categories of
                  "credit risk" and those in the higher risk categories
                  would have their phone service terminated at very short
                  notice upon falling only a few weeks behind in the
                  payment of their bills. I urged that the telephone
                  company should have to notify users of their credit
                  categories, explain the basis of categorization, and
                  give the users opportunities to challenge their
                  categorization or "improve" their categories. The
                  suggestions were adopted.

                  Milk Marketing. I worked as a consultant to a grocery
                  firm, and appeared as an expert witness, before the New
                  York Milk Marketing Board, arguing that the firm should
                  be allowed to market milk in Staten Island. I argued
                  that the current restrictive regulations led to higher
                  milk prices. The application was denied.

                  Federal Sentencing Guidelines. I was a member of the
                  United States Sentencing Commission from 1985 to 1989
                  and helped to draft the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
                  The Commission was created by Congress to reduce
                  disparity in sentencing and to increase honesty in
                  sentencing, so that the offender would actually serve
                  the prison sentence that the judge imposed.

                  Law teaching activities. See answer to question 18.

                  I have not engaged in lobbying activities for any
                  client or organization.

        A. Harvard University

                  I joined the faculty of Harvard Law School in 1967 as
                 an Assistant Professor of Law. In 1970, I became a
                 full professor, a position I held until 1980, when I
                 became a judge. I was also a professor at the Kennedy
                 School of Government of Harvard University during the
                 years 1977 to 1980. From 1980 to the present, I have
                 continued to teach at Harvard as a Lecturer in Law. I
                 should add that many of the courses I have taught have
                 been offered jointly by the Law School and the Kennedy
                 School.

           II. FINANCIAL DATA AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PUBLIC)

1. List sources, amounts and dates of all anticipated
         receipts from deferred income arrangements, stock
         options, uncompleted contracts and other future
         benefits which you expect to derive from previous
         business relationships, professional services, firm
         memberships, former employers, clients, or customers.
         Please describe the arrangements you have made to be
         compensated in the future for any financial or business
         interest.

         None, but please note that I have a TIAA-CREF pension plan
         with Harvard that has vested, and which I would keep. Its
         value is disclosed in the answer to question 5.

2. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of
         interest, including the procedure you will follow in
         determining these areas of concern. Identify the categories
         of litigation and financial arrangements that are likely to
         present potential conflicts of interest during your initial
         service in the position to which you have been nominated.

         If confirmed, I would seek to follow all the requirements of
         the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, the Ethics
         Reform Act of 1989, 28 U.S.C. § 455, and cases interpreting
         the statutory requirements.

         I currently give to the clerk of court, and to my secretary
         and law clerks, lists of all my investments, which they
         check against each case, in order to make certain that I am
         recused in any case in which I have a financial interest in
         a party to the case.

3. Do you have any plans, commitments, or agreements to pursue
         outside employment, with or without compensation, during
         your service with the Court? If so, explain.

         I have no present plans to do so, although I may, if it is
         consistent with my duties on the court and with the
         applicable ethical standards, continue to lecture, write,
         and teach.

4. List sources and amounts of all income received during
         the calendar year preceding your nomination and for the
         current calendar year, including all salaries, fees,
         dividends, interest, gifts, rents, royalties, patents,
         honoraria, and other items exceeding $500 or more. (If

        you prefer, copies of the financial disclosure report
        required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 may be
         substituted here.)

        A copy of the Financial Disclosure Report required by the
         Ethics in Government Act of 1978, filed on or around May 10,
         1994, for the calendar year 1993, is attached as Addendum C.

        An AO-10 form for the current year is being prepared and
        will be supplied as soon as it is available. As of January
         1, 1994, none of my children is any longer my dependent. I
        therefore will not include them on my 1994 disclosure
        report, nor will I claim any of them as a dependent on my
         1994 tax return.

5. Please complete the attached financial net worth
        statement in detail (add schedules as called for).

        Attached as Addendum D.

6. Have you ever held a position or played a role in a
        political campaign? If so, please identify the particulars
        of the campaign, including the candidate, dates of the
        campaign, your title and responsibilities.

        Please supply one copy of any memoranda analyzing
        issues of law or public policy that you wrote on behalf
        of or in connection with a presidential transition
        team.

        No, though in 1976 I was the Cambridge "uncommitted"
        delegate nominee for the Democratic National Convention.
         (The "uncommitted" slate lost the primary election.)

        As for transition-related memoranda, in 1992, I gave a
        speech on the Sentencing Guidelines before the D.C. Circuit
        Conference (see publications listing above) and
        subsequently, Professor Philip Heymann, who, I believe, was
        working on the presidential transition, requested a copy of
        the speech, which I provided. I attach the cover memo to
        the speech as Addendum E.

                                       III. GENERAL (PUBLIC)

1. An ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the American Bar
         Association's Code of Professional Responsibility calls for
         "every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or
         professional workload, to find some time to participate in
         serving the disadvantages" Describe what you have done to
         fulfill these responsibilities, listing specific instances
         and the amount of time devoted to each.

         A guiding principle in my professional and personal life has
         been a commitment to fairness. To this end, my teaching,
         writing, and lecturing have emphasized a commonsense
         approach to the law that makes justice accessible to all in
         our society. Since graduating from law school three decades
         ago, my professional life has been devoted to government
         service (in the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial
         Branches) and to teaching and education.

         Throughout my career, without compensation and frequently
         for non-profit entities, I have participated in discussions
         and given lectures on a variety of public policy subjects.
         (See, e.g.. the answer to question 12c in Section I.) I
         have also worked, without compensation, for and with various
         government entities and private foundations on particular
        public interest projects. For instance, I served as a
        member of the Harvard-Ford Foundation Steering Committee on
        the "Inquiry into Public Policy Concerning Children in
        America." As a trustee of the University of Massachusetts,
         I worked to ensure that educational opportunities were
         available to all, regardless of background. In the late
         1970s, I appeared pro bono before the Massachusetts Public
         Service Commission to urge that the telephone company should
        not be permitted to cut off phone service without fairly
        notifying users and providing them with an opportunity to
        challenge their termination or to improve their credit
         situation.

         I have also been a trustee of the Dana Farber Cancer
         Institute. As a member of the White House Fellows regional
        selection committee, I have attempted to help provide
         leadership in supporting success of individuals from a broad
        spectrum of backgrounds and providing opportunities based on
        merit.

         I have also participated, while a judge, in numerous efforts
        to encourage pro bono bar activities.

2. The American Bar Association's Commentary to its Code of
        Judicial Conduct states that it is inappropriate for a judge

        organization had during that period;

b. the purpose of the club or organization
        (e.g., social, business, fraternal or mixed),
        the frequency with which you used the
        facilities, and whether you used the club or
        organization for business entertainment;

c. whether, while you were a member of such club
        or organization, it did or did not include
        members of all races, religions, and both
        sexes;

d. if the club or organization did not do so,

        (1) state whether this was the result
                of a policy or practice of the club
                or organization;

        (2) if so, describe in full the reasons
                for this policy or practice and any
                actions you took to change that
               policy or practice;

        (3) if you were a member of such club or
               organization while serving as a U.S.
               Circuit Judge, please give your opinion
               as to whether the club or organization
               practiced invidious discrimination
               within the meaning of the ABA Code of
               Judicial Conduct, and give the reasons
                for your opinion.

         The Harvard Club has had members of all races and religions
         and both sexes since I have been a member. The Cambridge
         Tennis Club has members of all races and religions and both
         sexes. The Nisi Prius Club has African-American members, as
         well as members of various religions and both sexes. The
         Lawyers' Club, an informal group that meets for dinner at
         individuals' homes six times a year, has members of various
         religions and both sexes, but no African-American members.
         The Saturday Club has African-American members, as well as
         members of various religions and both sexes. When I joined
         in 1985, it had women members but no African-Americans. The
         Curtis Club has had members of all races, religions, and
         both sexes since I have been a member.

3. Please describe your experience in the entire judicial
         selection process, from beginning to end (including the
         circumstances which led to your nomination and the
         interviews in which you participated). List all interviews
         or communications you had with the White House staff or the
         Justice Department regarding this nomination, the dates of
         such interviews or communications, and all persons present
         or participating in such interviews or communications.

         With regard to the Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice
         Blackmun's announcement of his retirement, I had one
         conversation with Lloyd Cutler, Special Counsel to the
         President, on April 15, 1994. At his request, I sent him

                                                        57
                                    80

         follow-up information about our payment of Social Security
         taxes for our cleaning person. On May 13, 1994, I received
         a telephone call from the President in which he expressed
        his intention to nominate me.

4. Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a
         judicial nominee (including but not limited to any member of
         the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate
         or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal
         issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be
         interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances
        concerning your position on such case, issue, or question?
         If so, please explain fully. Please identify each
        communication you had during the six months prior to the
        announcement of your nomination with any member of the White
        House staff, the Justice Department or the Senate or its
        staff referring or relating to your views on any case, issue
        or subject that could come before the United States Supreme
        Court, state who was present or participated in such
        communication, and describe briefly what transpired.

        No.

5. Please discuss your views of the judiciary in our
        governmental system and the following criticism of "judicial
        activism."

        The role of the Federal judiciary within the Federal
        government, and within society generally, has become the
        subject of increasing controversy in recent years. It has
        become the target of both popular and academic criticism
        that alleges that the judicial branch has usurped many of
        the prerogatives of other branches and levels of government.
        Some of the characteristics of this "judicial activism" have
        been said to include:

        a. A tendency by the judiciary toward problem-solution
                 rather than grievance-resolution;

        b. A tendency by the judiciary to employ the individual
                 plaintiff as a vehicle for the imposition of far-
                 reaching orders extending to broad classes of
                 individuals;

        c. A tendency by the judiciary to impose broad,
                 affirmative duties upon governments and society;

        d. A tendency by the judiciary toward loosening
                 jurisdictional requirements such as standing and
                 ripeness; and

                                                        58
                                     81

        e. A tendency by the judiciary to impose itself upon
                 other institutions in the manner of an administrator
                 with continuing oversight responsibilities.

        Under our constitutional system of government, it is the
        task of the courts to resolve the controversies that come
        before them by applying the relevant law -- statutes, common
         law, regulations, or constitutional law -- to the facts of
        the specific cases they must consider. Criticism of so-
        called "judicial activism" raises questions of both the
         legitimacy and the competence of the courts in particular
        areas.

        Historically, under our tri-partite system of constitutional
        government, we have assigned the initiative for proactive,
       .affirmative, widespread reform and problem-solving to our
         legislatures, both federal and state, and, increasingly, to
        the executive branch. Nevertheless, if the legislature or
        the executive either acts or fails to act in a manner that
        results in a violation of individual rights, the courts'
        role must include the difficult and sensitive task of
        defining an appropriate judicial remedy. In deciding cases
        and defining remedies, courts must be always mindful of the
        appropriate role of the judiciary.

        In addition to the question of legitimacy, the judiciary is
        ill-equipped to make broad reaching policy determinations.
        A judge seeking to solve a general social problem is less
        likely to have available all the relevant facts than a
        legislature or executive entity. Judges, moreover, do not
        have the resources that are available to administrators and
        are, therefore, less able to engage in effective management
        and administration.

        That said, in order to be fair in this assessment, one must
        recognize that legislatures and executive entities have
        sometimes failed to address problems until constitutional
        violations resulted. It would be vastly preferable for all
        branches of government -- and for the public -- if the
        political branches were able to resolve such issues and
        render their determination through judicial adjudication
        unnecessary.

6. Approximately how many individuals have been employed by you
        as law clerks and support staff since you have been a United
        States Circuit Judge?

        State separately the numbers, and describe briefly the
        duties of (1) women, (2) African-Americans, and (3) members
        of other racial minority groups, whom you so employed.

                                                        59
                        82

law clerks: 4 6
secretaries: 6
The law clerks include 12 women, 2 of whom are
Hispanic; 2 Hispanic men; and 1 Pakistani man. As for
secretaries, all 6 were women.
Of the 8 law clerks to whom I have extended circuit
court clerkship offers for the next two years (and who
have accepted), 3 are women (one of whom is African-
American) , one is an Asian-American man, and one is an
Hispanic man.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge.
  Again, a housekeeping matter. As I understand it, you would
rather not take a break. One of our tendencies, as you remember
when you used to sit back here, is that we get to get up after we
ask our questions and make our phone calls and make our visits,
and you do not get to move as long as someone is up here asking
you questions. So I want to be clear that we want to accommodate
you. It is kind of hard sitting there all this time answering ques-
tions.
  Now, as I understand it, though, you would like to proceed with
one round of questioning, and then we will take a 5-minute break
and come back and hear from Senators Hatch and Kennedy, and
then we will break for lunch. Is that how you would prefer to pro-
ceed?
  Judge BREYER. That is fine, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, let me begin by saying, in recent years,
we have seen new challenges to the efforts of government at all lev-
els to adopt regulations that government believes are designed to
protect the environment and promote a public goal. These chal-
lenges have taken the form of asking the Court to change how it
has interpreted the takings cause of the fifth amendment.
  Less than 3 weeks ago, the Supreme Court of the United States
decided a case called Dolan v. Tigert, where, using the takings
clause, the Court rejected a local town measure intended to reduce
flooding and traffic congestion caused by a business' development
along a river. This decision follows a case decided 2 years earlier,
Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, and in these cases the
Court adopted a new standard for reviewing the takings clause.
  Judge, my first question is, before the Dolan and Lucas cases,
how did the Supreme Court review claims that a regulation de-
signed and stated to be designed to safeguard public welfare was
the taking of property, thereby requiring the Government to pay
the landowner for the so-called taking? What was the law, as you
understand it, prior to Dolan and Lucas? What standard did the
Court use?
  Judge BREYER. Mr. Chairman, I think usually, when I go back
to basics, what I often try to do is I try to keep in my mind some
kind of basic, two or three basic points in different areas which are
sometimes helpful.
  The basic point or the basic case or the basic idea I have in my
mind in this area is I go back to a case Justice Holmes decided.
It is actually a very interesting case. A person owned a coal mine,
and the Government said here is what you ought to do: Leave some
columns of coal in that mine, because if you do not leave big thick
columns of coal, the whole ceiling will collapse, and there are cities
that are built on top of that coal mine and they are all going to
fall down, and, therefore, we will have a regulation which tells you
big thick coal columns. But the owner said I agree with you, I don't
want anything to happen to anyone on the surface.
  But, really, you don't have to have columns that are that thick,
you don't have to have that many, and what you have done is
taken my coal.
  So the case presented the issue of when is it a reasonable regula-
tion, for, after all, it is a good purpose to stop the cities from falling
                                      Ill
into the mine. I mean that is a wonderful purpose. When does a
reasonable regulation become a taking of property for which you
must pay compensation? You know what Justice Holmes said. You
are going to be disappointed, but what he said was this. He said,
"You can regulate, you can regulate, you don't have to compensate,
when you regulate. But, Government, you cannot go too far."

  What is too far? Indeed, ever since that time, the courts have
been trying to work out what is too far, and I don't think anyone
has gotten a perfect measure of that. They look into factors, they
say how important is the regulation, what kind of reliance has
there been on this, has there been a physical, a physical occupation
of property.

  You see, in the case you have, which is very interesting, the one
you mentioned, there might have been a physical taking of a piece
of property, and then the Government can do less. But as I looked
through these cases thereafter, you always come back to what is
a kind of human judgment, what is too far. And the more reason-
able what you are doing is, the less reliance there has been, the
less it looks like it is taking something that historically has been
considered a person's physical property, the more likely it is that
you don't have to compensate.

  The CHAIRMAN. Isn't the issue, Judge, what you said, whether
the Government has gone too far? Most observers and legal schol-
ars have referenced Lucas and then recently Dolan as evidence of
the fact that the Court is changing that standard of how they de-
termine what is too far. As you know better than I, Judge, in Lucas
and in Dolan, but in Dolan, in particular, two things changed that
seem to me to be different. I would like to talk with you a moment
in the same general sense you discussed in the Holmes case.

  In the past, if a Government agency said we are regulating for
the public welfare so cities do not fall in, the burden has basically
been on the property owner to say, you know, you have gone too
far, Government, and here is why. Second, it has been generally
speaking the Government, the Court has looked and said has the
government had a rational basis for doing this, have they had a
reason that comports with some sense of what seems to be related
here, and, if they have, we will accept that, unless the plaintiff can
prove, the property owner can prove that they have gone too far.

  Well, as I read Dolan, two things happened. Granted, it is a case
not of great moment in terms of what was at stake, in terms of a
bicycle path and a flood plain and an extension of a permit to be
able to make a hardware store larger, and so on, but it did two
things. One, it shifted the burden of proof to the Government, and,
to the best of my knowledge, I think that is the first time in 70
or 80 years the Court has done that. It has explicitly said, hey,
look, Government, now you have got to prove, not the plaintiff, you
have got to prove that this regulation was necessary and that you
didn't go too far.

  The second thing it did was it established what might be a new
rule of construction, a new canon, one might argue, that says that
the taking has to be roughly proportional to the needs. It took that
bar and raised it just a little bit higher.

  Now, my question is this: Is there any doubt in your mind, after
Dolan and after Lucas, that it is at least incrementally more dif-
                                      112
ficult for the Government to regulate zoning and environmental
laws than it was prior, not impossible, but just incrementally at
least more difficult, or am I off on that?

  Judge BREYER. NO, no, you are not off on that. Absolutely, the
dissent you see in that absolutely thought that was so. The reason
I hesitate a little bit is there is something special about that case,
and what is I think a little special about the case is that it did at
least arguably involve a physical occupation of a piece of property,
and at the same time they didn't make all that much out of it.
Then, as you just pointed out, they used this test of rough propor-
tionality, and what exactly is that, it looks as if it is a little tough-
er.

  So where I end up in my mind is that this is an area that is not
determined forever, that there are likely to be quite a few cases
coming up, that this problem of how you work out when it goes too
far is something that undoubtedly will come up again in the future,
and there is a degree of flexibility and flux in these opinions that
I think haven't made a definite decision forever. That is basically
my state of mind on them at the moment.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, mine, as well, and, therefore, it raises a se-
ries of--again, the Court did not do what I am about to say. But
if you juxtapose what the Court did do, that incremental change
that it made, with some of the leading legal experts and minds in
this area--Professor Epstein comes to mind--it is hard, to use a
phrase often used by Judge Bork, it is hard to find a principled ra-
tionale for how and where this stops, because the burden is a big
deal.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, it is.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is a big deal in terms of outcome, whomever
has the burden. We understand that in terms of criminal law. We
understand that if the defendant had the burden to prove that he
or she was innocent, it makes a big difference, the same facts, the
same circumstances, it would make a big difference. In these cases,
which affect economic rights and affect public health and welfare,
whomever has the burden makes a big difference.
  Now, as you know, Judge Breyer, this is not the first time the
Supreme Court has of late elevated--I do not want to be pejorative
here--has moved the bar on economic rights.
  In the early part of this century, as mentioned by my friend from
Utah, in the so-called Lochner era, named after the leading case of
the time, the Supreme Court routinely struck down health and
safety measures as unconstitutional. The Court struck down the
types of regulation that everyone in this room now considers nor-
mal and appropriate. It struck down minimum wage laws, which
we now take for granted, it struck down child labor laws, and it
struck down workplace safety laws. The Court finally changed
course and put an end to the so-called Lochner-izing toward the
end of the 1930's.
  Now, would our society look different today, if the Supreme
Court had not gone back on Lochner and still gave economic rights
the same level of protection that it did during the Lochner era?
What effect would there have been on labor laws, for example, and
environmental laws, had West Coast Hotel v. Parrish not come
along and overruled Lochner? Talk to us about that. Be a professor
                                      113
for a minute here. Tell us what the effect would be, as you would
see it.

  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, that you would have very, very
wide agreement with you across a very, very wide spectrum with
what Holmes said, that the Constitution does not enact into law
Herbert Spencer's social statics. What he meant by that is there is
no particular theory of the economy that the Constitution enacts
into law.

  That does not mean property has no protection. There is a
takings clause in the Constitution. It does not mean that people's
clothes and toothbrushes are somehow at stake and could be swept
away randomly. What it means is that the Constitution, which is
a document that basically wants to guarantee people rights, that
will enable them to lead lives of dignity, foresees over the course
of history that a person's right to speak freely and to practice his
religion is something that is of value, is not going to change.

  But one particular economy theory or some other economic the-
ory is a function of the circumstances of the moment. And if the
world changes so that it becomes crucially important to all of us
that we protect the environment, that we protect health, that we
protect safety, the Constitution is not a bar to that, because its
basic object is to permit people to lead lives of dignity.

  The CHAIRMAN. I agree with your analysis, and you state it very
clearly. Now, I understand that there is a significant distinction, a
difference between the 5th amendment analysis engaged in Dolan
and Lucas and the analysis of Lochner analyzing the 14th amend-
ment, in finding the substantive due process right to freedom of
contract, which is related to the 14th amendment.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand Lochner went far beyond the ques-
tion of takings. But if we follow Dolan and Lucas to their logical
end, I do not see--I am not suggesting that the Court has done
that, but if we do, I do not see how different it is from Lochner in
its practical effect.
  It is clear to me that there are some very significant legal minds
who are arguing that essentially we find, in the 5th amendment in
the takings clause, what had been done in the 14th amendment,
which is now totally discredited.
  Now, in the past, as I said, the courts gave Government the ben-
efit of the doubt when its actions were challenged as unconstitu-
tional. Doesn't the importance of both Lochner and Dolan lie in the
fact that they refuse to give the Government the benefit of the
doubt, by putting the burden of proof on the Government?
  Judge BREYER. The kind of thing, Senator, that you are con-
cerned about I think was a concern of the dissent, and I know that
there are people and commentators thoughtfully reading these
cases who worry about, well, how far will they go. When I think
about that, I think, well, this is a matter, if you actually look at
the case itself, that is still up in the air, and I think it is very wide-
ly accepted.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is why I am trying to get you to talk about
it, because you may bring it down to the ground.
  Judge BREYER. Here I have a problem talking about things that
are up in the air, for this reason, and I will be very frank with you.
                                      114
Let us imagine, if I am lucky and if you find me qualified and vote
to confirm me, I will be a member of the Supreme Court, and, as
a member of that Court, I will consider with an open mind the
cases that arise in that Court. And there is nothing more important
to a judge than to have an open mind and to listen carefully to the
arguments.

  So I am trying both at the same time, and I will throughout
these hearings--and tell me if you feel I am not striking the right
balance--I will try very hard to give you an impression, an under-
standing of how I think about legal problems of all different kinds.
At the same time, I do not want to predict or commit myself on an
open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court. The reason
for that is two, there are two real reasons.

  The first real reason is how often it is when we express ourselves
casually or express ourselves without thorough briefing and thor-
ough thought about a matter that I or some other judge might
make a mistake. And when you get the thorough briefing and thor-
ough thought, you find, when you really look into it, that the mat-
ter somehow strikes you as not right to what you said before.

  The other reason, which is equally important, is if you were a
lawyer or if I was a lawyer or any of us appearing before a court
or a client, it is so important that the clients and the lawyers un-
derstand the judges are really open-minded. That is why I will
hesitate sometimes and

  The CHAIRMAN. SO far you have been very responsive, and I am
not looking for you to give me an answer of how you would rule
in any one case. But I am looking to ask you to do what you have
begun to do, and that is articulate for us your view of the prin-
cipled way in which you think we should approach these matters
of constitutional import.

  What I have attempted to establish thus far is that where this
balance goes is of phenomenal consequence to the Nation.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Not where you are going to take it. It is of a
multi-trillion-dollar consequence to the Nation.
  To overstate it, if, for example, we adopted the view proposed by
some very articulate, brilliant legal scholars, which says that you
really have to apply a tort standard in determining whether or not
a taking has, in fact, occurred, what we would find is that if tomor-
row we passed any law here and said, by the way, no more CFC's
can be admitted into the atmosphere, we would have every com-
pany that now manufactures CFC's come to us and say, you know,
that is a great idea. But because you cannot prove if we manufac-
tured CFC's and they deplete the ozone layer--you cannot prove
that Lloyd Cutler got cancer or Joe Biden got cancer because of
that--because you cannot prove that, we will stop but you have to
pay us to stop, like the coal mine owner.
  That is a multi-billion-dollar decision for the taxpayer. Right now
it is not in question. Until Dolan it was not in question. No one
assumed that if we said no more CFC's that we would have to go
out and pay every company in America to stop manufacturing
CFC's. The taxpayers, the press, the public, the Senators, including
me until recently, do not fully appreciate the phenomenal economic
consequence of taking a reading of the takings clause to its logical
                                      115
conclusion as espoused by Dolan, and shifting the burden of proof
and changing the standard.

  Now, can you articulate or think of any principled standard to
stop the movement announced in Dolan or Lucas? How does that
stop? How does this shifting of the burden not automatically take
you into the area that I worry most about, which is the one I have
just articulated? Is there a principled way in which to say, OK,
shifting the burden and requiring this relationship enunciated in
Dolan does not automatically lead to the concern I have stated in
the case I have just made up?

  Judge BREYER. I think the principal concern, as I listen to you,
Mr. Chairman, is the Justice Holmes' concern. As I listen to you,
what you are saying is think back to those columns in the coal
mine.

  The CHAIRMAN. Exactly.
  Judge BREYER. Are you really serious that it should impose that
the law should prevent people in a practical way, through their
Government, requiring columns that protect coal miners? And you
are saying, of course not. And as I hear that, I think you are saying
a law or an interpretation of the Constitution that would seriously
impede the coal columns that protect the miners and protect the
cities, that would be going too far. And I agree with you that that
is what Justice Holmes would have had in mind.
  That is why I think what the Court is trying to work out is, in
my own mind--I cannot read other people's minds, but it is what
is called a practical accommodation. Of course, there is a com-
pensation clause in the Constitution. Of course, property is given
some protection. At the same time, one must not go too far, and
what too far means is imposing significant practical obstacles. It
sounds to me
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me shift here, maybe, to another area.
Maybe we can come back to this. You and I are talking now about
the Constitution, the fifth amendment.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Another way to affect the basic rights of individ-
uals who do not have economic power is the way in which the
Court interprets statutes passed by the legislature and signed by
the President. And it is my view, I will say up front, that whether
courts grudgingly interpret the wishes of elected representatives or
interpret them in a generous way, obviously has significant impact.
  One of the things that has arisen in the last 10 years, particu-
larly the last 2 years, is this notion--mentioned by my distin-
guished colleague, who is, by the way, a fine lawyer and competent
to sit on the bench himself--his point made that sometimes the
cost of Government actions outweigh the benefits, economically.
And I said in my opening statement we often consciously make
those decisions to reflect public values, societal norms. We say we
know this costs a lot of money to do this, but we are not going to
put a value on human life; we are not going to put a dollar value
on a particular strongly felt societal value.
  Now, several years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency de-
cided to phase out the use of asbestos because it posed many health
risks, including the risk of cancer. A Federal appeals court reversed
the EPA's ban on asbestos in a case you discussed in your most re-
                                      116

cent book. The court decided that the statute under which the EPA
acted could not possibly have been intended to allow EPA's asbes-
tos ban because the ban cost so much money for every human life
it might save.

  Now, my question, Judge, is: Is it reasonable for a judge to infer
what Congress intended by looking at how much it costs to imple-
ment what Congress intended?

  Judge BREYER. YOU cannot answer the question never. It would
depend very much on what you had in mind in the statute.

  I wrote about that case in my book.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, I read your book.
  Judge BREYER. And I wrote really two opposite things about it,
absolutely opposite. The first thing I wrote about it is I thought
what was in the mind of the Court, and I thought what was in the
mind of the Court is they found an example where they thought
that EPA was imposing a ban that cost about a quarter of a billion
dollars. And it would save hardly anybody.
  The CHAIRMAN. But it would save somebody.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; it was like the number of people--they used
a kind of absurd example about the number of people who die from
toothpicks, eating toothpicks, or something like that. But that is
the first way I used it in the book, was to show that there are some
EPA regulations which, indeed, seem to be very expensive ways of
going about saving lives.
  The second way is the opposite way I used that case in the book,
because that case also provided an example of what you are sug-
gesting; that it is not very good for courts to get involved in making
that decision. That is more a decision for Congress to make. And
what I said when I discussed the case for the second time is look
how the judges, even if they have an example of what they think
is absolutely wrong, look what they have to do. They have to say
that there is a rule of law that prevents that, and the rule of law
that they enunciated in that case was a rule of law that said agen-
cies have to look at all the alternatives, or many of them, before
they do anything.
  But if you take that rule of law seriously, how can agencies have
the time to do all that kind of thing?
  The CHAIRMAN. AS a friend of mine at home says, "Bingo."
  Judge BREYER. Right. Well, you see, that is why the courts are
not the right ones to decide. I mean, I cannot say never, because
you can always think of an absurd case. You know, you can think
of something. There was one that Judge Wisdom wrote called aqua
slide, if you want to look at it sometime. But, I mean, you can find
sometime there is an absurd case. But I basically--
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me make sure I understand your, for
lack of a better phrase, rules of construction. If Congress delegates
to the EPA the authority to make a judgment about what is nec-
essary or reasonable to protect against a particular risk and not
delegate that to the Court, then doesn't the Court basically have
to show that the agency acted in a capricious manner?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, if Congress delegates authority to an agen-
cy to consider costs and benefits in implementing the statute, your
                                      117
view is, then, that the Court should, unless there is a clear dis-
regard of that requirement, yield to the agency.

  Judge BREYER. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I have much more to ask, but I will end
my round with this last point: What about the case where the Con-
gress is silent about considerations of costs and benefits, as we
often are? Under what circumstance may a court require an agency
to balance costs and benefits when Congress is silent?
  There is a friend of ours--and he is a friend of mine. I do not
want to mention his name, and the reason I do not want to men-
tion it is because I will do an injustice to his larger theory. But you
wrote in Southern California Law Review about the presumption
that one of your colleagues in the profession of teaching suggested,
which was that if the Congress is silent, the Court should presume
that the Congress intended the Court to make a cost-benefit analy-
sis. And you wrote in that article, you said, "Can the Court legally
adopt new up-to-date canons such as [this professor] has sug-
gested? Such modern canons favor the use of cost benefit analysis
in regulatory statutes, [among others,] but"--this is your quote--
"but can the Court simply adopt them? Where would it find the
legal authority for doing so?"
  My question is: Can it simply adopt such a canon?
  Judge BREYER. NO, not in my opinion.
  The CHAIRMAN. And where do those who suggest--your answer
is it cannot simply adopt them. But where do those who suggest
that it should find legal authority for doing so?
  Judge BREYER. I have to say that is a question better addressed
to them. The basic thing that I start out with, which I have written
and I certainly have no compunction about discussing anything I
have written, is as you suggest. What you suggest to me is that you
are talking about an area of substantive decisionmaking, not proce-
dure. You are talking about what is the best health policy? What
is the best safety policy? What is the best environmental policy?
  That is a question that you basically answer in Congress. And if
you don't say anything in the statute, normally what you do is you
delegate that authority to fill in the interstices to an agency. And
the agency's opinion in those matters is an opinion that the courts
must respect. They must do that, first for a legal reason. The power
flows from the people through article I of the Constitution to the
Congress and then to the agency. That is a legal reason that has
to do with democracy. And there is a second, very practical reason.
The very practical reason is, quite honestly, judges, who cannot
phone anyone, who have a lot of cases in their offices, who do not
have expertise in these areas, simply will not understand the basic
practicalities of how you deal with substantive environmental
health and safety policy, and, therefore, it is best that they let
those whom you have told to do it do the job.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, as you no doubt know, from a per-
sonal standpoint that answer pleases me very much. But I will
come back in my second round, which will be sometime next week,
I suspect--no, which will be sometime tomorrow, I hope--to discuss
what Professors Eskridge and Frickey refer to in their article on
statutory interpretation. What they both are worried about is that
the Courts' new canons of statutory interpretation, to quote them,
                                      118
"amount to a back-door version of the constitutional activism that
most Justices on the current Court have publicly denounced."

  Now, I would like to talk with you a little bit about that. I will
also discuss with you--and I will tell you ahead of time--the Pat-
terson case and Dellmuth v. Muth, where the Court seemed to have
used canons to reach the exact opposite conclusions. In Patterson,
there was a statute passed in the post-Civil War period that said
you cannot fail to hire someone merely because they are black. And
then in the 1960's, Congress came along and said we are going to
pass the Civil Rights Act. Then an action was brought. A person
was fired because she was black. She was hired, but then fired. She
said, "Wait a minute, that statute covers me." And the Court
looked down at the words of the statute and said: We do not find
any explicit reference to the 1964 statute, but we are going to infer
that Congress must have, when they passed that 1964 statute,
meant that it should cover it, not the Civil War statute.

  Then Dellmuth comes along, and Dellmuth is about a handi-
capped person, and a handicapped person being able to sue a State.
And when that person was denied equal access under the handi-
capped law, which the Senator from Utah and the Senator from
Massachusetts played a great role in passing, the Court looked
down at the statute and said, well, the 11th amendment basically
says there is a presumption against an individual suing a State in
Federal court. So since Congress did not mention explicitly that we
want to discount that presumption, we are going to assume they
meant let the presumption prevail.

  So they looked in one case at the statute and used a rule of con-
struction to find that Congress must have been talking about some-
thing that happened 100 years later, and in the second statute they
looked at the language and said, well, it did not mention the 11th
amendment so Congress must have meant that the 11th amend-
ment prevailed. The end result was the same. A black woman got
fired because she was black, and a handicapped child could not sue
the State of New York. The result was the same. People without
power got left out.

  Totally different rules of construction. I want to talk to you about
that, and a lot more. In the meantime, let's now take a break for
5 minutes, and then we will come back to Senator Hatch. I thank
you very much, Judge.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. While we are
waiting for the photographers to clear the well, I want the record
to show, so I do not get graded badly by Professor Heinzerling from
Georgetown, who is sitting behind me, that I do know that Ms. Pat-
terson was not fired; she alleged racial discrimination. And I just
want the record to show that, because I get graded by the visiting
professors who come and help us on this. So I just want the record
to reflect that.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, throughout your career, you have set forth what
can fairly be called a pragmatic, nonideological vision of the law.
In your own words, you said at one time:
                                      119

  Law itself is a human institution serving basic human or societal needs. It is
therefore properly subject to praise or to criticism in terms of certain pragmatic val-
ues, including both formal values, such as coherence and workability, and widely
shared substantive values, such as helping to achieve justice by interpreting the law
in accordance with the reasonable expectations of those to whom it applies.

  Now, I would like to explore what implications if any your prag-
matic vision of the law has for your understanding of the role of
a Supreme Court Justice. It is, after all, one thing to have a prag-
matic view of the law; it would be something quite different to be-
lieve that some or all actors in the legal system have a roving man-
date to pursue their individual visions of pragmatic justice.

  In your view, what constraints, formal or informal, legal or pru-
dential, really bind a Supreme Court Justice in his or her own deci-
sionmaking?

  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, I would start by saying this, and
I have said this before, and it is something that has considerable
significance to me. Why is it that judges wear black robes? I have
always thought that the reason that a judge wears a black robe is
to impress upon the people in the room that that particular judge
is not speaking as an individual. In an ideal world, the personality
of the judge, the face of the judge, would not be significant because
when the judge speaks with a black robe on, in no matter what
court, the judge is speaking for the law. And in an ideal world, the
law is the same irrespective of the personality of the judge.

  That is a very different thing. It is an absolutely true thing. But
it is consistent with believing that the law that the judge interprets
and enunciates with his black robe on is in fact a body of rules and
institutions and so forth that is supposed to work properly for peo-
ple.

  And so, remembering that, I would imagine that on the Supreme
Court, what I would be bound by is the words, the history, the
precedents, the traditions, all of those things which in fact go up
to make this great body of institutions, including legal advice and
how businesses and labor unions interpret it and so forth, that we
call law.

  The role of the subjective preference of the judge is not supposed
to be relevant, and while no one can escape from his own back-
ground, from his own opinions, from his own personality, et cetera,
Learned Hand once described in fact, at a speech given to com-
memorate Justice Cardozo, he described the judge as a runner,
stripped for the race. He may have been quoting Holmes then. But
in his view, what that meant was to the best ability, a judge should
be dispassionate and try to remember that what he is trying to do
is interpret the law that applies to everyone, not enunciate a sub-
jective belief or preference.

  Senator HATCH. Would you agree, then, that a judge's authority
derives entirely from the fact that he or she is applying the law,
not simply imposing his or her policy preferences?

  Judge BREYER. Of course, that is true. And why it is difficult, in
an important court like the Supreme Court, is of course people dis-
agree, often, about how, in vast, uncertain, open areas of law,
where there are such good arguments on both sides of such impor-
tant policy issues, of course people disagree about what the proper
outcome of those issues is. But in trying to find the correct solu-
tion, the helpful solution consistent with the underlying human

       85-742 - 95 - 5
                                      120
purpose, the judge follows canons, practices, rules, cases, proce-
dures, all those things that help define the role of the judge, which
is the same for judge A as it is for judge B.

  Senator HATCH. Would you agree, then, that the meaning of the
law is to be ascertained according to the understanding of the law
when it was enacted?

  Judge BREYER. Almost always. Almost always.
  Senator HATCH. Can you think of any situation
  Judge BREYER. The reason that I hesitate a little is because of
course, there are instances, particularly with the Constitution and
other places, where it is so open and unclear as to just how the
Framers or the authors intended it.
  Senator HATCH. And I accept that. Would you also agree that
separation of powers concerns mandate that courts be careful not
to intrude on the terrain of the various political branches?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. All right. Those are important issues to me and
I think to everybody who understands or is concerned with con-
stitutional law.
  Judge Breyer, as you know, the first liberty protected in the Bill
of Rights is religious liberty. Specifically, the free exercise clause
of the first amendment provides that Government shall make no
law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.
  In its 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Su-
preme Court held" that a neutral, generally applicable law need not
be justified by a compelling interest even if the law has the inci-
dental effect of severely burdening a particular religious practice.
And as you may know, I was very concerned that in the aftermath
of the Smith case, the freedoms of religious minorities in this coun-
try were vulnerable to hostile majorities. For this reason, I was the
lead sponsor along with Senator Kennedy in enacting the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, which became law last year and which
restored the compelling interest standard that was widely under-
stood to be in force before the Smith case.
  I would like to ask you about an opinion that you wrote before
the Smith case was decided, and that was New Life Baptist Church
Academy v. Town of East Longmeadow, back in 1989.
  You ruled that a local school committee's proposed procedures for
reviewing the adequacy of the secular education provided to stu-
dents at a Fundamental Baptist Church school did not violate the
free exercise clause. And as you know, your ruling in this case has
been criticized as not sufficiently protective of religious liberty.
  How would you respond to those criticisms about your decision
in that case? Both Senator Kennedy and I are watching you very
carefully.
  Judge BREYER. SO is Chloe. Chloe was out last summer in Los
Angeles. She was working with a minority religious group, the
Vietnamese Buddhists, and they were actually having a very prac-
tical problem, because they were trying to set up home temples in
areas of the city where the rules and regulations had made it tough
for them, and the question was could you work that out in a way
that both satisfied the needs of the city and also allowed these peo-
ple to practice their religion. That was terribly important. So she
is also very interested in that.
                                      121
  Senator HATCH. Well, good for you, Chloe. When we enacted the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act, we were strongly supportive of
protecting religious liberty and freedom.
  Judge BREYER. Of course.
  Senator HATCH. Go ahead.
  Judge BREYER. Of course, and the particular case, I found ex-
tremely difficult. Why? I will tell you a little bit about it. If you go
back into the Constitution, even free speech, I read recently it real-
ly descends historically from the need to protect religion. There is
nothing more important to a person or to that person's family than
a religious principle, and there is nothing more important to a fam-
ily that has those principles than to be able to pass those principles
and beliefs on to the next generation.
  That is why schools are so important in this area. That is why
people feel so strongly about schooling. So one starts with the real-
ization that what was at issue in the first amendment, I think both
for speech and for religion, was a decision made sometime around
the 17th century, that it is about time to stop killing each other
because of religious beliefs, and what we are going to do is respect
the religion of each other, and people are going to be free to prac-
tice that religion and to pass it on to their families. They are going
to teach their children, and their children can teach their children.
That is absolutely basic.
  Senator HATCH. Well, as you know
  Judge BREYER. The opposite side of the coin is that, of course,
the people, as organized in government, have an interest to see
that you or I or any other family do not abuse our children, and
they have an interest in seeing that our children, each other's chil-
dren, do receive some kind of education--that they learn how to
read, they learn how to write, they learn mathematics--and for
that reason, it is absolutely well-established that although people
can teach their children at home if they wish, because of the need
to pass on their religion, it is equally well-established that the
State has some interest in seeing that education is going on and
that the children are being taught.
  Now, in that particular case, it was a little unusual because the
argument came up--and I read through that record with pretty
great care--and what had gone on, I think, was everyone in the
State said they could teach their children at home, that particular
religious group. There were some complaints about the quality of
the education--they had a special school--and everybody agreed
that the school system could go in and look and see what was being
done.
  Indeed, the religious school itself had said at one point, We do
not mind if you come in and look; what we do not want to do is
we do not want to acknowledge the school board, because we be-
lieve there is no higher authority than God. And the school board,
making an effort to accommodate, had said, Do not acknowledge
us; we do not want you to acknowledge us. Just let us look and see
what is happening, the same way as you might any visitor at all.
And then the school had said, Yes, that is OK. But somehow in the
legal argument in the lower court, that became a little confused,
and before you know it, what had happened was that the lower
court had entered a decree which said the way to go about this,
                                      122
State, is to test the children after they leave school; while the State
had said, no, no, it is better to go in and see.

  Now, there, the question was does the Constitution require after-
school testing, or does it require visits, or is it up to the State? And
that is a rather narrow point, and what we held in the case, unani-
mously, was that the Constitution does not require after-school
testing; if the State wants to do it that way, they could. But you
see, some people might think that was more restrictive; others
might think it was less restrictive. In other words, it was a fairly
narrow technical matter growing out of the record.

  Senator HATCH. I just hope that you and other members of the
judicial community will recognize these important issues, and I
think you do--and certainly recognize the importance of the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act

  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. And the overwhelming vote that it
had in both Houses of Congress.
  Judge BREYER. The principle is absolutely right.
  Senator HATCH. Congress intended to give strong protections to
religious belief and liberty.
  Judge BREYER. Right.
  Senator HATCH. Unfortunately, just recently, in a case involving
an order to a church to return tithes made in good faith by church-
goers who later became bankrupt, we have the current administra-
tion, despite its support for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
interpreting the act in a manner that would effectively gut it, in
my opinion.
  Now, I am not asking for your views on that case, because un-
doubtedly, that is going to come before the Court; but I hope that
all of you will consider this particular act and its importance, and
that religious freedom is the first of the mentioned liberties in the
Bill of Rights. And I hope you will consider the overwhelming con-
gressional intent with regard to that.
  The establishment clause of the first amendment provides that
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of reli-
gion. Under the test devised by the Supreme Court in 1971, the
Lemon v. Kurtzman case, a practice satisfies the establishment
clause only if it, first, reflects a clearly secular purpose; second, has
a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and
third, effectively avoids an excessive entanglement with religion.
  Now, I am very concerned that this abstract, arid, and ahistorical
test is often applied in a manner that is insensitive to practices
that are part and parcel of our political and cultural heritage. In
particular, narrow reliance on the Lemon test ignores a richer
strain of Supreme Court precedent that recognizes that interpreta-
tion of the establishment clause should comport with what history
reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its guarantees.
  In Justice Brennan's words, "the existence from the beginning of
the Nation's life of a practice * * * is a fact of considerable import
in the interpretation" of the establishment clause.
  Now, do you agree or disagree that the historical pedigree of a
practice should be given considerable weight in the determination
of whether a practice amounts to an establishment of religion? You
                                      123
mentioned that historical precedent is important to you. Do you
feel it is important in this instance?

  Judge BREYER. It is important; there is no question it is impor-
tant. The establishment clause has tremendous foresight, tremen-
dous foresight, I think. The simple model--there is always in my
mind, like, two or three fairly simple things--I think of the estab-
lishment clause, I think of Jefferson, and I think of a wall. And the
reason that there was that wall, the reason, which has become so
much more important perhaps even now than it was then, is that
we are a country of so many different people, of so many different
religions, and it is so terribly important to members of each reli-
gion to be able to practice that religion freely, to be able to pass
that religion on to their children. And each religion in a country
of many, many different religions would not want the State to side
with some other religion, so each must be concerned that the State
remain neutral.

  Then, there are also cases arising. And when cases arise with
secular institutions, the question becomes have you injected too
much religion into them. You can inject some--I mean, you have
chaplains in Congress. Schools--what about schools? You see teach-
ing your own children--it becomes very important not to, in a secu-
lar school, inject much religion into a school.

  What of the other side of the wall? Can the State aid religion?
The answer is certainly, sometimes. Nobody thinks--nobody
thinks--that you are not going to send the fire brigade if the
church catches fire. Nobody thinks that the church does not have
the advantage of public services. The question becomes when is it
too much. And again, schools are critically important because of the
importance of schools to religious people.

  So that is the framework that I use, and in trying to decide
whether and when, what is too much, of course you look at history,
and you look at tradition, and you look at the current world as we
live it in the United States.

  Senator HATCH. At one time, you stated that, "Of course, the wall
between church and State is not absolute."

  Judge BREYER. NO; no one is going to say--to use an extreme ex-
ample--no one would say that if the church is on fire, do not send
the fire department. No one would say that the public services of
a city are not available to the church. The question becomes when
have you gone too far in terms of trying to preserve a country of
many different religions where Government is basically neutral as
among them.

  Those are very difficult questions.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I think, as we have seen up here on Cap-
itol Hill, the word "wall" of separation is a metaphor
  Judge BREYER. Yes, absolutely. That is true.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. And it leads to a lot of hostility.
  Judge BREYER. Right.
  Senator HATCH. And there has to be some reason brought into
the system.
  Judge BREYER. There is.
  Senator HATCH. In Lee v. Weisman back in 1992, the Supreme
Court, relying on Warren Court rulings, held by a 5-to-4 vote that
a school district violated the establishment clause when it invited
                                      124
a rabbi to lead a prayer at a school graduation. Now, in my view,
we have reached new depths when a nonsectarian prayer by a
rabbi at a school graduation ceremony is censored by the establish-
ment clause.

  Notwithstanding the fact-specific language of the Court's opinion
in Lee, some have since tried to portray Lee as having invalidated
all prayer at school graduation ceremonies including, for example,
nonsectarian student-led prayer.

  Would you consider it a relevant factor for purposes of the estab-
lishment clause whether it is a member of the clergy or a student
who leads the prayer?

  Judge BREYER. That is very specific, and I
  Senator HATCH. I am not asking you if the factor would be dis-
positive, but simply whether it would be relevant.
  Judge BREYER. It sounds as if it is--as you said, it sounds as if
it is a relevant factor. And I understand the point and agree that
it is not absolute, these things, and I do think--it sounds as if it
would be a relevant factor.
  Senator HATCH. Would you consider it relevant whether the deci-
sion to have prayer at a graduation was made by school officials
or students?
  Judge BREYER. Well, you bring up matters, Senator, which sound
as if they are relevant.
  Senator HATCH. I think that is good.
  Judge BREYER. Would you repeat that, what was good?
  Senator HATCH. I say that is good, his discussion of that.
  Judge Breyer, let me turn to the matter of copyright briefly, and
on a subject upon which you have written.
  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator HATCH. I am sure you know what I am going to ask. In
1970, you wrote a Law Review article entitled '"The Uneasy Case
for Copyright." It was considered quite controversial in many quar-
ters because it questioned many of the basic assumptions upon
which copyright law had long been based. In addition, you strongly
argued against extending copyright to what were then new areas
of protection, such as computer programs, but that was nearly 25
years ago.
  Since 1970, our copyright laws, of course, have been fundamen-
tally altered, first by the adoption of the landmark 1976 Copyright
Act, which greatly strengthened Federal copyright, extending it
even to unpublished works; second, by the 1980 statutory recogni-
tion of the copyright-protected status of computer software and
data bases; and, finally, by the 1988 U.S. ratification of the Berne
Convention for the protection of literary and artistic property,
which is the principal international copyright treaty.
  Now, have your views on copyright changed since 1970? [Laugh-
ter.]
  Judge BREYER. Senator, the reason I laugh
  Senator HATCH. HOW can you get a bigger home-run ball than
that?
  Judge BREYER. The reason I laugh is that that article was aw-
fully important to me, because what turned on that article for me
was a job. The question was whether I would get tenure, so I put
quite a lot of effort into that article.
                                      125
  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Judge BREYER. AS you point out, Congress has passed a statute
since then. The law has changed since then. I certainly would fol-
low the statute rather than views, but I cannot resist saying this:
that recently I did reread that section on the computer part, and
what I thought at that time years ago--it was 25 years ago--I
think a lot of the computer people thought that what we would all
be doing is we would have like a big electricity plant or something
in the middle of the city and everybody would be hooked up to this
thing with wires, and you would have the terminal that went up
to this big computer utility. And then, if that had been so, I said,
well, you do not really necessarily need copyright to protect the
program because the guy owning the utility, which would probably
be regulated, could just charge. You would come to the same thing.
  Then I put in a paragraph and said, you know, it would be dif-
ferent if what happened would be that everybody would have his
own little computer, and the programs would be made by 100 or
1,000 different companies, and they would sell them off the shelf,
and it would be really easy to copy them. And then I do not know
what we would do.
  So I do not know that I have to change that view because it
was
  Senator HATCH. OK. With regard to the takings clause, I have
to say that I find it most curious that our chairman is very protec-
tive of rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution, as are
many on this committee, yet is, I hate to say it, Joe, somewhat dis-
dainful of rights that are specifically mentioned in the Constitu-
tion. And I am very concerned, as are all Westerners and I think
people all over the country, about the unlawful taking of property,
whether by whole or by part, by Government and Government reg-
ulation, and taking it without just compensation. So those are mat-
ters that I just want to reemphasize a lot of us are concerned about
on the other side of that issue even though I think the chairman
makes some good points otherwise.
  Various doctrines of justiciability, for example, standing, ripe-
ness, and mootness, operate to help confine the Federal courts
within our constitutional scheme of separation of powers, the adju-
dication of live claims raised by parties who have suffered concrete
and particularized injuries that can be readdressed.
  If these elements are diluted, the judicial power is expanded at
the expense of the executive and legislative branches. Are you in
agreement with the current Supreme Court case law in standing,
ripeness, and mootness? And if not, what are your areas of dis-
agreement?
  Judge BREYER. The basic principles arise really out of article III.
Article III of the Constitution says the judicial powers shall extend
to all cases. It talks about cases, and it talks about controversies.
And some of the rules that you mention are really designed to
make certain that the courts decide real .cases and real controver-
sies. I think that those are principles that people agree upon.
  I think there is another principle that they agree upon, and that
is when you in Congress pass a statute, there are certain groups
of people whom that statute means to protect. And there are also
                                      126
a lot of people, when your statute is unclear in this respect, that
might argue their way into protection.

  Now, any of those people, if they are really hurt, should be able
to bring a lawsuit, because those are people that you mean to pro-
tect, or at least arguably you mean to protect them, from the very
kind of injury that you are worried about in that statute. I think
most people would agree with that.

  Then there are areas of what I would call gray areas in the law
about whether the Court is pushing a little bit more this way or
a little bit more that way in respect to how we go about making
a little more concrete what I have just said generally. On those
matters, I think I should like to reserve judgment, because I think
that those are matters that are very much at issue in Supreme
Court cases.

  Senator HATCH. I thank you. I notice that my time has just about
expired, but I appreciate your answers. I have really enjoyed listen-
ing to you.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, the Preamble to the Constitution makes it clear
the purpose of our system of law is to enhance the lives of every
American; in the Framers' words, "to secure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity." And at the White House ceremony,
when you were nominated, you said quite eloquently that your goal
as a Justice was to help make the Constitution and laws work for
real people. So I would like to discuss with you several areas where
your work made an impact on real people, on the rights of working
women, on the safety of medications, on the quality of our environ-
ment, and also on the security of Americans from the threat of
crime in our homes and on the streets in our communities.
  Let's begin with the area of gender discrimination on the job, and
one of your decisions, in particular, is a classic case involving two
working women in the town of Peabody, MA, which illustrates
what the law can mean in real human terms to the people in-
volved. The case I am referring to is Stathos v. Bowden.
  The plaintiffs, Stella Stathos and Gloria Bailey, worked in cleri-
cal jobs at the Peabody Municipal Lighting Commission. Both
women devoted their entire working lives to the city agency, start-
ing when they finished high school and continuing until they
reached the retirement age. Ms. Stathos worked there 36 years be-
fore she retired in 1985; Mrs. Bailey worked there 41 years until
she retired just last year.
  In 1977, the Lighting Commission reorganized the plant where
the women worked and drew up an organization chart which made
it clear for the first time that men holding the positions equivalent
to those held by Ms. Stathos and Mrs. Bailey were being paid
about $12,000 more than the two women were receiving, and the
women repeatedly asked for a pay increase to eliminate the dispar-
ity, and their requests were denied. They filed suit under two Fed-
eral antidiscrimination laws, and I am sure it took a lot of courage
to sue their employer. It really was fighting city hall then. But in
the end, they prevailed, and they won a jury verdict in their favor,
                                      127
requiring the employer to raise their pay and pay them damages.
And when the city appealed, you wrote an opinion upholding the
trial court on several points of law and affirmed the award.

  One line in your opinion seems to me to be particularly revealing
on how you viewed the case. The defendants had argued that they
were entitled to upset the verdict because the jury had not been
asked to consider whether the defendants had acted in good faith.
And in rejecting the claim, you wrote, and I quote, "We do not see
how anyone could think that paying women less just because they
were women would not constitute unlawful discrimination."

  Can you tell us how this case is a reflection of your attitude to-
ward equality, equal opportunity for women, and about your ap-
proach in interpreting the laws against sex discrimination?

  Judge BREYER. Some things seem fairly obvious to me, Senator,
and I think that was one of them. I suppose I was restrained in
that. I guess it is fairly obvious, isn't it, that you are not going to
pay a woman less for doing the same job as a man? What is very
easy to me is I think of Chloe and I think of Nell, and they are
going to be in the workplace. And, my goodness, I should come
back and somebody should have to tell somebody that a woman is
going to make less money for doing the same thing or is going to
have some other onerous condition that a man would not have?

  I mean, you try to explain that to Chloe or to Nell or to any other
woman in the workplace. There is no explanation. And I would
think in 1994 that that is rather clear to people. I would think it
is rather difficult to make a defense saying, oh, dear, I did not
know that. What else is there to say?

  You see, I start with certain things that I assume is fairly obvi-
ous.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think there are many of us that would
certainly agree with both your analysis and conclusion, but I think
we also understand the reality in terms of the American workforce
that too often that is not the case, and it is a real issue that is out
there. Your response to that injustice I think was very well re-
ceived.

  I took the opportunity to call last night, I called Stella Stathos
and Gloria Bailey, who still live up there in Peabody, and they said
interesting things. They told us that after they won the case, the
Lighting Commission accepted the outcome and showed them no
animosity, which I thought was somewhat hopeful. And they also
told me how proud they are that their case may open up the doors
for other women in the same situation.

  I asked each of them what they thought about you, which is
rather an opening, and Mrs. Bailey said, "Did he ever do it the
right way." And Mrs. Stathos said, "He really stood up for all of
us," and I think that says it all.

  You have been one of the leading scholarly commentators on ad-
ministrative law and regulations, and while obviously these subject
matters seem dry and arcane, they can be of enormous importance
to every American. Americans have a right to expect that the food
they eat and the water they drink and the medications they take
and the air they breathe and the place where they work will be
safe and free from dangerous substances or machinery. Congress
passes the laws that set the broad standards in these and other
                                      128

areas, but it is up to the administrative agencies like the EPA and
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the FDA
to adopt the regulations that spell out the standards to apply them
in particular situations to protect health and safety.

  This is an important work of administrative agencies, and a
great deal has been written about your views on these subjects.
Most of what has been written has been complimentary, but I
would like to give you the opportunity to respond to some of the
rest.

  My question is: How do you respond to the suggestion some have
made that you are hostile to the health and safety regulations?

  Judge BREYER. I have said in my book that I think regulation is
necessary in those areas. I guess if you wanted a simple statement,
a simple statement, I wrote a book review not too long ago in which
I tried--because it was written about the economics of AIDS. And
I wanted to explain in that book what I saw as an important dif-
ference, as you have said, actually, an important difference be-
tween what you might call classical economic regulation, like air-
lines or trucks, and the regulation involving health, safety, and the
environment.

  I said as to the first, trucking, airlines, it is not really surprising
that economics may help. It is not the whole story, but it tells a
significant amount of the story because our object there is to get
low prices for consumers. And maybe economics can help us.

  When you start talking about health, safety, and the environ-
ment, the role is much more limited because, there, no one would
think that economics is going to tell you how you ought to spend
helping the life of another person. If, in fact, people want to spend
a lot of money to help save earthquake victims in California, who
could say that was wrong? And what I ended up there saying is
that in this kind of area, it is probably John Donne, the poet, who
has more to tell us about what to do than Adam Smith, the econo-
mist. That is a decision for Congress to make reflecting the values
of people.

  So I tried to draw that distinction, and that does not mean all
those areas work perfectly either. Everyone can have a lot of criti-
cisms about every area, but, nonetheless, there is a difference in
the way economics feeds into the enterprise. And that is what I
have tried to spell out in that review.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, in two of the areas--one in the area of
FDA and the other in the environment--you have not written
many decisions on the FDA, but there is one that in particular you
decided, U.S. v. 50 Boxes More or Less. You voted to uphold the
FDA's right to seize prescription drugs because the manufacturer
had not presented adequate and well-controlled studies to dem-
onstrate its safety and effectiveness and the conditions for which
it would be prescribed.

  What is significant about your opinion in this case is that you
upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment to the FDA,
even though the drug in question has successfully been on the mar-
ket 35 years. But the manufacturer had not met the strict regu-
latory standards for proving the safety and effectiveness of the
drug, and you upheld the drug seizure by the FDA.
                                      129
  It seems to me that that opinion could hardly have been written
by someone who is hostile to health and safety regulations. My
question is: Would you spell out the reasons for reaching that deci-
sion?
  Judge BREYER. That decision reflected an administrative agency's
rules and regulations that had evolved slowly over time. Those
rules and regulations followed from a statute that Congress en-
acted. They might not have been perfect, but basically it was the
administrative agency's job and the courts over time had ratified
that job to work out a system that would remove dangerous drugs
from the market.
  The particular drug in question fell within that system, and I
thought there--and I think now, and I think the law reflects that--
that it is risky for courts to start monkeying around with a case-
by-case deviation from a regulatory system that has been thought-
fully worked out over the years. You cannot say never with any-
thing. But you have to remember that the basic statute designed
to protect people has been worked out in Congress, delegated to the
agency, and when that works fairly well over the course of time,
it is not surprising that the law says follow what the agency says.
That is what I think was basically going on there.
  Senator KENNEDY. Your opinions in the environmental cases
have earned high marks from the environmentalists in New Eng-
land. One was very important in Massachusetts involving George's
Bank, which is one of the most productive fishing areas. You
upheld a district court ruling that former Interior Secretary James
Watt could not auction off the rights to drill for oil in that fishing
area because the Interior Department had not done an adequate
environmental impact statement on the effect of drilling on those
important fisheries.
  Could you tell us about that decision and how generally your ra-
tionale basically would reflect your approach on environmental reg-
ulation?
  Judge BREYER. I think that decision, again, reflects the need for
courts to go back to the underlying intent of Congress, and I think
it reflects our own court's view of what that intent was in respect
to environmental impact statements. Basically, there had been an
environmental impact statement that was going to permit--the In-
terior Department wanted to drill for oil off George's Bank. But be-
tween the time they first looked at it and the time it came up to
our court, everybody had changed his mind about how much oil
was likely to be there. They first thought billions of barrels. They
second thought hardly any.
  The question was: Do they have to go prepare a new environ-
mental impact statement if they still want to drill? They did still
want to drill. Our court said if you do, you better prepare a new
statement. Why? Because there has been such a big change. You
might want to hurt the environment if you are going to get billions
of barrels, but, really, do you really want to hurt the environment
for a little bit?
  Now, what had been argued on the other side of that case was:
Well, we will do the statement; just let us go forward with our auc-
tion in the meantime. But we said no, that is not the purpose of
the environmental impact statement. The purpose of that state-
                                      130

ment is to make this great bureaucracy think about this hard be-
fore the gears start in motion.

  So do not go let out the bids and everything and then write the
statement, because once the agency is committed to the action, it
is too late to write statements.

  The very purpose of the law, to protect the environment in this
area, is to get the statement written before the agency becomes bu-
reaucratically committed to a course of action that could hurt the
environment. And that is what was going on in that opinion.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is a good example of how sound envi-
ronmental regulation can protect the public interest.

  I would like to introduce into the record a letter, Mr. Chairman,
from Douglas Foy, who is the executive director of the Conservation
Law Foundation, certainly the leading public interest environ-
mental law group in New England. Mr. Foy writes in part:

  Stephen Breyer has fashioned a remarkable record on environmental matters that
have come before the First Circuit Court of Appeals. His opinions reflect an unusual
sensitivity to natural resource concerns, whether in matters involving air and water
pollution, off-shore oil and gas drilling, the clean-up of Boston Harbor, or protection
of the Cape Cod National Seashore.

  Judge Breyer brings a New Englander's common sense to natural resource mat-
ters, and couples that common sense with an impressive understanding of adminis-
trative procedure and agency foibles. My only regret is that Judge Breyer cannot
sit on the Supreme Court and the First Circuit at the same time.

  To which I can add that the first circuit's loss is the Nation's
gain.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

                                                            CONSERVATION LAW FOUNDATION,

                                                                  Boston, MA, June 30, 1994.
  To WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Stephen Breyer has fashioned a remarkable record
on environmental matters that have come before the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
His opinions reflect an unusual sensitivity to natural resource concerns, whether in
matters involving air and water pollution, off-shore oil and gas drilling, the clean-
up of Boston Harbor, or protection of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The Court's
line of decisions on the obligations imposed by NEPA are leading precedents, reflect-
ing a penetrating understanding of the law's requirements and of agencies' cavalier
efforts to avoid its application.
  Judge Breyer brings a New Englander's common sense to natural resource mat-
ters, and couples that common sense with an impressive understanding of adminis-
trative procedure and agency foibles. Much of the development of environmental law
in the next decade will revolve around the application and enforcement of pivotal
federal laws (such as the Clean Air Act, National Energy Act, Magnuson Act, and
ISTEA), by agencies, in the states and regions. Stephen Breyer is precisely the kind
of judge to whom we should entrust review of agency compliance with those laws.
My only regret is that Judge Breyer cannot sit on the Supreme Court and the First
Circuit at the same time.

        Sincerely,

                                                                                       DOUGLAS I. FOY,

                                                                             Executive Director.

  Senator KENNEDY. Turning to another area involving the crimi-
nal justice system, as you know, Senator Thurmond and I worked
for many years with Chairman Biden to pass the Sentencing Re-
form Act of 1984, the law that abolished the Federal parole and
created a sentencing guidelines system in the Federal courts. And
with all the talk about truth in sentencing, it is important to re-
member that we created truth in sentencing at the Federal level
10 years ago.
                                      131
  Before that time, the sentencing system was a matter of law
without order; judges in two different courtrooms sentencing two
equally culpable defendants might hand down two completely dif-
ferent sentences. One defendant might get 10 years, another might
get probation, and there was nothing the prosecutors could do
about it. And because of parole, the sentence imposed by the judge
had little to do with the time the defendant actually served, and
many criminals served only a third of their sentences even in cases
involving violent crimes.
  This system led people to lose faith in the ability of the legal sys-
tem to do justice and protect the interests of victims of crime. So
we abolished parole in the Federal system and created a commis-
sion to write sentencing guidelines so that criminals who commit
similar crimes will get similar sentences and actually serve the
time they get.
  You served as one of the first members of the commission. You
helped forge the key agreements that got the job done. These
guidelines provide for tough, no-nonsense sentences, increasing the
time served by violent criminals and by white-collar corporate
criminals who used to get special treatment in the Federal courts.
  Could you briefly describe how the guideline system achieves
truth in sentencing and why you think that truth in sentencing is
an important goal.
  Judge BREYER. I think that you decided, Senator, and the other
Senators on this committee decided, at that time correctly, that the
public was very confused about sentencing. A judge would sentence
a robber to 6 years in jail, but the robber would be out after 2.
Sometimes, the judge would sentence him to 18 years for a violent
robbery, and he would be out after 6. Sometimes, the judge would
sentence him to 8, and he would not be out until after 7. No one
knew what in fact was happening, and the public's cynicism grew.
  Therefore, you and this committee and the Congress decided that
under the new Federal sentencing system, the sentence given by
the judge would be the sentence that was served--not completely;
there is 15 percent good time that could be awarded--but basically,
the sentence given would be the sentence served, and that is what
has happened.
  The second basic objective that you had, which I think still is a
worthy objective, I could describe like this: Many judges in the first
circuit have a lot of experience in sentencing, and they do it well.
Judge Toro, the chief judge in Massachusetts, across the hall, for
many years would describe to me how he sentenced people, and it
seemed very sensible. But then, a different judge in Los Angeles,
let us say, an equally good judge, an outstanding judge, would sen-
tence the same kind of person for the same kind of crime, and the
results would be dramatically different.
  So what you said is that the sentence should not depend on who
the judge is. In New York, they would have a wheel and assign
judges by lottery. Well, why would you need a wheel, unless people
thought that the personality of the judge was playing a role in the
sentence? Well, that should not be. And so you set up the Sentenc-
ing Commission to try to even that out. That is a hard job.
  I think the Sentencing Commission has come up with guidelines
that do tend to even that out. The basic philosophy of the statute,
                                      132
the basic philosophy of the guidelines, is that they will write guide-
lines that apply to specific types of crimes and specific types of
criminals, and judge, when you are sentencing a person for a par-
ticular kind of crime, a particular kind of person, you follow the
guidelines. That gives you very little leeway--if you have an ordi-
nary case. Judge, if you have an unusual case, you may depart
from the guidelines. Use your own judgment there. But you have
to give your reason, and it will be reviewable in a court of appeals.

  Now, that is the basic theory. Guidelines, I know, are controver-
sial. I know that these guidelines have not worked perfectly. But
it does seem to me to be a step in the right direction toward more
uniform justice and toward more uniform justice and toward more
understandable justice so that people will understand that punish-
ments are uniformly applied, and the punishment announced is the
punishment that will be given.

  Senator KENNEDY. DO you want to add anything with regard to
whether the mandatory minimums have been additive and useful
and helpful?

  Judge BREYER. Well, what I have said publicly, Senator
  Senator KENNEDY. I was going to keep you out of controversy
until that one.
  Judge BREYER. This is a legislative matter. This is a legislative
matter, and I think that Congress will in its wisdom determine
that political matter. I have expressed in my writings sometimes
some criticism of that.
  Senator KENNEDY. I will include that excellent article as part of
the record.

  Senator KENNEDY. My time is almost up, Judge Breyer, but I
want to offer a brief comment about your extraordinary career of
public service, and that is that throughout your life, you have dedi-
cated yourself to the public interest. You have served as a law clerk
to Justice Goldberg; from there, you went to the Justice Depart-
ment, where you developed creative ways to use the antitrust laws
and fight housing discrimination. When you became a professor at
Harvard Law School, you did not retreat into an ivory tower; you
focused on the tough problems of economic regulation and making
government work better. And whenever the call to public service
was heard, you answered, helping Archibald Cox to investigate Wa-
tergate, helping the Senate address complex regulatory matters,
and serving with great distinction as chief counsel of this commit-
tee.

  And when you became an appeals court judge, your commitment
to the administration of justice did not stop there; you took on the
different task of adopting tough, fair sentencing guidelines, and
you continued to teach law to young people and to analyze the
toughest problems of the day.

  That kind of work is not glamorous. It does not get you a lot of
publicity or honors. But it is the kind of work that helps real peo-
ple, and it is the kind of work that will make you a first-rate Jus-
tice on the Supreme Court, where you will enhance the lives of
Americans for years to come.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. It is also the kind of work
that allows me as chairman to get some of the first-rate minds like
the two professors sitting behind me to come and work for little or
nothing because people like you end up on the Supreme Court. So
I thank you for that, for saving the taxpayers a lot of money by
getting first-rate staffpersons to take cuts in salaries to come and
work with us.
  Judge, I thank you for this morning, and as I indicated, what we
will do now, since we have a very important vote that will take
place on the floor of the Senate at 2:30, we will wait and reconvene
at 2:45, at which time, the first order of questioning will be Senator
Thurmond and then Senator Metzenbaum.
  We are recessed until 2:45.
  [Whereupon, at 12:56 p.m., the committee was recessed, to recon-
vene at 2:45 p.m. this same day.]

                            AFTERNOON SESSION [2:58 P.M.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back, Judge.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We now turn to the senior member of this com-
mittee, our one and only chairman, Senator Thurmond.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STROM THURMOND, A U.S.
        SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, we are glad to have you with us.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
                                      135
  Senator THURMOND. I am glad to see your fine family here with
you.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Today, the Judiciary Committee begins
hearings to consider the nomination of Judge Stephen Breyer to be
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
  If confirmed, Judge Breyer would be the 108th person to serve
as a Justice and is the 26th Supreme Court nominee which I have
been privileged to review during my service in the Senate.
  A Justice on the Supreme Court occupies a life-tenured position
of immense power. As members of the Judiciary Committee, we
have a responsibility to our Senate colleagues and to the American
people to closely examine Judge Breyer's qualifications. It is our
solemn duty to ensure that a nominee to the Supreme Court pos-
sesses the necessary qualifications to serve on the most important
and prestigious Court in America.
  Over the years, I have determined the special criteria which I be-
lieve an individual must possess to serve on the Supreme Court,
and they are as follows:
  First, unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be honest, abso-
lutely incorruptible, and completely fair.
  Second, courage. A nominee must possess the courage to make
decisions on difficult issues according to the laws and the Constitu-
tion.
  Third, compassion. While a nominee must be firm in his or her
decisions, mercy should be shown when appropriate.
  Fourth, professional competence. The nominee must have mas-
tered the complexity of the law.
  Fifth, proper judicial temperament. The nominee must have the
self-discipline to prevent the pressures of the moment from disrupt-
ing the composure of a well-ordered mind, and be courteous to the
lawyers, litigants, and court personnel.
  Sixth, an understanding of and appreciation for the majesty of
our system of Government--its separation of powers between the
branches of our Federal Government; its division of powers be-
tween the Federal and State governments; and the reservation to
the States and to the people of all powers not delegated to the Fed-
eral Government.
  Mr. Chairman, I have known Judge Breyer and followed his ca-
reer for 20 years, since his first days as special counsel on the Ad-
ministrative Practices Subcommittee. Of course, he later served as
chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee and was most co-
operative in that role.
  Since December 1980, Judge Breyer has served with distinction
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and as chief
judge of that circuit since 1990.
  In 1985, then-President Reagan appointed Judge Breyer as one
of the three judge-members of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a
post he held until the expiration of his term at the end of October
1989. Under the very able, continuing leadership of its chairman,
Judge William W. Wilkins, Jr., of South Carolina, the Sentencing
Commission accomplished on schedule the formidable task of devis-
ing a workable set of guidelines to govern the imposition of sen-
tences for Federal crimes.
                                      136
  I was pleased to coauthor the law which created the Sentencing
Commission, along with Senators Kennedy, Biden, Hatch, and oth-
ers. Judge Breyer is the type of individual who we envision would
serve on the Commission to make our goal of effective sentencing
reform a successful reality. In this regard, Judge Wilkins and oth-
ers have told me of the invaluable contributions Judge Breyer
made in assisting with drafting the initial guidelines and in help-
ing to explain them to others, particularly to Federal judges who
must interpret and apply them.
  Sentences now imposed under the guidelines are fairer, more
uniform, and certain. They are also tougher in the areas of violent
crime, major white-collar crime, and major drug offenses--areas
where past sentencing practices often were too lenient.
  Mr. Chairman, Judge Breyer has come a long way from the sum-
mer in 1958 he spent as a ditch digger for the Pacific Gas & Elec-
tric Co. I recall his capable work on the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee and as a Federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit. While I may not agree with Judge Breyer on every
issue, I have found him to be a man of keen intellect, and he ap-
pears to possess the necessary qualifications to serve as an Associ-
ate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening remarks, and I will
use the remainder of my time during this round for questioning
Judge Breyer.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, if you will yield for a moment, I would
like the record to show, to emphasize what you stated at the out-
set. I will put it another way: One out of every four Justices who
ever served on the Supreme Court in the history of the United
States, you oversaw the hearing. One out of four. That is astound-
ing.
  What are you going to do the next 25 years?
  Senator THURMOND. I expect to have a part in a good many more
in the future. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Good. All right. I thank you for yielding. One out
of four. That is incredible. Twenty-six percent of all the Justices,
you have voted on.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, I have some questions. If
there are any that you feel it would be improper to answer, well,
you say so. Otherwise, I will propound the questions.
  The role of the judicial branch of Government is to interpret the
law. Unfortunately, there are times when some judges go beyond
that authority and legislate from the bench rather than interpret-
ing the law before the Court.
  Where, in your view, does a conscientious judge draw the line be-
tween judicial decisionmaking and legislative decisionmaking?
  Additionally, if confirmed, what approach could you use in resolv-
ing whether or not a decision was the type that should be made
by a judge or an elected legislative body?
  Judge BREYER. Thank you. I think that is a good question. I
think that is an important question, and the short answer to the
question is: Of course, a judge should not legislate from the bench.
The difficult part of the question is how you know. How do you
know when there are broad, open areas of law? And I think you
                                      137
ask yourself two things. Particularly if it's a statute, you ask your-
self who did Congress give the power to, to fill in the blanks?

  One strong possibility is they gave it to someone else like the ex-
ecutive branch or they kept it for themselves.

  Another question you ask is: Can I, in fact, justify this interpre-
tation of the statute through its language and through its history?
And if the answer to that question is no, then there is a danger
signal that you are legislating, which you should not do.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, in McCleskey v. Kemp, the
U.S. Supreme Court held that a capital defendant who contested
his death sentence on the basis of racial discrimination is required
to prove that the decisionmakers in his own case acted with dis-
criminatory purposes. The Court rejected the use of statistics from
unrelated cases to establish racial discrimination in the imposition
of the death penalty.

  Recently, the House of Representatives adopted a provision in its
crime bill which would overturn the McCleskey decision and allow
a capital defendant to challenge and avoid his death sentence
based on statistics from unrelated cases.

  Do you believe that statistics on race from unrelated cases should
be used and, further, are reliable indicators to determine the ap-
propriateness of the death penalty?

  Judge BREYER. I would say, Senator, that there are statistics and
statistics. Obviously, statistics must be reliable. Obviously, it is
easy to use statistics that are not reliable to prove almost anything.
I do not think there is an absolute rule that bars the use of statis-
tics, where they are reliable, in proving a legal point.

  In respect to the particular law that you are discussing, which
is now legislation pending before Congress, I think that, of course,
is Congress' decision, and as Congress decides it, so should the
courts enforce it.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, if confirmed, you will succeed
Justice Blackmun, who recently stated his belief that capital pun-
ishment is inherently flawed under the Constitution. While I dis-
agree with his pronouncement, I want to know if you find his posi-
tion reasonable in light of Supreme Court decisions in this area
and your own personal reflections on whether capital punishment
is constitutional under appropriate circumstances?

  Judge BREYER. Senator, if a judge has strong personal views on
a matter as important as the death penalty, views that he believes
might affect his decision in such a case, he should, perhaps, if they
are very strong--and this happens sometimes. In lower courts I
have seen it happen where you feel you have a personal view that
does not necessarily reflect the law, and you might take yourself
out of the case. I have no such personal view in respect to the
death penalty. So I would sit on such a case.

  In respect to the constitutionality of the death penalty, it seems
to me that the Supreme Court has considered that matter for quite
a long time, in a large number of cases. And, indeed, if you look
at those cases, you will see that the fact that there are some cir-
cumstances in which the death penalty.is consistent with the cruel
and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution is, in my opin-
ion, settled law. At this point it is settled.
                                      138
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, it is likely that Justice
Blackmun is most widely known to the public as the author of Roe
v. Wade. What was your impression of his majority opinion in that
landmark decision? In particular, give us your thoughts on where
he draws the line at different points during pregnancy as it relates
to the State's interest in the regulation of abortion-related services?
  For instance, do you agree that the first trimester of pregnancy
is distinctive and that the State should not be able to prohibit abor-
tion during that period?
  Judge BREYER. YOU are asking questions, Senator, that I know
are matters of enormous controversy. The case of Roe v. Wade has
been the law
  Senator THURMOND. Speak a little bit louder.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; the case of Roe v. Wade has been the law
for 21 years or more, and it was recently affirmed by the Supreme
Court of the United States in the case of Casey. That is the law.
The questions that you are putting to me are matters of how that
basic right applies, where it applies, under what circumstances.
And I do not think I should go into those for the reason that those
are likely to be the subject of litigation in front of the Court.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, article I of the Constitution
gives specific legislative powers to the Congress. One particular
power granted to the Congress is the power to tax. Members of
Congress are elected by the people and are accountable through the
ballot box for their support or opposition on tax matters.
  Do you believe that Federal judges who serve for life and are un-
accountable to the American electorate should have the power to
order tax increases or new taxes as a part of a judicial remedy?
  Judge BREYER. Again, Senator, I think there it is not possible to
be categorical. I think much depends upon the circumstance. I
know that the Supreme Court has held that there are cir-
cumstances in which such tax orders are permissible, and, there-
fore, I start with the assumption that that is the holding of the
Court. And since the Court has held that, there could be such cir-
cumstances. Exactly what they are, I cannot tell you at this mo-
ment.
  Senator THURMOND. Then Congress, of course, would have to
change it if we think it is improper.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is correct. That is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. And that is what I hope we can do.
  Judge Breyer, as an original judge-member of the U.S. Sentenc-
ing Commission, you were closely involved in drafting the sentenc-
ing guidelines. Congressionally enacted mandatory minimum sen-
tences are now applied through the sentencing guidelines.
  In November 1992, while chief judge of the first circuit, you pre-
pared a memorandum for Phil Heymann, who recently served as
President Clinton's Deputy Attorney General. In that memo, you
outlined major criticisms of the guidelines which you believed were
valid.
  The criticisms in your memorandum are as follows: First, manda-
tory minimum sentences in statutes distort the guidelines. Second,
the guidelines insufficiently encourage departures. Third, the
guidelines are too complicated. Fourth, the guidelines are not re-
                                      139
sponding sufficiently to empirical research. Fifth, the guidelines
pay inadequate attention to intermediate punishments.

  Judge Breyer, what prompted you to prepare that memorandum,
and do you consider it an accurate reflection of your current views
on the guidelines?

  Judge BREYER. Senator, basically that memorandum was a sum-
mary of a speech that I gave to a group of judges in Williamsburg,
VA, and the memorandum was attached to the whole speech, but
I thought a summary might be appropriate.

  I think the actual wording of it was a little more tactful, possibly,
than it was listing criticisms and was saying to some extent they
are justified, to some extent they are not justified.

  I think those are a list of the criticisms that have been made of
the guidelines. I think to some extent they are justified. I think
there is room for improvement. They are not fatal to the guideline
effort, and I think Judge Wilkins would agree, frankly. I think
Judge Wilkins has always been on the side, as of I--we have al-
ways seen eye to eye on this, and basically we think that we would
like it, as former Sentencing Commissioners, if Congress really
would delegate to the Commission the authority to create the sen-
tence. Then if the Commission does not do a good job, then Con-
gress would change it.

  But Judge Wilkins and I, I believe, have always thought we
would like to see that authority delegated to the Commission.

  Senator THURMOND. I believe you also suggested here some-
where, too, that moderate judges be appointed to the Commission.
Is that correct?

  Judge BREYER. Yes; it seems to me that in order to build the--
the Commission was given an awfully difficult job, and one of the
difficulties is, of course, you are operating in a world where the
judges are used to deciding all these things on their own. And it
is not surprising that some are suspicious of a new entity. And to
the extent that you could bring sort of moderate judges, not--you
know, just judges with experience in sentencing and so forth, and
you bring them on to the Commission. I think it helps win accept-
ability for the Commission within the world of the judiciary.

  Senator THURMOND. Would you care to tell us what kind of per-
son you consider a moderate judge?

  Judge BREYER. I think a good person, Senator. I am in favor of
moderate judges. I would not like to name names.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, we frequently hear the argu-
ment that courts act in response to various social problems because
the legislature has failed to act on its own. How would you respond
to this defense of an activist judiciary?

  Judge BREYER. I basically think that the judge has to believe
more and it has to be true that there is more. The judge cannot
act unless there is more than a simple belief that there is a social
problem. Rather, it must be the case that there is a statute or the
Constitution itself that creates a law that perhaps another branch
of Government would be better off implementing the sub-laws or
statutes or regulation. But basically the judge's decision must be
tied back to a law, just as the greatest law which has lead to the
greatest change is the 14th amendment to the Constitution. And
judges who implemented that great law, which promised fairness
                                      140
to all Americans, were not following their own point of view. They
were, rather, carrying out the basic promise of fairness that was
written into the Constitution. And it is that grounding of law that
I think made those decisions lawful, justified, and effective.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, I was pleased to learn of your
concerns with excessive regulation. There has been criticism that,
too often, regulatory bodies go beyond the issuance of regulations
pursuant to a congressional delegation and actually begin legislat-
ing.

  What steps, if any, do you believe that Congress and the courts
each should take to curtail improper or excessive regulations?

  Judge BREYER. The primary audience to which I have addressed
what I have written on this subject is the Congress, the regulators,
the environmentalists, the health groups, the industry--those who
are affected and who have a direct stake in the regulation. And ba-
sically there I have said this is what the situation seems to be. If
you agree, fine. And then it is up to you to implement that, pri-
marily through rules and regulations and statutes, not judicial de-
cisions. And they either will or will not agree.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, the free exercise clause of the
first amendment guarantees that Congress shall make no law pro-
hibiting the free exercise of religion. In effect, this secures to each
American the ability to exercise his or her religion free of encroach-
ment by the Government. Proponents of in-home education often do
not use the State schools because of their desire to include religious
instruction in their children's curriculum.

  Would you discuss your views on an American's right to educate
his or her children in the home as it relates to the Government's
interest in regulation in-home education?

  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, that that right is an important
right that, I think it is widely recognized, stems from the first
amendment to the Constitution, which is designed to protect what
is so very important to every American and every American's fam-
ily: the right to practice your own religion, the right to pass on
your religious beliefs to your children. That is there, and it is pro-
tected in the expression of free religion.

  The Government, of course, has some interest to see that edu-
cation is actually taking place. There is always a Government in-
terest in making certain that there is some kind of education really
going on. To balance those two things is difficult and requires fine
judgments in particular cases.

  When I wrote my case on the subject, the law itself, which since
at the constitutional level changed, required that balancing. You in
Congress have written a statute that goes back to that balancing
approach. I can go no further because I think that that statute is
likely to be the subject of litigation.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, under the 10th amendment to
the Constitution, powers not delegated to the Federal Government
are reserved to the States and the people. I have been deeply con-
cerned that this amendment has undergone significant erosion as
the Federal Government continues its expansion into every facet of
people's lives.

  Do you believe that the 10th amendment is an effective limita-
tion on the expansion of the Federal Government?
                                      141
  Judge BREYER. I think there are two separate questions there,
Senator. The simple answer is yes, but there are two parts to the
answer.
  To what extent does the Constitution itself and the 10th amend-
ment prevent Congress from acting? And I think there most people
would believe there is some kind of a core in respect to State activ-
ity, particularly at the governmental level, protecting, say, the
State government from others saying whether it should have one
house in a legislature or two houses in a legislature.
  The way in which the State sets up its own governmental institu-
tions, whether that is protected by the 10th amendment or the re-
publican form of government clause or something else is a matter
of debate. But I think it is widely accepted there is some range of
constitutional protection.
  Beyond that, although the Supreme Court in the League of Cities
case began to expand the area of constitutional protection to in-
clude wages and hours of municipal employees, that sort of thing,
it then retracted that view in Garcia. And where we stand today
is, yes, there is protection, but it seems that most of the degree of
protection is up to Congress. After all, Congress talks to the may-
ors, talks to the Governors, develops programs of cooperation, de-
cides what the role of the State or the city will be, and thus it be-
comes primarily a congressional decision to tailor programs that
appropriately recognize the roles of the States.
  Senator THURMOND. Related to this, unfunded Federal mandates
are an overwhelming financial burden upon the States. What is
your opinion of unfunded Federal mandates upon the States?
  Judge BREYER. I smile a little, Senator, because it seems to me
that that is an excellent example of your last question. Indeed, I
know there are great difficulties, and I know you are more familiar
with those difficulties than I by quite a long shot. And you are the
person who is very sensitive to the problems of the towns and the
States and the cities that may arise from those mandates. And I
do believe that those problems are best translated--indeed, I think
that is the state of constitutional law at the moment, as I under-
stand it. I am hesitant because I am not an expert on this point.
But basically that is transmitted through Congress, and Congress
will give appropriate recognition to that kind of concern.
  Senator THURMOND. AS you may know, Judge Breyer, I am the
ranking member of this committee's Antitrust, Monopolies, and
Business Rights Subcommittee. As a judge who has written exten-
sively on the antitrust laws, could you please summarize your
views very briefly on the purposes and goals of the antitrust laws
and their importance to the competitiveness of U.S. business, both
here and abroad?
  Judge BREYER. Senator, I was quite lucky about, I guess, lVfe, 2
years ago now and was at this conference I spoke of earlier with
500 Russian judges, and they are very interested--there I would
get into a lot of private conversations. And they are very interested
not only in basic constitutional protections but also economic orga-
nization. The point that I would frequently make in those conversa-
tions is that if you are going to have a free enterprise economy, if
you are not going to have the Government running everything,
then you must have a strong and effective antitrust law.
                                      142

  If you are not going to regulate airlines, you must have a strong
antitrust law for airlines. 'Hie reason is that antitrust law is the
policeman. Antitrust law aims, through the competitive process, at
bringing about low prices for consumers, better products, and more
efficient methods of production.

  Those three things, in my mind, are the key to antitrust law and
really a strong justification for an economy in which there are win-
ners and losers, and some people get rich and others do not. The
justification lies in the fact that that kind of economy is better for
almost everyone, and it will not be better for almost everyone un-
less the gains of productivity are spread. And the gains of produc-
tivity are spread through competition. That brings about low
prices, better products, and more efficient methods of production.
And that is what I think antitrust law is about, and that is what
I think that policeman of the free enterprise system has to do. It
is called protect the consumer.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, I believe my time is about up. I
would just ask you this: I believe you attended Oxford and grad-
uated there?

  Judge BREYER. Yes, sir, I did.
  Senator THURMOND. And you found that compatible with the
military?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, sir, I did. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I think your time is up, Senator. I was about to
say you can have as much time as you would like.
  Senator Metzenbaum.
 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWARD M. METZENBAUM, A

              U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Breyer, nice to see you this after-
noon.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me start off by saying where I am. I
expect you to be confirmed, and I expect to vote for your confirma-
tion.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU are clearly a man of integrity, excep-
tional legal skill, high intellectual ability. You have been widely
praised for your political and academic credentials. You have had
some very able spokespersons speak on your behalf today, four very
distinguished and well-respected Members of the U.S. Senate.
  There is not much question about the fact that you have excep-
tional legal credentials. I must say, however, that I am concerned
about your position and your views on the fair competition laws
which affect the day-to-day lives of all Americans. I am talking
about the antitrust laws that Senator Thurmond just raised with
you, the antitrust laws that are in place in order to keep prices low
and products safe for consumers, to make the competitive market
work.
  Those same laws protect small businesses against abusive cor-
porate giants and prevent price-gouging monopolies and cartels
from harming consumers.
  You have been outspoken with respect to the consumer protec-
tion laws known as antitrust, but your record suggests, unfortu-
                                      143
nately, to my mind, that you almost always vote against the very
people the antitrust laws are in place to protect.

  A 1991 study in the Fordham Law Review reported that in all
16 of your antitrust decisions, Judge Breyer voted against the al-
leged victim of antitrust abuse. You seem to see antitrust laws in
terms of abstract economics. And it seems that theories of economic
efficiency displayed in complicated charts, one of which I will use
at a later point in the hearing, and graphs replace individual jus-
tice for small businesses and consumers.

  As you well know, that is not my view of antitrust. I see it as
the protector of mom-and-pop businesses and the guardian of
consumer rights.

  Let me be clear. To me, antitrust is not some mysterious legal
theory that only lawyers can understand. Antitrust is just an old-
fashioned word for fair competition. It is a word that made sense
to the average American 104 years ago when the first antitrust law
was passed. At that time, trusts, which were cartels of big compa-
nies, such as oil companies, railroads, and other giants, fixed prices
or cut prices or boycotted small businesses or used whatever under-
handed tactics it took to ruin their rivals. These trusts were so
ruthless that small businesses and consumers did not stand a
chance against their power.

  So Congress came along and outlawed trusts and cartels and mo-
nopolies, in President Wilson's words, to protect "the little man."
John Sherman, a Republican Senator from my own State, wrote
the first antitrust law in 1890 to give every American a fair shot
at starting a business and getting a square deal as a consumer.
President Teddy Roosevelt, the Nation's legendary trust buster,
used the antitrust laws as a weapon against corporate abuse.

  Today, I am frank to say that many public officials have forgot-
ten what the antitrust laws are supposed to do. They have let high-
paid lawyers and corporate giants convince them that our only
legal yardstick should be whatever is good for business. They would
have us believe that antitrust lawsuits are too complicated, too dif-
ficult to understand for juries of average Americans, and that eco-
nomic theory is more important than common sense and experi-
enced business judgment. To me, that kind of thinking is simply
absurd.

  I can tell you from personal experience as a long-time
businessperson and as chairman of the Senate's Antitrust Sub-
committee that small businesses and consumers rely on the protec-
tion of our antitrust laws. I think it is important that in this hear-
ing in some way this Senator try to sensitize you to the fact that,
even today, small businesses and consumers are threatened by un-
fair competition from big businesses.

  Fortunately, we do not need new laws to protect them. What we
need are judges with the wisdom and courage to use those laws to
stop corporate big-wigs from abusing their market power.

  While I will begin my questioning of you by focusing on antitrust,
I would like to point out another matter that troubles me. As you
know, Judge, I have made clear my concerns about your participa-
tion in cases that involve environmental pollution issues, given
your investments in Lloyd's of London. In your opening statement
this morning, you very properly this morning promised to divest
                                      144
yourself of all insurance holdings as soon as possible, and I am
frank to say that I appreciate your sensitivity and willingness to
respond to some concerns that I had expressed to representatives
of the White House about that subject and about any appearance
of impropriety.

  I still have a number of questions concerning your involvement
in Lloyd's and the distinctions you drew when recusing yourself
from asbestos. This one I had difficulty in understanding, why you
recused yourself in the asbestos cases but not other environmental
cases.

  Now, I am frank to tell you, Judge, that you are the first nomi-
nee to come before us who is actively involved in Lloyd's of London,
and I got to tell you, I am grateful to you. I have learned more
about Lloyd's of London in the last several days than I learned in
my entire previous 77 years. I thought that I knew something
about what was happening in the business world and even in the
insurance area. But I am frank to say that by my studying that
which I understand to be approximately 100 investments of yours
in different syndicates at Lloyd's, that is pretty unusual for an
American businessperson, because each investment involves unlim-
ited liability that can vastly exceed the actual amount of money in-
vested.

  I am frank to tell you I am not sure whether the 100 figure is
right. At one point, I heard it was 69, and at one point, I heard
it was something else. But I gather sometimes one syndicate rolls
over into another syndicate, and it is a question whether that is
two numbers or one number.

  While most of your syndicates have been closed, and an approxi-
mate amount of profit or loss ascertained, one syndicate that has
become a high-profile issue--Merritt 418, which was the syndicate
from 1985--cannot be closed. Merritt 418 includes extensive envi-
ronmental pollution coverage that no one has been willing to take
over. So, as I understand it, you remain personally liable for a por-
tion of Merritt 418's massive losses, and we are not talking about
insignificant amounts of money. We are talking about significant
hundreds of thousands of dollars, as I calculate it.

  You may remain liable on that investment sometime into the fu-
ture, and I do not think you know how long that will be or I know,
but I think you are hopeful to get out of it as soon as possible. And
you made that clear in your opening statement. But I also under-
stand it is a rather difficult one to get out of.

  At a later point in the hearings, I intend to ask you about envi-
ronmental decisions which might affect you financially. For today,
I will go back to the subject of antitrust, but in a subsequent round
of hearings, I do expect to get into that entire matter.

  Coming to the question of antitrust, I must say I am extremely
troubled by your reasoning in Town of Concord v. Boston Edison.
You overturned a jury verdict and a district court judge's review of
that verdict. As I understand the case, the jury found the consum-
ers in Concord, MA, were overcharged on their electricity bills by
$13 million. That verdict was trebled to $39 million as an antitrust
penalty against Boston Edison, which sold Concord 95 percent of
its electricity.
                                      145
  After hearing testimony for 13 days from experts on both sides,
the jury found that Concord's small, municipally owned electric
company could only get most of its energy from Boston Edison, a
huge power company which generates, transmits, and sells elec-
tricity. Boston Edison serves the communities adjacent to Concord.
The jury found that by raising Concord's wholesale rates, which
Federal regulators automatically rubberstamp and only review
later, Boston Edison unfairly raised Concord's costs and actually
stole some of their customers as well.
  In overturning the jury decision to provide the consumers of Con-
cord $39 million, you wrote, "Effective price regulation at both the
first and second industry levels makes it unlikely that requesting
such rates will ordinarily create a serious risk of significant anti-
competitive harm."
  Here the regulation could not bring back lost business. The dis-
trict court judge found the jury had ample evidence of competitive
harm. And my question is: In view of the jury verdict, the court's
verdict, the position that the city of Concord and the people of that
community were in, why did you disregard all of those facts and
replace them with a graph and a chart that are completely hypo-
thetical? Let me show you the graph and the chart. It says here--
I do not know what the chart means. It says up there "Town of
Concord v. Boston Edison," and then it says "Total M's cost price."
Down here it says, "It costs $1 to make a widget. A single monopo-
list M will maximize his profit by setting a price of $6, and selling
five widgets, his profit is $25 [represented by the area RSTU]," and
it goes on.
  Now, frankly, I do not know whether the people of the city of
Concord had too much interest in the widgets, but I think they
were very interested in the $39 million verdict that they had and,
frankly, that you took away from them. And I wonder if you could
explain how you arrived at this conclusion to reverse the lower
court in that case?
  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, that I should start with a gen-
eral point, a negative general point, then a positive general point,
and then something rather specific.
  The negative general point is, of course, I don't count up how
many victories are for plaintiffs or defendants and do statistics.
Sometimes plaintiffs did win in antitrust cases I have had. And, as
you point out, defendants often won. The plaintiff sometimes is a
big business, and sometimes is not. The defendant sometimes is,
and sometimes is not.
  What I am interested in is is the case correct as a matter of law,
and I consider the cases one at a time, and I consider the merits,
the legal merits of the arguments in front of me.
  My general positive point is this, where I hope and expect very
much that you will agree, because, frankly, I have read what you
say often on antitrust, and you are going to think that this comes
from things that you have said to business people, because I have
read them and I think it does.
  But there is a keystone to antitrust, and you have said it before
and you say it again, and the keystone to antitrust, what antitrust
is all about is getting low prices for consumers, not high prices, and
getting better products for consumers, not worse products, and get-
                                      146
ting more efficient methods of production. And that simple three-
part key which I carry around I think engraved in my brain I try
to use to unlock these incredibly complex, unbelievably technical
legal arguments that are brought up in an area like the one in the
case that you mentioned, something called the price squeeze.

  Now, in fact, as I will explain now in detail, that key does unlock
that door. But in order to show how would I have thought our
court's decision, our unanimous decision there, how I thought that
that key, low prices, led to the technical result, what I want to do
is write an opinion that will explain these technical matters, boy,
this was very technical, but will explain it so that a person who
is willing to put in time and effort, even without economic training,
will see the point intuitively.

  And the chart that you mentioned, which has a numerical exam-
ple and has a graphic example, is designed to help a person who
is really interested in following every bit of that, to use the chart
or use the numbers or use the language three different ways to
show how the key, which is the low price, unlocks the complicated
door of the case.

  Now, this is how in my mind it did in that case. How can I ex-
plain what a price squeeze is? My goodness. Basically, the idea is
this: Electricity is made by big integrated companies. They make
electricity by having turbines go around.

  Let's say--and I will use a hypothetical, I don't like to use that
here, because I know this isn't a classroom and I know these are
serious matters and I don't like to be professorial, frankly, but I
think in this instance, maybe thinking of, say, they turn this wheel
around and they charged 8 cents for the electricity, and that might
help.

  They then transmit it across a wire. They then sell it to them-
selves, because they are in the retail operation, too. And they sold
it, let us say, for 10 cents. So they make it for 8 cents and they
sell it to themselves for 10 cents, and the price to the consumer is
10 cents.

  Now, the plaintiff in this case came along and said, you see, 8
cents is what we have to pay for it, because they sold a little bit
to independent retailers, too, and that plaintiff was an independent
retailer. And that independent retailer was saying, wait, I buy this
for 8 cents and they resell to themselves for 10 cents, that 2 cents
isn't big enough as a space, I am getting squeezed.

  And if he had won that case, if that plaintiff had won that case,
what would have happened is, instead of that price being 10 cents
for all the consumers in Massachusetts, that price would have gone
up to 11 cents or 12 cents. That is how I saw the case.

  So, while I know you could make theoretical arguments the other
way, the practical argument was that if plaintiffs here won--by the
way, the plaintiffs here were not losing an amount of money, they
were making a little bit of profit--the principle under which they
would win I thought, and my court thought, would drive up the
price of electricity to consumers all over Massachusetts.

  Now, two things: One, the State regulatory commission is holding
that price down. The State regulatory commission says 10 cents is
the right price. And if you have a State regulator out there protect-
ing the citizens of Massachusetts and saying 10 cents is right, then
                                      147
I do not think an antitrust court should come along with a rule of
law that makes for a higher price. There is too big a risk of that
happening.

  But, after all, there could be a lot of special circumstances. So,
we are fairly careful in that case in the opinion to say we are not
saying this could never be bad. We are not saying this is absolute.
We are not saying there could not be circumstances where the price
squeeze would be a bad thing. But in these circumstances here, it
is not good for consumers for the plaintiff to win.

  By the way, all the facts in the case, the court of appeals, as you
correctly point out, are assumed in favor of the plaintiff. That is
because the jury found in favor of the plaintiff. Then the question
is, assuming all the facts in the plaintiffs in the favor, does the
antitrust law require a verdict for the plaintiff. And I absolutely
grant you that is a highly controversial area. It is a difficult area,
and I cannot be certain as I sit here now that we have come to the
exactly correct result.

  What I can be certain of is what our court tried to do. We tried
to focus on where the ball really is, which is the low price for the
consumer, and we tried to work our way through a very com-
plicated area to see if antitrust law, which has as its objective,
technically would come to that result. I do not guarantee I was
right. I do not guarantee that others do not have good arguments
the other way. What I do guarantee is what we were trying to do,
how we were trying to interpret the law.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I have to take issue with you
about your wanting to bring about lower rates. The jury wanted to
bring Concord's electric rates down and hold down rates for Boston
Edison with proper regulation, and, with the jury's verdict, the
rates would have been lower. But you stepped in and you said ju-
ries will be permitted to second-guess the regulators' allocation
rules or its specific investment allocation decisions. What antitrust
benefit would be gained by permitting juries to speculate in this
way, is your question?

  Let me answer your question: Congress did not give the regu-
lators the power to make antitrust determinations. We gave anti-
trust determinations to the juries and the courts. This jury was
protecting consumers who were gouged, and a small company, a
very small company, the Concord company was a very small com-
pany, that was unfairly squeezed.

  Unfortunately, as I see it, you seemed more worried about ruf-
fling the regulators' feathers than protecting the consumers. My
question is why was it appropriate for you to discount the expert
testimony, disregard the jury factfinding that the district court
found fully supported by the record in this case, and reverse the
lower court and the jury's verdict?

  That is where I have difficulty, and your answer is that you were
helping to keep rates down, but here was a $39 million verdict for
the city of Concord, and I have difficulty in following your line of
reasoning as to how your verdict against the plaintiffs and taking
way the jury verdict helped to keep prices down.

  Judge BREYER. Basically, the reason, Senator, was that I think
it was our obligation, in trying to interpret the antitrust law, to
work out how the rule of law in that case, perhaps in that case it
                                      148

would have meant lower prices for Concord, though I am not sure
how, but even there the issue is what about all the citizens of Mas-
sachusetts, what happens to all the citizens who buy electricity.

  And my belief was, and what we wrote in the case and tried to
explain why, is if a little company--and he was small--can insist
that that rate go up from 10 cents to 12 cents, everyone all over
Massachusetts, not just Concord, is going to be paying 12 cents and
not 10 cents, and that is higher prices, not lower prices, and the
antitrust laws ought not to allow that, if we are following their
basic principles. And then I trace through in the opinion why I
think that is what would happen if the plaintiff won.

  As I said, I do not think we took away any factfinding from the
jury, and I understand that the plaintiffs in the case may disagree.
I understand people who study this in very good faith may dis-
agree. I understand that there are two sides to the issue. But I do
think that what the court is trying to do in that case is trying to
follow through the basic thrust of the antitrust law and to deter-
mine how that aim at low prices works out in this complicated
area. And I think that the holding in the case, rather than the con-
trary holding, means lower prices for electricity consumers in Mas-
sachusetts and elsewhere.

  I can give you another example, if you like.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I only have about 5 minutes left,
and may I go on?
  Judge BREYER. Please.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you. I do not think we are going
to come to an agreement.
  Judge BREYER. In good faitn, I think people do disagree about
many of these holdings.
  Senator METZENBAUM. In one of your earliest cases, Allen Pen
Co., Inc. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., Inc., you sided with the
defendant. The plaintiff was a small firm that bought school sup-
plies from the Springfield company. The way I read the case,
Springfield offered lower prices to its favored customers and every-
one else had to pay more. The undisputed evidence was that when
Allen Pen fell out of favor with Springfield, it had to pay 5 percent
more for the same supplies. So it sued Springfield for discrimina-
tory pricing under the antitrust laws.
  The district court judge did not let the jury decide the case. In-
stead, he directed a verdict for the defendant. You affirmed that
decision. What you said was that Allen Pen, which was a small
company, could not win its case, because

It produced no economic expert, it did not go out of business, it showed no absolute
drop in the sales, the sales affected were but a tiny fraction of its total business,
and there was no causal connection between any antitrust violation and any signifi-
cant actual injury.

  Let me ask you, does a small company have to go out of business
before our fair competition laws apply? Is that the sine qua non?

  Judge BREYER. NO, no; I think that case was a matter of evi-
dence, and I would guess that how much evidence there was was
a matter of the court looked at it and thought there was not
enough evidence. I cannot repeat to you now. I mean it is just that
sometimes--look, let me give you Cartel. Cartel is a good case. Car-
tel is a case in which a defendant won. Cartel is a case in which
                                      149
the big defendant won. Cartel is a case in which the smaller plain-
tiff lost. Cartel is a case in which that big defendant was an insur-
ance company in the health insurance area.

  What the big defendant was trying to do to the insurance com-
pany was to hold down the price of health care. The plaintiffs were
people who wanted to raise the price of health care. They wanted
to raise the price of health care and they thought the antitrust
laws helped them do it.

  It seems to me that by looking at the basic purpose of the anti-
trust laws, which is to keep prices down, to protect the consumer,
when you do that, you get the key to a lot of these matters, and
that is basically what I have tried to do, and I cannot tell you I
have always done it right.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, in this particular case we are talk-
ing about, the small company put its president on the stand to tes-
tify about how much money it lost when it had to pay higher
prices. It gave the jury his best estimate of what the company's
losses were, based on his knowledge of the business and the compa-
ny's history. You actually criticized the company for using a busi-
nessman, instead of an economist, to show that it was injured by
unfair competition.

  Again, this is a case of whether a small business company has
to pay for an expensive economic expert who can charge $500 or
more just to get his case to the jury. What concerns to me, and I
think some who have studied your record, is that you are more in-
clined to follow some esoteric theory of the law or maybe some reg-
ulatory approach to the law, than you are the whole concept of let-
ting free competition work, and the whole question of protecting
that small business person.

  I have a number of other cases I will ask you about that come
to a similar conclusion, where the little guy gets squeezed out, was
not able to buy parts and has to buy a particular automobile pack-
age in order to get--I think it was Subaru cars--and, one after the
other, Judge Breyer is not sensitive to the fact that the little guy
does not have a chance, except for the antitrust laws, and Judge
Breyer routinely--there are some exceptions. In the Cartel case,
you are correct, you ruled with the plaintiff. But the fact is, in too
many cases, time after time, as the Fordham article indicates, your
hold against the little guy, the small business person, the
consumer.

  I do not think you did anything wrong or improper. All I am hop-
ing to do in these hearings is maybe sensitize you enough, and
when you get on the Supreme Court, maybe you will remember,
gee, I remember those questions I had when I was appearing before
the Judiciary Committee, maybe the milk of human kindness will
run through you and you will not be so technical.

  Judge BREYER. I guarantee you, I will remember. [Laughter.]
  Senator METZENBAUM. I have other questions, Mr. Chairman. My
time has expired, but I know we are going around.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I am sure at the first conference, after
the first case, he will turn to Justice Scalia and say, you know, let's
think how Metzenbaum would do this. [Laughter.]
  Senator METZENBAUM. I know that you and Justice Scalia will
work it out.

  Senator HATCH. I just want to know if Howard finally got it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. What did you say?
  The CHAIRMAN. He wanted to know if you finally got it, he said.
  Senator Simpson.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ALAN K. SIMPSON, A U.S.
             SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING

  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I am glad I was not involved in that line of inquiry there about
the milk of human kindness. My friend Howard Metzenbaum and
I do not always agree, but I mean sincerely I shall miss his pres-
ence. He and I have sharpened our rapiers on each other for 15
years, and it has been an experience that started I think with sus-
picion, and certainly ends with mutual respect. I enjoy him. As I
say, we do not agree, indeed. But if he is speaking on antitrust, you
want to listen.
  Well, it is a pleasure to see you here. I listened intently this
morning and thought I had known a great deal of your background.
But when they got to the part about architecture, I want to find
more about that.
  It is time to talk of many things, of shoes and ships and ceiling
wax. I want to find out more about that, and I shall.
  It is good to see your family here, and I remember meeting them
when I was a freshman on this committee. Michael, while you are
out there hiking through the country, I will be astride a horse out
in Wyoming. You will be walking, and I will be riding. I hope you
will enjoy the Wind Rivers. It is a marvelous area, if that is where
you are going. I hunch you are.
  Seldom I think in these times, certainly in this century, certainly
not at any time in my 15 years on this committee, have members
had an opportunity to consider a nomination to the Supreme Court
of a person who many of us personally know so well.
  And I would note that while the consent role of the Congress has
always been strictly observed, in this case of your nomination, I be-
lieve the advice provision of article II for the first time in my expe-
rience has been a significant factor, because many of us on this
side of the aisle and on the other side, as well, have offered the ad-
vice that your nomination would be quite well received by the Judi-
ciary Committee.
  Nearly half of the members of this committee knew you when
you served as the chief counsel of this committee. We all are per-
sonally familiar with your intellect, your ability, your professional
bearing, and your sense of fairness. A term that I noted was used
several times in your statement, fairness or fair. And you were
very courteous and helpful to me, as a freshman Senator, never
judging or measuring things with a political yardstick, interest-
ingly enough, always grounded in fairness. That is a word I think
that typifies what I know about you from my personal observation
post.
  And you have had a fine, remarkable education. I loved your
statement about the things you learned about people which you
didn't learn from books, or something to that effect, and I think
that is certainly true in my life. Yet, the books took me to where
                                      151
I could go into a profession that I loved, into law. And your work
in academia and your work on the bench has been exemplary.

  The Supreme Court is unique in both the size of its workload and
in the closed and I think necessarily private environment in which
it works, which is going to be a tough one for you, but you will han-
dle that. You mentioned that, too, in your statement. I forget the
term, but not to cloister yourself away. That was not the term, but
I cannot see you anywhere near that, with your persona.

  But to simply be able to cope with the volume of work requires
a superior intellect, but, just as important, the absolute necessity
to work collegially with your fellow Justices. As chief counsel of
this committee you dealt with some of the most controversial issues
that came before the Congress, and that was the ideal crucible to
develop and display those qualities.

  They say there is no proving ground like it, here in the Judiciary
Committee--and I do always admire our chairman, Joe Biden. He
is very fair, and he faces controversy with more patience than I do.
When I get a belly full of something, it shows all over my face, and
then I am in deep trouble. And our ranking member, Senator
Hatch, is patient and always willing to listen. But I shan't forget
when Senator Kennedy came before us in an imploring fashion,
after we had dispatched the former President in 1980, and said:
"How about Steve Breyer?" And we said: "no". And then Senator
Thurmond, who was ranking member, interceded, the committee
met and duly judged that you should pass into the ranks of the
robed.

  And you did, and you have had a remarkable record. And this
committee is a tough audience, and there are tough inquiries. Sen-
ator Metzenbaum, others of us, Orrin, myself, Ted, and Pat Leahy,
all of us do ask tough questions for which we get some tough com-
mentary at times, and that goes with the territory.

  But it is interesting that very few Senators really stand in line
to serve on this committee, but when they do, they become quite
riveted to what we do here and what we must do in our role, espe-
cially in this role.

  I nave always served, as a legislator, on the Judiciary Commit-
tee--chaired one when I was in the State legislature.

  So we have seen you handle controversial issues with com-
petence. We have watched you deal with members of both parties
with fairness--that word again--and good humor, rare good humor,
and patience, extreme patience. So, then, one might wonder why
we are making this investment of time and energy, significant, in-
deed, on a nomination which seems to have general approval, why
the staff has spent thousands of hours collectively poring over ev-
erything Stephen Breyer has spoken and written on the law.

  I think there are several factors at play here. The first is that
we want a thorough and unhurried examination of the nominee.
That is always justified in the case of a lifetime appointment to a
Court co-equal with and independent of the Presidency and the
Congress. But there is an even more important factor, I think,
which justifies the size of the investigative staffs we now see on
this committee and the intensity of our scrutiny of Supreme Court
nominations. We learned in the 1950's and 1960's that this co-equal
branch of Government, the Supreme Court, could, would, and did

      85-742 - 95 - 6
                                      152
take upon itself the job of making profound changes in American
society and politics when Congress was slow to act or had deter-
mined not to act. And this judicial activism on the part of the Su-
preme Court led to this clearly reduced pace and increased thor-
oughness of evaluating nominees to the Court.

  It became important in the eyes of many members of this com-
mittee to attempt to learn intimately the attitudes and values of
persons nominated to serve on the Court. But sometimes we, all of
us, become overly zealous on the singularly posed question: How
would you vote on this or that critical issue of the day?

  And in my mind, a nominee who is fully qualified by education
and experience and temperament should, nevertheless, be rejected
if a nominee believes it is the Court's duty to act when the Con-
gress fails to do so or to allow his or her personal views and preju-
dices to influence his or her decisions. And yet, conversely, I am
much less concerned about a nominee's ideological bent if he or she
is otherwise well qualified by education, experience, and tempera-
ment; and clearly a person who would assiduously follow the Con-
stitution, the precedents, and the laws of the country, despite his
or her strongly held personal views to the contrary.

  So this great and sometimes ponderous effort to determine the
social and political views of nominees reflects all of our own con-
cerns about judicial activism, whichever side of that we happen to
be on.

  Some claim that this has led to the appointment of what have
been called "stealth nominees," a description which assuredly
would not fit you, for you have left a paper trail a mile wide and
a yard deep: 91 speeches, 50 articles and book chapters, and 80
opinions. Of course, I have nearly completed my own personal ex-
haustive review of these various tomes and treatises. Summer
reading, I call that.

  And I suspect that we have sometimes overdone it in the thor-
oughness of our efforts to learn the ideological beliefs of nominees.
And we should probably spend more time inquiring into the nomi-
nee's judicial philosophy and the analytical approach that he or she
might use in deciding issues and cases.

  We will, of course, also inquire in some detail about current con-
stitutional controversies. I have some questions myself in that area
in this round, and I know that you will attempt to be candid but
circumspect, and respectfully and necessarily guarded in your re-
sponses. I am positive of one thing with you, as surely as anything,
the lodestar, that you will not give our citizens mumbo-jumbo, legal
mumbo-jumbo. You will give them justice. That I know. And that
is the pleasing part of the whole process for me with my personal
knowledge of you.

  Now, let me ask you, I know that Senator Hatch and Senator
Thurmond have talked about the New Life Baptist Church v. East
Longmeadow, and I will not go into the details of that case. But
until recently, the U.S. Supreme Court, not the Congress or the ex-
ecutive branch, has decided the standard to be used to determine
whether the Government's actions have impermissibly burdened a
person's ability to exercise his or her religious beliefs.

  Over time, the Supreme Court developed these several standards
for various types of free exercise claims. For most cases, the Court
                                         153

determines whether the State's interest is compelling and whether
a less restrictive means to accomplish that interest is available. In
Sherbert v. Werner and Yoder--cases brought by prisoners against
prison administrators--the Court standard was whether the re-
strictions on a prisoner's free exercise of religion are reasonably re-
lated to legitimate penological objectives.

  But then came the Supreme Court in the Employment Division
v. Smith. Two employees were convicted of smoking peyote, and
they were fired from their jobs. They claimed that their peyote
smoking was pursuant to their religion. The Court held that no
balancing test between the State's interest and the individual's in-
terest was necessary when a criminal law applied to all activities,
religious or secular, and was not intended to target religious activi-
ties.

   So last year, we enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
as previously mentioned by Senator Hatch and Senator Thurmond,
which overturned the Court's 1990 case standard. And, of course,
that went rolling through here in high fashion. I was very dis-
turbed by it, especially with regard to what it will do in prisons as
we see people selecting what religion they may concoct in order to
drive the prison administrators goofy. But that is my view--I think
that will cause us great pain.

  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act mandated that all free
exercise claims be considered under one standard; the compelling
State interest and the least restrictive means.

  My question: To what extent is it constitutionally permissible for
Congress to provide the courts with a substantive standard for a
free exercise of religion claim? Or to what extent is it constitu-
tionally permissible for Congress to overrule the Supreme Court's
own substantive standards for review of free exercise of religion
claims?

  Judge BREYER. The reason that I smiled, Senator, was because
you have articulated the question exactly that I would imagine is
likely to be before the Supreme Court. And if I am confirmed and
you decide to confirm me, then I would be a member of that Court.
Therefore, I have to exercise caution on that particular question.
That is going to be right there. It is going to be right there.

   Senator SIMPSON. It will be right there, and it will come through
this law.

   Judge BREYER. Yes, it will.
   Senator SIMPSON. And another one that will be right there and
you need not talk about is the issue of the restriction of freedom
of expression, freedom of speech with regard to demonstrations
around abortion clinics. The law has a lot of ramifications that go
far, far beyond freedom of speech. I happen to be pro-choice, and
I supported the provision. But I can see right now the use of that
law in ways which those who promoted it will blanch and shrivel
when that begins to take shape. I can see some of those beginning
to form, and I was part of it. But that is the interesting part of sit-
ting on a Judiciary Committee as you work your craft.
   Well, those are things that are of concern, but with regard to the
New Life Baptist Church v. East Longmeadow, I would just ask
several specific questions which I believe were not entirely covered
in your answers to Senator Hatch and Senator Thurmond. I also
                                      154

have had some which you have answered and which I will not ask
you to repeat.

  You were asked to determine whether the town school committee
could apply the State's standards to determine the adequacy of the
secular education that a religious school provides to its students.
The school said that that mandatory process violated the first
amendment, free exercise rights, since it believed it to be a sin to
submit--and that was the word, "submit"--its educational enter-
prise to a secular authority for approval.

  So in place of the school committee's mandatory approval re-
quirements, the school offered up a less restrictive alternative.
They said they would voluntarily give its students standardized
tests to determine the adequacy of the secular education, then the
school would voluntarily submit the results to the education board
for evaluation.

  You concluded that while the State's mandatory review require-
ments do burden the school's free exercise of its religious activities,
such a burden was permissible. You have given some remarkable
comments about the duty of Government to see that education is
given to all children, and I agree. You based your decision on your
finding that the school committee has a sufficiently compelling in-
terest in seeing that the children are educated, that there is no less
restrictive means available. Not even the school's suggested vol-
untary standardized-test approach that you felt would both accom-
plish the State's interest and be less of a burden on the exercise
of religion. You questioned whether or not the standardized test
would be an adequate measure for the process of teaching, and, of
course--and there was a quote:

  Can it be certain that good results reflect good teaching, the teaching of intellec-
tual skills, discipline, complete subject matter, rather than simply teaching the an-
swers to the questions the teachers believe will appear on tests?

  But all those kinds of tests are routinely used to measure
progress in education, standardized tests. SAT, LSAT, MCAT,
GRE, are all indicators of the likelihood of eventual success. I have
received considerable mail from my State on the nomination on the
most part from constituents writing who are parents who have
their children in private, church-operated schools or parents who
provide home schooling for their children, and this opinion concerns
them. Some feel your decision implies that you believe it is con-
stitutional for States to totally ban home schooling.

  One wrote:

  Not only is this position unconstitutional, but it is also nonsensical, as he would
give unlimited powers to an already failing public school system to regulate private
and home schools, which statistically are turning out well-educated students.

  I am interested in your reasoning, if you could explain for me
why the school standardized tests would not be an acceptable, less
restrictive means to demonstrate adequacy of its secular program,
whether your decision "gives unlimited powers to an already failing
public school system to regulate," but principally how you feel
about home-based education and your response to that, sir?

  Judge BREYER. Three general points, Senator, and then a more
specific point. The three general points are:

  I do not think there is a word in that opinion that suggests, you
know, the kind of thing that you mentioned in that latter, that this
                                      155
powerful State can do what it wants to end the ability of parents
to pass on their religion to their children.

  The second general point is that everything I have learned about
the first amendment--and, interestingly enough, speech has some-
thing to do with it, too--is that that really grew out of the religious
wars of the 17th century, and that really reflects a great com-
promise that runs through modern life in a lot of countries, but
particularly in the United States. And, that is, people have strongly
held religious beliefs, and there are synagogues and there are
churches and there are mosques and there are dozens of different
religious groups. And, that is, that every one of those groups will
have the right to practice their own religion and to pass that reli-
gion on to their children. That is right at the heart of it.

  The third general point is that the test that I was applying con-
stitutionally in that case was before the recent Smith case. The re-
cent Smith case said all you do is look to see if there is a secular
purpose. I take it if that had been the law at the time, it would
not have even been close. And what you have tried to do is go back
to restore the type of balancing test that I used in that opinion.

  Now, the specific thing in that balancing test really grew out of
the particular facts of the case. Some States have laws which say
the way that the State should go in and measure whether the
home school is doing a good job or the religious school is doing a
good job is give people tests. If the State has that, fine and good.

  Our State in that case did not have that. And so it became a
question of whether the Constitution forced the school board to do
it that way rather than do it a different way.

  Among the special facts in the case were there were a lot of indi-
cations through letters and so forth that the visit to the school by
the school board to look and see what was happening could be
worked out without infringing that religious group's basic concern
that the State was not in charge, that they did not recognize State
authority. And that could be worked out because the State was
willing to say: Don't recognize our authority. Just let us look at the
school like anyone else might off the street, or whatever. Do you
mind? And they said, well, we do not mind that much.

  The concern in that case, what the school board had, is: How can
you really say that tests are less restraining or more restraining?
Some parents might believe tests are more of an interference. After
all, you are worried about submitting yourself to the authority of
the State while I have to bring my child and sit them in a special
room and make them take a State test. Some parents might have
felt that way. Other parents might have believed that that was a
better solution and that the visit was a worse solution.

  It is very hard to say, and the school board had to administer
some system. So, ultimately, it turned on the fact that we thought
that is a reasonable system. And it does not really infringe, in gen-
eral, the right of the parents any more than would have the oppo-
site system.

  Senator SIMPSON. Let me ask you a question. You may not be
able to answer it, but it is just right there. Do you have a bias
against home schooling or religious schooling?

  Judge BREYER. Absolutely not.
  Senator SIMPSON. Never have had?
                                      156

  Judge BREYER. I never have had.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think that that is the key and, with your ex-
planation, it will be one that will be helpful for the public to under-
stand.
  Of course, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would change
a lot of things, as you say, outcomes or reviews on that legislation,
and it will be laid at your door, Justice. You will see it there one
morning waif-like, writhing, all yours.
  Now, the confirmation process--I see that the light is still
green
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are doing fine, but if you want to stop, it is
OK. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. I thought you guys were going to go all day.
  The CHAIRMAN. GO right ahead, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. I am going to save one for tomorrow. I am
going to ask the nominee to hone his processes, because here is one
coming--immigration law. That got a little rise.
  The CHAIRMAN. An audible groan.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU see, nobody will touch it. It is too ghastly
to play with. But there are a couple of bills which amend the 14th
amendment, which says:

  Section 1: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they
reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens,

and so on.
  There are statutory proposals to say that a person born in the

United States is not a citizen of the United States, because they
are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The children are born
to an illegal person and become legal citizens at the moment of
birth. Some are saying that, by statute, we could amend this con-
stitutional provision statutorily because they are not being born to
a legal citizen of the United States, and therefore are not "subject
to the jurisdiction thereof." It is going to be a rather knotty one for
us to handle.

  I am going to come back to that in my second round and just ask
you some thoughts, because it is a very difficult issue. Right now
we have a situation where two-thirds of the live births in a certain
area of California are to illegal undocumented mothers who are
giving birth to a U.S. citizen. That U.S. citizen child, when 21
years old, may petition for the mother, the father, the siblings and
through the preference system--an interesting issue, one that
again is something we must pursue.

  It is not something that I have proposed. It is being proposed by
several persons of both parties on this issue, and I will come back
to that.

  I thank the Chairman for your courtesy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Judge, it may be an appropriate time to take a 5-minute break
here, and then we will return. Really, let us make it 5 minutes,
and we will return with Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, is there anything to the rumor
that the reason they are going to me next is that the TV cameras
                                         157

had so adjusted their lights for Senator Simpson's head, they want
to be consistent? [Laughter.]

  Senator SIMPSON. Why don't you tell them the story about
what

  Senator LEAHY. NO, no, I'm not going to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. Then I will. Let me tell you. Mr. Chairman,
you will recall that during
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU go right ahead. I never talk about hair or
lack thereof. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. During a hearing in this committee, a courier
came to the door
  Senator LEAHY. YOU don't have to tell this, Alan.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think I will. You have told it enough times.
It is very short. It is like war stories, you have to get them out of
the way.
  This courier came and said to the person at the door, "I have a
message here for somebody." He said, "Who is it?" He said, "I don't
know. He's tall, bald, homely, and wears glasses." And this guy
looked in and said, "There's two of them." [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. We are recessed for 5 minutes.
   [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge. We will do another hour and a half. We
will do Senators Leahy, Heflin, and Grassley, and we will recon-
vene tomorrow at 10 o'clock, at which time, if all goes as planned,
I believe the next person will be Senator Specter, I think. I am not
sure. The name plates are not up, but I think that is correct.
   Senator Leahy, the floor is yours.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S.
              SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT

   Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, I was thinking, as I was listening to you, I have had the
opportunity in the years I have been in the Senate, now with your
nomination, which I fully expect will go through the Senate, I will
have had an opportunity to vote on all nine members of the Su-
preme Court. I also will have been in the hearings on eight of
them. That is counting Chief Justice Rehnquist in his capacity as
Chief Justice.
   I have an opening statement that I was going to include in the
record as though read, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be included.
   [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows:]

                                  PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY

   When you visit the Supreme court, and walk into the courtroom chamber, you
cannot help but be struck by a special authority that exists there. I remember being
affected this way when I was first there as a law student, and I remember feeling
the same way when I was there just a few weeks ago.

   The courtroom itself is more cramped than you might expect. It essentially con-
sists of a broad wooden bench, behind which sit the nine justices in their high-
backed chairs. Before the bench is a lectern and tables for counsel arguing cases,
as well as tables for clerks and other court personnel. The rest of the chamber is
devoted to rows of chairs for public seating.

   Yet the importance of this room is enormous--one cannot enter that room without
having a feeling about what happens in it. This is where our most precious rights
                                      158

and freedoms are protected through the decisions of the justices of the Supreme
Court--the right to free speech, the right to practice one's faith, the right to a jury
of one's peers and to due process, the right to vote. Nowhere on the face of the globe
or in the history of mankind has a nation guaranteed such liberties.

  It is no wonder that this place evokes such powerful feelings, and it is no wonder
that the American people place so much importance on the naming of a person to
take a seat behind the bench in this courtroom.

  You have been nominated to be one of the nine persons who will question and
debate and judge in this room as one of the final arbiters of the meaning and appli-
cation of the Constitution of the United States and the basic freedoms of us all. You
follow in the path of names like John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Homes, Jr., Louis
D. Brandeis, Hugo L. Black and Thurgood Marshall. Very large shoes to fill, to be
sure. But we must hold such expectations of you. As a justice of the Supreme Court,
if you shirk from protecting these freedoms, we have nowhere else to turn. I call
upon you, if confirmed, to be a beacon of freedom and common sense.

  Like other members of the Committee, I have reviewed your record extensively
over these past weeks. I have been struck by its breadth and distinction. You are
one of our nation's most distinguished circuit judges. You are an accomplished legal
scholar. You are without question a person with the legal acumen necessary to sit
on the Supreme Court.

  But you are more than that, and your nomination means more than that. An es-
sential, but sometimes overlooked, attribute of any judge is that he or she be fair.
Justice requires that all litigants, regardless of their cause, can present their case
and have it decided on the basis of the facts and the law, not on any predisposition
of a particular judge hearing the case. My sense from reviewing your record is that
you are fair--you take each case individually and decide it on its merits under the
law. You do not prejudge the outcome on the basis of an existing notion or narrow
political goal.

  If you are confirmed, I will have participated in confirmations for each of the nine
justices serving on the High Court. During the last 20 years we have had different
sorts of presidents and different sorts of nominations to the Supreme Court. Some
presidents have used Supreme Court nominees as a wedge to divide the American
people--to promote an "us" versus "them" politics. Often these types of nominations
nave resulted in divisive battles, political pontificating, and intensely personal at-
tacks during the confirmation process.

  President Clinton has taken a different course. He has sought a nominee who can
bring people of diverse views together and who has been near universally praised
as an excellent candidate. President Clinton has chosen someone who people of all
stripes--conservatives, liberals, whatever--know will provide them a fair hearing
and a fair reading of the law. The President should be commended for selecting a
person who can help forge our way into a new century and a new age through con-
sensus based in commonly-shared constitutional values.

  Finally, I was struck by some of your comments in the days that your nomination
was first announced. You said that the law has to make practical sense to ordinary
people--it has to accord with real life. I could not agree with you more. I commend
you for writing opinions in a style and manner that is accessible generally rather
than restricted to lawyers or legal scholars. I also commend you for the commitment
you made in your opening statement in these hearings to do your utmost to see that
our decisions reflect both the letter and the spirit of law that is meant to help peo-
ple and to remember the effect your decision will have upon the lives of Americans.

  As a justice, you are charged with making decisions that, quite literally in some
cases, are of life and death significance. The Court is not a place for academic
musings. I hope you will be the kind of justice who focuses on the effect your deci-
sions have on real people--people who may not be powerful or well-connected. I
want you to be the kind of justice who could take the case of Barbara Johns--a
young girl who had to attend a segregated school where classes were held in
tarpaper shacks--and turn it into the unanimous opinion that was Brown v. Board
of Education. I want you to be the kind of justice who would take up Clarence Gid-
eon's habeas petition, scrawled by hand on plain paper, and affirm the right of every
citizen to due process of the law. It is a weighty responsibility.

   I have appreciated hearing your views in these proceedings. Your family is justifi-
ably proud of you and you of them. I hope this has not been a matter of torment
for any of you but an occasion in which you can enjoy participating in a constitu-
tional exercise involving all three branches of our federal government in a most im-
portant function.

  Senator LEAHY. I would like to just mention a couple of things
I say at the end of that statement. When your nomination was first
                                      159
announced, you said during that period that the law has to make
practical sense to ordinary people, it has to accord with real life.
I could not agree with you more, and I commend you, incidentally,
for writing opinions that are in a style and a manner that is acces-
sible generally, rather than just restricted to lawyers or legal schol-
ars.

  I commend you for the commitment you made also in your open-
ing statement today to do your mtmost to see that your decisions
reflect both the letter and the spirit of the law that is meant to
help people, also to remember the effect your decisions are going
to have on the lives of Americans.

  As a Justice, you are going to be charged with making decisions
that quite literally, in some cases, are of life and death significance.
And the court in that regard goes way beyond being a place for
some kind of academic music. So I hope you will be the kind of Jus-
tice who focuses on the effect that your decisions would have on
real people, people who are not very powerful or well-connected.

  I want you to be the kind of Justice who could take the case of
Barbara Jones, a young girl who had to attend segregated schools
where classes were held in tar-paper shacks, a young girl who had
her case go all the way to the Supreme Court, where it became the
unanimous opinion of Brown v. Board of Education, the kind of
Justice who would take up the handwritten, poorly drafted petition
of Clarence Gideon, which indeed was so well-written that Gideon's
trumpet was heard and affirmed the right of every citizen due proc-
ess of the law. And that is a weighty responsibility.

  So I am glad to have heard your views in these proceedings. Your
family has had to sit through all of this. They perhaps heard you
express these views before on more than one occasion.

  It is interesting, because of television and the media covering
this, that the American people probably have a better view of who
you are than they would have otherwise. In that regard, I might
ask, when they do see a judge or a Justice at these kinds of hear-
ings, sometimes it is the only time they ever really get to see them.
They read a little bit about the Supreme Court and arguments. We
hear that some judges are very good in their questioning, and some
tend to pontificate, some go to the point, some appear to do legal
games with the lawyers, and so on. But nobody really knows, un-
less you are actually sitting there.

  What do you think about having television in the Supreme Court
for arguments? Would you be in favor of that?

  Judge BREYER. I would say this, Senator: The issue came up in
the Judicial Conference of the United States, of which I was a
member. They have representatives of all the circuits and also the
district courts. And I voted in favor of that. We voted to have tele-
vision, the question was the court of appeals and the district
courts, and we would run an experimental program. It has been
going on now in the district courts and also in the courts of ap-
peals. I volunteered our first circuit, with the concurrence of the
other judges, for the program, but we were not accepted as the ex-
perimental circuit.

  So I have expressed a view that that is appropriate in that way
in the Judicial Conference. Now, I should add that before making
any decision in the Supreme Court of the United States, if that
                                      160
issue arose. Obviously, I would listen to other members of the court
and try to understand their points of view and what they were
thinking, too.

  Senator LEAHY. I understand, but I applaud you for the feeling
you have, because I think that the court, like every part of the gov-
ernment, should be as accessible as possible, and that is one way
of making it accessible. Nobody asked that these cameras be in in
camera discussion or in chamber discussions where you might be
determining how you are going to vote, but certainly in the argu-
ments.

  Judge, I grew up in a family where the idea of the first amend-
ment was greatly respected, both parts of it. My parents had a
printing business and a weekly newspaper and also held their reli-
gion very deeply. So let me go first to that part of the first amend-
ment dealing with speech.

  Do you think there is a core political speech that is entitled to
greater constitutional protection than other forms of speech?

  Judge BREYER. There is a core of political speech, but it is not
the only thing at the core. It seems to me that there are a cluster
of things that are at the core of the first amendment, including ex-
pression of a person as he talks, as he creates, and also including
what I think of as a dialogue in a civilized society. What do I mean
by that? Actually, it is Michael, my son, who really gave me a good
compliment once that sat me thinking about this. I don't always
get compliments from him.

  What he said was, well, we did used to argue a lot at the dinner
table, I mean discuss, and he said, "You know," he said, "I always
felt you were listening to me." That, of course, doesn't always mean
we agree. But, you see, there is something in that idea of listening
that promotes the dignity of the person who is listened to.

  I have noticed in court sometimes, if there are two people argu-
ing, I will listen and then I try to repeat the argument in my own
words to the other side. As you go back and forth, it promotes a
good feeling, because people feel they have been listened to, even
if you disagreed with them. You took in what they were saying.

  Now, that kind of conversation that has to do with dignity and
the way that the democracy functions, the expressive vale of
speech, the political value of free speech, all of those things are a
cluster of things. Then, as you move out sort of from that center
in different ways, you can discover that some of those things are
mixed with more conduct or some of those things are mixed with
activity that could cause a lot of harm. That was Holmes' point,
you can't yell fire in a crowded theater.

  You could find it in some areas that the expressive value and the
political value is totally gone and there is nothing. Think of child
pornography. But I mean at that core there are several things.

  Senator LEAHY. But do you protect nonpolitical speech like, say,
a scientific debate?

  Judge BREYER. Of course.
  Senator LEAHY. And art and literature?
  Judge BREYER. Of course.
  Senator LEAHY. Let me go into another area, then, as we follow
this a little bit. I have been both a prosecutor and a defense attor-
                                         161

ney. You are brought up to believe you try your cases in the court
room.

  But it seems to me--and we have had of recent days even more
of an example of this, where you have witnesses in a high-profile
criminal case that are going to be out selling their story to tabloids
or television or whatever else before they even go in to testify. They
are obviously telling their story not under oath, but they have sold
it for a great deal of money, and then they are expected to come
in under oath, and certainly it is going to be awkward for them to
contradict what they have just sold it for, and sometimes, as we
have discovered, those buying it want to make sure that it is as
spectacular as possible. A suggestion has been made that some-
times stories are changed to accommodate that.

  I wonder if this kind of checkbook journalism undercuts the pur-
suit of justice or witnesses' credibility, or what it does to the ten-
sion between the first amendment rights and the rights of the pub-
lic and the defendant to a fair trial. What would you think of the
constitutionality of a statute that would prohibit persons identified
as witnesses at a preliminary hearing or a trial from selling their
stories prior to the time they testify? Could you write such a stat-
ute?

  Judge BREYER. I am not going to be or am I in Congress. I under-
stand the difficulty that your question is getting at. I have two re-
actions. Obviously, I cannot discuss the legality of that particular
thing, because that could come up. But underlying your question,
it seems to me that there are two important points.

  The first is what you hone in specifically is likely to be a problem
over the next 20 years, 30 years, maybe indefinitely, where you
have two important sets of rights that all Americans value. All
Americans value free speech. All Americans value the important
right to a trial that is fair, so that an innocent person is not con-
victed. Sometimes those rights can clash, and then you are in a dif-
ficult area of how you are going to reconcile. Now, that is fairly
well known, I suppose.

  The other point that I would like to emphasize--and this is a lit-
tle self-serving, as a judge--is also, as you recognize, not every
clash of this sort need be resolved in a court. That is, I have always
thought that the press, too, is sensitive to the problems of fair trial.
I have always thought that lawyers, too, are sensitive to the prob-
lems of free press. And sometimes that kind of communication--
this is things I have said in speeches, I am not saying anything
new that I have not said before--sometimes that communication
among groups outside of courts, before creating a legal issue out of
everything, can help.

  Those are the only two general comments which may be fairly
obvious.

   Senator LEAHY. Let me pursue that in a different way. I am not
going to ask you to write a statute for us on this, assuming that
one is needed, and then pass on its constitutionality. I also under-
stand what you are saying is the bar and the press could spend
some time and talk with each other, but I must suggest that there
has not been evidence of overwhelming restraint on either side. As
we end up with more and more television networks and more and
more newspapers trying for the next headline, I think the kind of
                                      162
restraint we may talk about may be discussed at prestigious panels
of either press associations or bar associations, and the discussion
will be forgotten the first time there is competition for a story.

  Let me use a corollary of a case that you have been involved in,
In re Globe Newspapers in the first circuit in 1990. As I recall, in
that one, there was a question of whether the press would be ac-
corded access to the names and addresses of trial jurors. Judge
Campbell had noted the clash and constitutionally protected inter-
ests, the press' first amendment right to access to a criminal trial,
a defendant's right to a fair trial, but also the jurors' interests in
having their privacy protected, all major interests.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. What kind of thinking went on? What kind of is-
sues went on in your mind and the others, as you were discussing
how to rule on that case? Or what do you see as the important is-
sues in ruling on that case?
  Judge BREYER. Eventually, the case I think turned on a rule of
court, and it was how to interpret that particular rule, and I think
the Globe got the names because of the rule, if I am remembering
it correctly. But the considerations there are those that you identi-
fied.
  You certainly do not want to close the courts off to the press. The
courts belong to the public. It is a public forum. It is a public
arena. The court is their court, the public's court. It is not the
judges' court and it is not the lawyers' court. And that openness
creates a confidence in the public that I think is necessary to main-
tain the institution.
  At the same time, as you have just pointed out, remember that
a juror, my goodness, what a public service a juror performs. And
you see jurors and they are proud of being jurors. They do not get
paid anything significant.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU also see jurors in some criminal cases terri-
fied to be jurors, too.
  Judge BREYER. Well, it is an amazing thing, if you think about
it, that the public will give willingly that time and commitment to
this kind of important public matter. And what might they sac-
rifice? A lot--money, perhaps privacy, perhaps a great deal of time,
perhaps a long absence from work. And it can even happen that
they are absent for a long time from their families, and they may--
it depends on the case--it could even happen they have to be
locked up in a hotel room for a very long time, which can be very
isolating.
  That is an amazing public service, and I think, as well, that has
to be recognized. So that is in the mind of the judges who are try-
ing to interpret this rule, and that is why Judge Campbell said
that. Eventually, you have to balance those things. Eventually, it
is a question of recognizing the juror's right, recognizing the need
to run the trial fairly, recognizing the importance of having the
proceeding public and maintaining the confidence of the general
public. Those are certainly the considerations, and working them
out is a matter of judgment, what the rule says, how these dif-
ferent factors play out in the context of a particular case. That is
simply to say it is difficult.
  Senator LEAHY. It is also saying there are no absolutes either.
                                      163
  Judge BREYER. There are not. There are not.
  Senator LEAHY. If the Government is giving out Federal funds
for whatever--art, libraries, so on--can they require recipients of
Federal funds to express only those views that the Government
finds acceptable?
  Judge BREYER. If you put it like that, it does not sound likely.
I mean it does not sound that they could.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me give you a couple of examples. Could
the Government--and I have asked this of other nominees--to fur-
ther a policy of protecting the public from sexually explicit mate-
rial, prohibit a library receiving Federal funds from making books
like Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" or J.D. Salinger's "Catcher
in the Rye" available?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, and, you see, then you get into very--you get
into more difficult questions. Of course, one is against censorship,
and you can start with very easy cases. Could they say no books?
We are paying for statues for Party A, Democrats, but not for Re-
publicans; or Party B, Republicans, not for Democrats. Could you
discriminate in that way? And the answer, I think 99.99 percent
of all people would say certainly not.
  And then you get into more difficult areas, and you have on the
one hand the ability of the Government to structure its own pro-
grams. After all, if you are going to have statues and that is your
program, you do not have to pay for paintings because it is a statue
program not a painting program. And then you get into all kinds
of middle cases
  Senator LEAHY. Well, that is easy. That is easy when you say it
only applies to statues or only applies to paintings.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. But within the statues, shall we say we can only
have statues of political figures that are acceptable?
  Judge BREYER. Yes; where, of course, I am tending to agree with
you
  Senator LEAHY. And if we are going to give books, can we start
saying: However, we will give you a list of books that you are not
allowed to buy?
  Judge BREYER. In principle, in principle, censorship is undesir-
able. It is undesirable. And when actual cases of censorship come
up, typically it is going to be some issue which is a borderline
issue. And on this borderline issue, you typically decide it in read-
ing the briefs, reading the arguments, thinking about the particu-
lar case and what the particular thing is. And the reason that I an-
swer it in this way is I think that cases will come up like this, and
I will have to think about it, and
  Senator LEAHY. Could I suggest that you may want to think--
this is just the view of one Vermonter, that the further you move
away from the first amendment being an absolute, the more of
those cases you are going to have?
  Judge BREYER. Well, that is right. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. Suppose the Government wants to protect the in-
tegrity of the Internet or new computer superhighway? Can they
prevent computer users from sending each other a copy of "The
Shipping News" by Annie Proux? I only mention that because an-
other Vermonter did.
                                      164
  Judge BREYER. YOU see, what is at the bottom of it, it does seem
to me--and people forget that, that it is there to protect speech and
writing that we do not agree with. And how often people say, oh,
it is not there to protect that. That is too bad, that is--but that is
what it is there for. And that principle, I think, is exhibited in lots
and lots of different ways. And I think that is a fairly absolute
principle.
  Senator LEAHY. I have been impressed by the current Court's ad-
herence to free speech issues, and somewhat surprised, I might
say. But I would also suggest that the first amendment gives us
the guarantees of diversity that makes us such a strong democracy.
And it is having to put up now and then with speech, or art, or
whatever you or I might find offensive, which guarantees that that
diversity stays there, and the same diversity that protects you and
me.
  Let's speak of the Lemon test. Correct me if I am wrong, but
from your earlier questions, I would assume that you do not feel
we should be out there applying the Lemon test, that there may
be a better test. Am I correct in that?
  Judge BREYER. I do not know if there is a test--I mean, usually
in court cases there are so often two different problems. One is the
problem of what is this line you try to work out what the correct
result is. And then the next question, which is tied into the first,
is: How do you communicate the result? How do you communicate
it to lots of other judges and lawyers and people who have to live
with the rules?
  One way of communicating it is creating a lot of sub-rules, but
there are other ways to communicate the idea. One of the best
ways of all in this area I call a metaphor, the town meeting. As
soon as you say an opinion, it is a New England town meeting.
There are rules. Everyone knows you can have some rules. Every-
one knows the town meeting runs with rules of procedure, but not
rules that choke off points of view. That metaphor is an awfully
good way of communicating things.
  And so when I read a Supreme Court opinion, I wonder if they
have an absolute, you know, sort of sounding test. Maybe what is
meant is that these are indicia that normally work. You can use
a lot of ways of communicating.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, for example, would you use the same test
if you had education regulations, for example, which might affect
parochial schools? Would you apply the same rule to that as you
would rules of speech that might cover religious topics? Would you
not see the possibility that you may be applying a different test in
those cases?
  Judge BREYER. The difficult is, of course, you start in this area
with the basic idea that the State is neutral. No one wants to see
the Government favoring a different religion. And as long as you
do not want to see the Government favoring a different religion,
that means the Government cannot favor your religion either.
  Then no one says that it is absolute. No one believes that the or-
dinary services--fire department, police, many, many such serv-
ices--are not available to religious institutions as well. Of course
they are.
                                      165
  And then the question is: Where do you draw the line? How
much can the Government do without treading--without crossing
that barrier and creating the kind of favoritism that the establish-
ment clause was designed to prevent?
  That is where I start in the way I think about it.
  Senator LEAHY. I listened to your answers to the questions that
Senator Hatch asked, which were very valid and good questions. I
have always read the first amendment, the establishment clause,
as saying that it does set up the way the State must remain neu-
tral between one religion and another and that it guarantees us
our right to practice our religion. But I also read it as saying it
guarantees our right not to practice a religion, if we want.
  Judge BREYER. That is true, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU said that the State should not side with one
religion over another.
  Judge BREYER. Or a religion
  Senator LEAHY. Would you also agree the State should not side
with those who practice religion over those who are nonadherents
to any religion?
  Judge BREYER. I think that is basic. The Supreme Court has, I
think, been very clear about that. Very clear.
  Senator LEAHY. We have the Kiryas Joel Village School District
that tried different ways to provide special education programs to
the handicapped children of a religious community. They tried spe-
cial education classes in an annex to the religious school. That was
stopped in reaction to a 1985 Supreme Court decision. They tried
busing. They tried a special school district, finally, and the Su-
preme Court said this violated the establishment clause.
  Do we need a clearer direction from the Court about what gov-
ernmental accommodation of religion is constitutionally permis-
sible, or is Kiryas Joel as clear as we need?
  Judge BREYER. I start and we do start with the basic accepted
principle that the Supreme Court makes clear the basic about fa-
voritism, as you point out, not favoring one religion over another,
not favoring religion over nonreligion. At the same time, you begin
with the idea as well that certainly religious schools and religious
churches and synagogues are certainly entitled to basic State pro-
tection. And then you are infinitely going to find all these different
cases, have they pushed it too far? Have they pushed it too far?
  And I wish I had a magic formula that would answer that, and
I do not have it. I do not have it.
  Senator LEAHY. I have a feeling
  Judge BREYER. I think it will
  Senator LEAHY. I have a feeling you are going to be grappling
with it for years to come. There are some who want a very literal,
narrow aspect of the establishment clause simply saying that you
can do anything you want as long as you do not actually set up a
State religion, the Government religion, or simply set it there to
prevent Government--well, at the time it was written, from favor-
ing one Christian sect over another.
  Would you say that it goes further than simply prohibiting the
coercion of a State religion?
  Judge BREYER. I think that is well established. Well established.
                                      166
  Senator LEAHY. On the constitutional right to privacy, do you
recognize such?
  Judge BREYER. I think that is well recognized. I think that is
well established in the law.
  Senator LEAHY. Where are the unenumerated rights such as the
right of privacy? Are those in the 9th amendment, 4th amendment,
14th amendment?
  Judge BREYER. That is a very good question, and I have thought
about it some. I do not think it is in the ninth amendment, but it
is true that Justice Goldberg wrote an opinion about the ninth
amendment.
  Senator LEAHY. That is why I ask.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; and he said in that opinion that what the
ninth amendment does is this--it is interesting, I think, if I can
take a minute. Do you want me to
  Senator LEAHY. Sure; I would love to--I did not ask the question
just as an academic exercise. It is something that is a real issue
to me.
  Judge BREYER. It says, 'The enumeration in the Constitution of
certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others re-
tained by the people."
  Now, what does that mean? Well, what he wrote in that was that
it is meant to prevent a certain kind of argument. This is the argu-
ment. You go back. Actually, I had read at Senator Hatch's sugges-
tion an article that was quite interesting on this point. Go back to
the Framers. They thought that they had delegated limited powers
to the central Government. Therefore, that is all you needed. You
see, the central Government could not trample people's free speech
or religion because they did not have the power to do it.
  But others said do not trust that. You better have a Bill of
Rights, and in that Bill of Rights you better say specifically that
the central Government cannot do that, cannot trample people's
free speech or religion.
  The first group then said, wait a minute, you better be careful.
Once you write that Bill of Rights, people are going to get up and
argue that everything that you did not put in there, they could run
out and do. No, no. Here is what we will do, they all decided. We
will put in the ninth amendment, and the ninth amendment will
make very clear to everybody that just because we have not said--
just because we have that Bill of Rights and we have said certain
things--speech, religion, press--do not take our statement there as
meaning nothing else is important. Do not take our statement
there as meaning nothing else exists.
  So there was a view in the Supreme Court for a while, really as-
sociated with Justice Black, that the only rights that were pro-
tected against the States' infringing them were those specifically
listed in the first eight amendments and the word "liberty" in the
14th meant only those listed in the first eight, all of them and no
others. But, said Justice Goldberg, your argument is doing just
what the ninth amendment told you not to do. So do not argue that
way. And once you do not argue that way, then you look at that
word "liberty" in the 14th amendment, and you say it is designed
to protect fundamental rights.
                                      167

  People have described those fundamental rights in many dif-
ferent ways. There are a variety of approaches to figuring out what
they are. Almost every Supreme Court Justice since then has ac-
cepted the existence of some, and what they are and how you find
them is a big question.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. In the meantime, there was the incorporation
doctrine.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S.
                     SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to have my opening statement
inserted into the record.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley follows:]

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY

  Congratulations on your nomination to the Supreme Court, Judge Breyer. It is
readily apparent that your nomination developed from the reputation you have es-
tablished over many years as a law professor and judge.

  Your writings and legal opinions appear to reflect an understanding of the proper
place of the Supreme Court, and courts generally, in our society. I find your ap-
proach to deciding cases to remind me of Justice Frankfurter. Time and again, when
asked to find statutes unconstitutional, you have examined the language and legis-
lative intent, and resolved all legitimate questions in favor of constitutionality. This
deference to the legislature is a hallmark ofjudicial restraint.

  In recent decades, too many judges have permitted political considerations of de-
sired policy results to affect their legal conclusions. These decisions are based on
the view that the Constitution, rather than guaranteeing specific rights, broadly
protects judicially-defined liberty and dignity. More recently, the Court has focused
more on legal principles, rather than personal preference. There are those who may
hope that their policy goals, unattainable through the political process, can be ob-
tained through your vote on the Supreme Court. Your record as a judge thus far
gives little support to such hopes. Nonetheless, as a Supreme Court Justice, you will
not be constrained to follow precedent to the same extent as a Federal judge.

  The legitimacy of judicial review derives from the power to enforce the Constitu-
tion as supreme law. When judges impose their own personal views, they nec-
essarily do not apply the law. The basis for judicial review evaporates in these cir-
cumstances, and our limited government of laws becomes a government of people.

   I hope to explore with you during your testimony issues relating to the role of
judges and important principles of constitutional and statutory decisionmaking. I
am not looking for campaign promises, but I do hope to determine your judicial phi-
losophy.

  Judge Breyer, your objectivity, adherence to the Constitution, and your awareness
of the limited power of judges and the appropriate role of the branches elected to
decide policy questions are important. I look forward to addressing these issues with
you during these hearings.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Breyer, I am glad to hear you say in
your previous discussion with Senator Leahy that child pornog-
raphy is not protected speech. You dealt with child pornography
when you served on the Sentencing Commission, and you were
making guidelines for violation of the child pornography statutes.
There was a January 1987 meeting when one of the Commis-
sioners, Judge MacKinnon, suggested adding an aggravating factor
to the crime of transporting, receiving, or trafficking in child por-
nography. He proposed increasing the sentence when the large
sums of money often correlated with organized crime involvement
in child pornography were present. And he made a motion to raise
                                         168

the base sentence by four levels, where the retail value of the ex-
ploitative material exceeded $25,000. It passed by a 5-to-l vote.

  The one vote against the motion was yours. I am sure you had
very good reasons. Could you give me the reasons why you were
the sole dissenter in a decision to impose tough sentences on the
very worst child pornography producers and peddlers?

  Judge BREYER. YOU have to understand, Senator--well, let me
think about it for a second. I am thinking of the best way to ex-
plain what I am guessing now I was doing then.

  It is unlikely that you can find merit in child pornography. Writ-
ing those sentencing guidelines was tough. It was very tough. The
reason it was tough, in part, was because the seven Commissioners
had very different views about which was the best or the worst or
the medium or the best behavior or what the sentences should be
for very different kinds of crimes.

  So in order to create an approach, what I tried to do was this:
I tried to say, with others' agreement, here is what we will do, and
this gets rid of our subjective approach. Let's not try to get the
right order of what is worse with what. If we do that, we will be
disagreeing all the time. Let's do this. Let's get, with the help of
10,000 presentence reports analyzed in depth and 25,000 others
analyzed in less depth, let's get a picture of how the sentencing
system really has worked up until this point in 1987. And then
what we will try to do is we will try to create sentences that mirror
typical past practice, and we will try our best not to stray from
that typical past practice. Sometimes we will modify, but we will
have to have a very good reason.

  Now, that was a principle that allowed us to write the guidelines.
And as a person, as a person who pushed that principle, who felt
it was an important principle, I had to live up to it myself, irrespec-
tive of how I might feel about the particular crime. So if, in fact,
that typical past practice showed that whatever the sentence there
was, I would resist people putting add-ons or subtractions or what-
ever they were, no matter how I felt about the underlying crime,
because I was trying to maintain a principle. And, of course, if I
deviate from that principle myself, everybody else will start to devi-
ate, and, gosh, it is sort of difficult to know where it is going to
end up.

  So I tended in those guideline meetings to resist what I would
call ad hoc changes, even though that ad hoc change might have
been something that, from a policy point of view, would have been
very good. And that is what I think you see reflected there.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU saw Judge MacKinnon's motion to be ex-
traordinary, then.

  Judge BREYER. I would say probably it reflected a view that this
is a very, very bad crime. And I would have shared that view. It
is a very, very bad crime.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I want to now talk with you about precedent
on the Supreme Court. You have different considerations, obvi-
ously, than you will as an appellate judge, where you have been for
14 years. I want to relate it to a public policy issue that we deal
with here in Congress and will be dealing with more in the future.
And if you will bear with me, let's talk about one line of Supreme
Court cases as it relates to these policy issues.
                                      169

  During the 1960's and 1970's, the Supreme Court issued a series
of opinions striking down statutes that treated differently children
born to married parents as opposed to children born out of wedlock.
The Court also rejected differing treatments based on whether the
out-of-wedlock child had been acknowledged through a subsequent
marriage of the parents. These decisions, as you will recall, rejected
differentiations in welfare benefits between the two situations.

  The Court did not find that the State's interest in preserving and
strengthening family life or protecting families from dissolution or
discouraging bringing children into the world out of wedlock was
sufficiently legitimate to justify these distinctions that the States
had set up. Instead, the Court found that only moral prejudice
could justify differential treatment, particularly since children
could not affect their status. Such statutes were called in the Weber
case illogical and unjust.

  Instead, the Court focused on the needs of children for these ben-
efits, and it found no rational basis for believing that illegitimacy
would increase if some of these statutes were struck down. So the
Court did strike them down.

  We now know, 20 to 30 years later, that the Court was a very
poor forecaster of future social environment. As you probably know,
the Court said that it was--and this is again from the Weber case--
powerless to prevent the social opprobrium suffered by these hap-
less children. And, of course, as we look back now, at least from
my perspective, the Court was just plain wrong on what they saw
to be the results of these decisions.

  Today there is hardly any stigma in any place. In many places,
there is no stigma in having out-of-wedlock births. A major reason
for this is that societal disapproval of the practice can no longer be
expressed through law, thanks to these cases that are involved.

  To some extent, the Court reflected as well as affected social
opinion. But the fact is that the Court, through these decisions, has
played a role in bringing about far-reaching negative changes to-
ward society. For instance, in 1970, the percentage of out-of-wed-
lock births was 10 percent; now it is 30 percent. Young people from
single-parent families are two to three times more likely to have
emotional or behavioral problems than those from intact families.
They also face higher risk of child abuse and neglect, poor perform-
ance in school, having children on their own as teenagers, what is
called kids having kids, you know, having their own marriages end
in divorce, and a six times greater risk of being poor.

  The absence of parents frequently leads to both illegitimacy and
welfare dependency for a series of generations. Males born out of
wedlock are much more likely to engage in criminal activity than
their counterparts born to married parents, particularly if they live
in neighborhoods that have a high concentration of single-parent
families.

  So, finally, Judge Breyer, State legislatures and Congress are
trying to respond to this, very much in a bipartisan fashion now.
It kind of makes you wonder how you could get so much unanimity
all at one time. These legislatures, and even we in Congress, have
decided that action is quickly needed to reduce illegitimacy and its
attendant negative social consequences.
                                      170
  In seeking to address the problem, these legislatures and the
Congress do run the risk that if the Supreme Court follows its cur-
rent jurisprudence, many possible reforms could still be unconstitu-
tional. Now, one of the reasons the Supreme Court has given for
overruling decisions in the past--and I am speaking generally
about decisions, not just about this line of cases--is that facts have
so changed or come to be seen so differently as to have robbed the
old rule of significant application or justification.
  If a case were before you raising whether certain of the Court's
decisions involving illegitimacy should be overturned, would the so-
cietal changes that have developed over the last 30 years be rel-
evant to your decision? Now, I am not asking you how you would
rule in a certain specific case. I am just trying to get a feel from
you whether you would consider these changed facts in reaching
your decision.
  Judge BREYER. They are relevant. I think they are relevant. I
think that in applying the Constitution in general, one looks, of
course, to the conditions of society. I think the Constitution is a set
of incredibly important, incredible valuable principles, statements
in simple language that have enabled the country to exist for 200
years, and I hope and we believe many hundreds of years more.
  That Constitution could not have done that if, in fact, it was not
able to have words that drew their meaning in part from the condi-
tions of the society that they govern. And, of course, the conditions
and changed conditions are relevant to deciding what is and what
is not rational in terms of the Constitution, as in the terms of a
statute or in any other rule of law.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I think I am reading you that you would have
an open mind.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I would.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes; and I think that is pretty important be-
cause the President who nominated you, President Clinton, liberals
in Congress, conservatives in Congress, are looking for solutions to
the problem of the breakup of the family and strengthening the
family. We see these trends of the last several years as very, very
bad, and you may have some cases sometime that would cause you
to look at these records and these facts that precede this now.
  I appreciate very much that you would see having an open mind
on that issue.
  I would like to go now to the use of legislative history. You and
I, I think, share a similar view on the use of legislative history in
the interpretation of statutes, unlike, for instance, the way I view
Justice Scalia not wanting to look at legislative history. You have
written Law Review articles about it, and from a reading of your
cases, I can also see that you are willing to rely on legislative his-
tory.
  I want to discuss one of your cases as an example, U.S. v.
Maravilla. I think it is a good example of your use of legislative
history. I want to discuss it and then explore with you whether
there are limits to the use of legislative history.
  In Maravilla, you examined whether civil rights law applied to
a temporary visitor to the United States. That was a case where
two U.S. Customs officers had kidnapped a money launderer from
the Dominican Republic. They stole his money and killed him. They
                                      171
were charged with a variety of crimes, although there was not a
Federal murder statute applicable. Included in the charges was a
violation of the civil rights law that covered inhabitants of the
United States.

  You made a very thorough analysis of the statute, including re-
viewing the legislative history of the law, and concluded that the
courier did not fall within the law's protection. Briefly, what role
did legislative history play in your analysis, and would this be an
example of how you might use legislative history on the Supreme
Court?

  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes is the answer. Briefly, it is a word. The
word was inhabitant. It does not, obviously, in any obvious way, de-
scribe a person who comes to the United States for a few hours.
Yet the civil rights laws are supposed to offer broad protection, and
it is not absolutely out of the question. So how do you know what
the people who passed that law really had in mind. The only way
is to understand the context in which the statute arose and what
the human being who wrote that word into the statute was think-
ing about. And if that was a staff person, which it would not have
been at that time, but if it was now the staff person as acting with
the knowledge of what the Senator believes is important and what
those views are, and, therefore, what one is trying to get at is what
does the Senator think about this.

  Now, of course, sometimes that is all very controversial, and
sometimes what has happened in some cases is what Judge
Leventhal used to describe. He said, oh, it is like going to a cocktail
party and looking over the crowd and picking out your friends.
What he is describing is a misuse of legislative history.

  Very often, by going into those debates, you can get a pretty good
idea of what they had in mind, the Senators who passed that, and
I think that is what--and I hope it is a good use of it. I hope you
find it a good use of it. But that is the kind of thing I would tend
to do. That is the kind of thing I do.

  Senator GRASSLEY. This term the Supreme Court decided
Langrafv. USI Film. It was an 8-to-l decision. In that decision, the
Court reviewed the 1991 Civil Rights Act and found that it was not
retroactive.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. The case involved a woman who claimed she
was a victim of sexual harassment. She quit her job after her har-
asser was disciplined, and then she sued the company. The Court
found the harassment did not justify her resignation, and she was
not entitled to any relief under title VII.
  While her appeal was pending, Congress enacted the 1991 Civil
Rights Act, which allows for recovery of damages for pain and suf-
fering. Langraf argued the law was retroactive and that she should
recover damages for pain and suffering, and, of course, the Su-
preme Court, 8 to 1, disagreed. First, the Court found the statute
did not contain a clear expression of retroactivity. Second, the
Court reviewed legislative history, and that is the point I want to
bring up here, finding it to be inconclusive and even conflicting on
the issue of retroactivity.
  The Court relied upon the canons of statutory construction,
which included a presumption against retroactivity. So if I could
                                      172
follow up with you on a discussion that you had with Senator
Biden this morning, what happens when a judge has to look at con-
flicting statements by Members of Congress, all of whom say that
they are supporting the law? It probably makes your job very dif-
ficult, right?

  Judge BREYER. Yes; that is the art. That is the art, and you can-
not always get it right, either. And where it is conflicting, some-
times it is absolutely inconclusive. But it helps. It helps to try
through reading the documents, recognizing that this is a world in
which you do not come here with a quill pen and your briefcase.
A labor union does not operate just with one person, nor does a
business. And there are many people involved in the legislative
process that ultimately the policy decisions are yours.

  And what the Court is trying to do in reading legislative history
is, through reading this entire record, hearings if necessary, back
to finding out where the words originated, looking at the floor de-
bates, is to do its best--which will not always be right, but to do
its best to identify the human purposes. And usually there are two
or three several different ones that identify the basic purposes that
are driving you. And often, but not always, that gives a key to the
correct interpretation of the statute.

  Senator GRASSLEY. What does it say about Congress' willingness
to kind of punt to the judiciary what might be a tough legislative
decision?

  Judge BREYER. Sometimes Congress will.
  Senator GRASSLEY. It probably says we are shirking our respon-
sibility.
  Judge BREYER. Well, normally, you know, I think it is pretty
common, and if you punt to a regulatory agency, the executive
branch filling in the interstices is pretty common. If you want, I
mean, I think it is risky.
  Senator GRASSLEY. SO you would say that there is a limit to the
Court's reliance upon legislative history.
  Judge BREYER. Of course there is a limit. There are some prob-
lems it just does not solve. But I think it is helpful, I think it is
helpful, and obviously, from what I
  Senator GRASSLEY. Congress cannot hide behind a statute by giv-
ing it to the courts to make a tough decision instead of our doing
it during the drafting process.
  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator GRASSLEY. In fact, in Langraf, the Court said it would
not permit uncertainty in litigation if Congress has not specified
whether a statute is to apply retroactively. Many of my colleagues
on this committee, and I as well, have worked over the last number
of years to get Congress to be clear in drafting by stating whether
or not the law was intended to be retroactive, whether or not we
were trying to apply a private right of action, whether or not we
preempted State laws. Quite frankly, we have not been very suc-
cessful in getting our colleagues to do that. But now the Langraf
decision achieves some of what I think we have been trying to do.
  The Supreme Court stated that it will hold Congress to a clear
statement rule of statutory construction. If Congress clearly states
in the text of the law that it is to apply retroactively, then and only
then will the Court enforce it retroactively. If Congress is ambigu-
                                      173
ous, then the Court will apply a default rule that the statute would
apply only prospectively.

  What do you think of the Supreme Court's adoption of the clear
statement rules?

  Judge BREYER. Well, I do not know about that particular case or
not, or others that might come up. I think it is preferable, as I have
written, that Congress just directly deal with the issue rather than
the Supreme Court having various clear-statement rules, because
those become all these different canons. And what I said as a kind
of joke at one point, I said, well, you know, you can have canons
to the left of them, canons to the right of them. I mean, it is very
hard for people to draft and to understand what legislation is really
going to turn out to be in practice if you have all these canons and
there are dozens of ones and they used to conflict. That makes it--
in a way, canons can make it more difficult for you, it seems to me,
rather than less. It would depend what they were.

  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator would yield, retroactive canons are
particularly difficult.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, you know, as a former staff member of
this committee, you surely had to deal with some of these problems
as well.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. And don't you think it is really better for the
Court to say that if you want us to apply something retroactively,
say so? Isn't that the position Congress should be in, encouraged
to draft as particular a statute as they can?
  Judge BREYER. That particular one--that is why I am hesitant
to comment on a particular one. Maybe that would work. I am not
sure. I have not thought it out.
  What you have when you have like a clear-statement doctrine,
then you have to go in and say what is a clear statement? And then
you will find a case where nobody said anything, but it seems obvi-
ous that it ought to be retroactive.
  You discover all kinds of problems with canons, all kinds of prob-
lems, and ultimately we have a system where--you see, as a staff
person, I always felt that what I am supposed to do in these areas
is identify for the Senator what the policy problems and issues are
and then transmit that to other members of the staff and, through
them, to other Senators. And that process works fairly well. Not
perfectly, but it leads all the people who are affected by legislation
and have representatives or try to get their voices through to you,
they begin to know what to expect. That system does not work per-
fectly, but it is not terrible. And I have expressed a degree of con-
cern about moving to some totally different system which I think
would end up with your voice being less direct and having less ef-
fect and making it harder to understand the human purposes that
move you.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Some people might try to make the case that
it might be the present Supreme Court trying to be a conservative
activist Court, when, in fact, what the Supreme Court maybe is
really trying to do is to say to Congress, do what you were elected
to do, and that is make some tough choices. I think it shows in
Langraf that clear statement rules are not a conservative judicial
activism. Because here is a case where Justice Stevens wrote an
                                      174
opinion setting forth a rule, denying retroactivity to a statue, over-
turning decisions that Stevens previously had dissented in.

  Judge BREYER. Your basic point, I
  Senator GRASSLEY. Getting back to legislative history, there is
another limit. Wouldn't you agree that it is inappropriate for a
judge to use legislative history to reach a result not mandated by
statute? I think you spoke about some inappropriateness.
  Judge BREYER. Sure. Ultimately, you are there with the language
of the statute, and the language of the statute is what governs. You
know, history comes in where it is hard to figure out how it applies
and what it really means, and so forth. But it is not the statute
that is explaining the history. It is the history that is explaining
the statute.
  Senator GRASSLEY. By the way, in that 8-to-l Langraf case, do
you think that you would have been in the majority?
  Judge BREYER. I have not read it with enough thoroughness to
know.
  Senator GRASSLEY. The reason I was asking is that Justice
Blackmun was the one who dissented in that case.
  You have written a lot about legislative veto. I have had a long-
standing interest in that. You find the Chadha decision very sound.
I am not sure that I agree with that, but that does not keep me
from looking to see what can be done. I think you have offered
some very good suggestions for Congress to maintain its check on
agency power.
  If I could draw your attention to the current controversy over
some proposed agency regulations. I use these just as an example,
because eventually these might even get to the Court, and they are
something we have recently dealt with in this committee.
  The EEOC has issued regulations on religious harassment. Many
of us believe that the EEOC has overstepped its boundaries. The
regulations could make any religious expression in the workplace
almost prohibited. But we have no real check on the EEOC's power
to issue regulations, other than our public relations perspective.
  From your writings, it seems to me that you believe it is within
Congress* power to be a firm check on agency power. Would the
EEOC's actions be an illustration of agency power which we here
in the Congress, if we wanted to, could appropriately check?
  Judge BREYER. That would be for you to judge. That would be
for you to judge. My question would be whether there is some way
of--I mean you have a lot of ways of controlling the agencies, obvi-
ously through the appropriations process, through legislation,
through hearings, through letters, through suggestions, through
discussion. There are many, many, many ways in which Congress
has power over the agencies.
  The legislative veto was one way that became popular, that the
agency passed a legislation, if one House vetoed it, that is the end
of it. Then Congress said that was unconstitutional. So I tried in
the article that you were speaking of, to think is there some other
way you could get to the same result, and I think I thought of one
that was not quite the same result, but close. But it is a little com-
plicated.
  Senator GRASSLEY. That is this confirmatory clause?
                                      175

  Judge BREYER. Yes, it was a bit gimmicky, that what you do is
it would take effect only if you passed a law confirming it, but you
would have a rule that it went right on a fast track, not debatable,
and if one House

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU wrote about that 11 years ago. Do you
think you would still feel the same way today in that Georgetown
Law Review article?

  Judge BREYER. It is a suggestion and it would be a suggestion
that I felt was a little gimmicky, and if people in Congress wanted
to do it, it was explained and then it would be entirely be up to
you.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, if Congress could use a provision like
that, it seems to me like it would effectively give Congress some
control over the regulations of an agency like the EEOC. If you still
feel the same way about that now as you did 10 years ago, that
helps me to understand where you are coming from. Do you feel
like you did?

  Judge BREYER. I think it is a possibility.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I assume, though, when you say it is a possi-
bility, that if you wrote in the Georgetown Law Review about a
possible process of what you call confirmatory law, you had given
considerable thought that it was possibly as an appropriate con-
stitutional congressional response to Chadha?
  Judge BREYER. I would stick by what I said.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to point out for the record, Judge,
that Senator Grassley, with each successive hearing, is losing his
credibility in the following sense: He always makes the case that
he is a nonlawyer. He brags about that at home. He knows a heck
of a lot of law, for a nonlawyer, pretty impressive. Soon, no longer
are you going to be able to make the claim, Senator, that you are
a nonlawyer. You are beginning to sound like a lawyer.
  I would also note, before I yield to Senator DeConcini, that I find
it somewhat fascinating--and I would like you to keep this in mind
for tomorrow--that the very Justices that have been before this
committee and are now on the Court who have argued the doctrine
of original intent when interpreting the Constitution are the very
Justices who are the new textualists who argue, when it comes to
a statute, that they do not have to go beyond the words of the stat-
ute to seek intent.
  I have always found that fascinating, how, when looking at the
Constitution, they have concluded that we must go look at the
original intent of the drafters and stick to that, but when looking
at the statute, they look only at the text of the statute and not the
legislative history, which they pore through in order to find con-
stitutional rights, whether they exist or not, but do not pore
through when it comes to looking at the text, which leads me to
the conclusion that all Justices, liberal and conservative, are result-
oriented, whether they know it or not. But that is my prejudice.
  I will yield to Senator DeConcini.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DENNIS DeCONCINI, A U.S.
                 SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
                                      176
  Judge thank you for your understanding this process so well. If
you want to take a break, I am more than happy to wait around,
if necessary. I welcome you here, Judge Breyer, as so many of us
do, because we know you well.
  I believe your experience crosses so many different areas of gov-
ernment, that it is particularly encouraging to see you nominated
by President Clinton for Associate Justice. You have had experi-
ence here, you have had experience in the private sector, you have
had experience in academia. You have been with the executive
branch, you understand accommodation and compromise. You un-
derstand the legislative history, because you wrote much of it when
you were here. You have been in a policy-making role in the execu-
tive branch, which is encouraging, I think.
  You served on the court, and you have had an opportunity to de-
velop a philosophy that I think demonstrates judicial restraint dur-
ing your time on the bench, which I think is very important to this
Senator and many others, as you know. You have a well-rounded
background, and I think that is probably why the President chose
you, as well as being so handsome and articulate and intellectual,
et cetera.
  I am pleased to have chaired the hearings in 1980 when you
were up for confirmation to the first circuit, and you did very well
at that time. Judge Breyer, since I have been on this committee,
this is the eighth Supreme Court Justice that I will have had an
opportunity to have voted on. You will be the eighth one, the first
one being the nomination of Sandra O'Connor of Arizona, the first
woman to serve on the Supreme Court, as you well know. I believe
that nominee was unparalleled in ability and dedication to the
Constitution and real understanding, she also was a judge. This
will be my last nomination. I am sorry I did not get a full house,
I did not get all nine vacancies to vote on, but I am pleased that
I am going to be able to support you.
  Having said that, there are some questions that I would like to
ask primarily for the record, Judge. First of all, I want to turn to
the question of the Boston Courthouse. I do not think we can ig-
nore that beautiful edifice, and indeed it is beautiful. For the
record, all I want is confirmation, if you remember these facts,
Judge.
  The total funding for that building is approximately $220 million,
and that was appropriated over a 3-year period, $184 million in
1991, $23 million in 1993, and another $18.6 million in 1994. Is
that your recollection?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Just for the record, Mr. Chairman, the vote
in 1991 was 93 to 6 on the floor of the Senate appropriating, with
all but six members, including both Senators from Arizona, casting
votes in favor of that appropriation.
  Some may wonder why that was raised. Well, it passed by such
a unanimous vote or nearly unanimous vote, and this action was
taken based on a report of a building project survey prepared by
the General Services Administration, during President Bush's
term, which was submitted to the Congress on January 22, 1990.
If you do not remember that date, I am sure this refreshes your
memory, Judge.
                                      177
  There was some discussion at that time of approximately 400,000
occupiable square feet of a building at a cost of $163 million. That
was signed off by then Acting Administrator, Mr. Austin, who was
later confirmed as the Bush appointee. Subsequently, there were
additional designs to add 100,000 square feet, and I think you had
something to do with that. That 100,000 square feet, was it not pri-
marily to accommodate the U.S. Attorney, and not for additional
court rooms or facilities for the judiciary?
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  Senator DECONCINI. It was for the executive branch, in essence.
Research shows us that the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee did authorize the site and design for the project of $51
million in 1990. In fact, Senator Burdick, then chairman of that
committee, gave me approval to proceed without full authorization
on this courthouse. He was the chairman of the committee, and
said that we could proceed, which we did. Of course, there was also
a vote on that as well.
  The fiscal year 1994 budget prepared by the Bush administration
requested an additional $19 million, and that was appropriated at
$18.6 million. Do you recall that, Judge Breyer?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. And what is that status of that courthouse
now?
  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, it is just going out for bid. I
think it is just going out for bid now.
  Senator DECONCINI. And are you aware that it averages approxi-
mately $5 less than the average courthouse for construction pur-
poses?
  Judge BREYER. I think that is right, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I think for the record it is im-
portant, Judge Breyer, that we understand what these buildings
are. Courthouses are built for long duration, not for the normal life
of a commercial building, is that not correct?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. This building would have a lifetime of well
over 50 years or perhaps 100 years.
  Judge BREYER. I hope a lot longer.
  Senator DECONCINI. And it can accommodate substantial growth,
within your judgment of that court.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge Breyer, turning to the equal protec-
tion clause, I have always had great interest in this subject matter
and have had an opportunity to question a number of nominees.
The equal protection clause and the related cases have played an
integral role in the development of the advancement of women's
equality. I have repeatedly asked nominees about their views on
gender discrimination under this amendment, and I believe that a
nominee must be committed to the principle of gender equality.
  I think I know the answer, but I am going to ask you anyway,
Judge. Although the 14th amendment states that no State shall
"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
the laws," it is generally believed that the authors of the 14th
amendment were concerned with racial discrimination and did not
specifically have women or gender discrimination in mind.
                                      178
  In regard to cases based upon gender, the standard of review is
one of intermediate or heightened scrutiny. Under this standard, a
classification must serve an important governmental objective and
be substantially related to that objective. This standard was devel-
oped over time and has been effective in protecting against gender
discrimination.
  Judge, do you believe that this standard is the proper one for re-
viewing gender related cases, or do you believe any expansion is
necessary at this time?
  Judge BREYER. I am hesitating because of the fact that this is
likely to be before the Court. But I would like to say something,
which is this: It seems to me that it is absolutely established that
gender discrimination falls within the scope of the 14th amend-
ment. That is clearly and totally accepted, I think, across the spec-
trum.
  As I think of the 14th amendment, to speak generally, the 14th
amendment perfected a Constitution that before it lacked some-
thing very important, and that something was a promise of basic
fairness. That promise of basic fairness was not carried out, even
though it was in the Constitution, for many, many years. And ever
since Brown, the country in all of its branches of government has
been trying to make real that promise of fairness.
  It applies to women, too, and to many others. The test that you
are talking about, having a sense of substantive part, and they
have a communications part. The substantive part I might describe
as this: Imagine saying to a minority person there is a rule of law
here that harms you through a discrimination. Wouldn't you, as
soon as you say that, think but what possible justification could
there be? And that I think is what the substance is, when the Su-
preme Court makes its tough test.
  Now think of Chloe or Nell or their equivalents all over the coun-
try going into the workplace, and think of some kind of rule that
makes their life worse because they are women. Wouldn't you say
but what kind of justification for that could there be?
  Now, that it seems to me to be the kind of substance that is pret-
ty widely accepted and going on. Now, the exact way in which that
is communicated through the vast administrative network which is
called the court system through judges to lawyers, to employers, to
others, that I think is a matter of words and those words may be
the subject of litigation. So it seems to me I have to stop with the
statement of general principle.
  Senator DECONCINI. Let me ask you this: In the recent case of
J.E.B. v. Alabama, the Supreme Court used the equal protection
clause to find that gender-based preemptory challenges were un-
constitutional. I realize that you cannot comment on that case, and
I am not suggesting that you should.
  But it appears very clear to me that the Court seems to be mov-
ing closer to applying a strict scrutiny standard in cases of gender
discrimination. Do not worry, I am not going to ask you how you
would rule on that case or any pending cases. But do you believe
in the general sense that the intermediate scrutiny for gender dis-
crimination, do you believe it will always be sufficient to meet po-
tentially hypothetical cases regarding gender discrimination?
                                      179
  Judge BREYER. It may not be, and that will be up for litigation,
and I will read the briefs with care and I will listen to the argu-
ments
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU are not stuck in the intermediate by
any means.
  Judge BREYER. Certainly not. I think those will be argued.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU will approach it from each case.
  Judge BREYER. Those matters will be argued. They do not seem
to me, as I read the cases, to be closed, and there is a communica-
tions problem and there is the substantive problem, and I think of
Chloe and I think of Nell, and that is more or less the
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Breyer.
  Let me turn to another subject. In a recent Supreme Court case,
Liteky v. United States, the Supreme Court held that if the source
of a prejudicial remark is a judicial proceeding or ruling, then dis-
qualification is only necessary if the judge displays a deep-seated
favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impos-
sible. I was very disturbed by that ruling, just parenthetically.
  As you know, current law provides that a judge shall disqualify
himself or herself in any proceedings in which his or her impartial-
ity might reasonably be questioned. In Liteky, the Court seems to
throw out the plain meaning of the statute and creates a very high
standard for litigants to meet, if they want to raise concerns about
a sitting judge.
  This concerns me, Judge Breyer, because the integrity of our en-
tire judicial system rests on the impartiality of our judges, and I
believe that judges must do all they can to win the confidence of
the American people that our system of justice created and pro-
tected by the Constitution is being fairly and objectively adminis-
tered.
  In the United States v. Quesada-Bonilla, you did not believe that
the judge's prejudicial remarks constituted reversible error. What
do you believe is the appropriate standard in reviewing potential
prejudicial comments from the bench? Did you have a standard in
mind, when you made that decision? How did you approach that,
without prejudicing any case that you may have to do? I am inter-
ested in knowing, quite frankly, what a judge thinks. And I have
asked some other judges that same question. They were not under
oath and before this committee, obviously.
  Judge BREYER. In abstract, you think you do not
  Senator DECONCINI. I will accept it as that.
  Judge BREYER. Abstractly, you do not want something that looks
to the public as if it is prejudiced. That is very important. That is
on the one side of it. Now, in actually carrying out the case, think
of the trial judge. The trial judge may have a preliminary proceed-
ing. He may, for example, have to decide probable cause. Well, he
will learn something about the case, and he might make some
statement in respect to, well, there is a lot of cause here, or what-
ever.
  Now, to administer the system, that same person has to be ex-
pected maybe to preside over the trial. Once again, that person
learns a lot about it, and he may make various remarks. Then
there might be a retrial or a sentence, and he will be there again.
So what you are thinking of in trying to decide that case--that is
                                      180
why I find it hard to find a general principle. It awfully much
grows out of the situation. You have to understand the prac-
ticalities of administering a judicial system, what is it really like
to be a trial judge and a lawyer in that, and then you have to see.

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me give you a hypothetical. What if a
judge clearly, undisputably makes an arguable prejudicial state-
ment during the course of a trial?

  Is it sufficient, in your mind, to instruct the jury to disregard
that statement and still sit for the case?

  Judge BREYER. The truthful answer is it depends on the state-
ment and it depends on the trial.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, given the fact that there is just no
question that this was a

  Judge BREYER. If it really prejudiced the trial, out. That is the
end; new trial. If it prejudiced the trial and it is an improper state-
ment

  Senator DECONCINI. SO an instruction would not suffice, in your
judgment, in such a hypothetical?

  Judge BREYER. The reason I am being hesitant is that I think
these things are very fact-specific, and sometimes an instruction
will cure it and sometimes it won't, and so what you do so often
on appeal is you look at that case and you look and see--this is
where the judgment comes in and it is tough, often, but you look
and see, okay, what was the remark; what was the context; to what
extent could it be cured; to what extent, in fact, is a curative in-
struction impossible.

  I have seen cases where it could be cured, I have seen cases
where it couldn't be cured. I have seen cases, I think, in the middle
where I really find it awfully tough. They come in many shapes
and sizes.

  Senator DECONCINI. The problem I have with the Liteky case is
that it appears that the Court says, unless there is a deep-seated
favoritism or antagonism that makes a fair judgment impossible,
you can't disqualify the judge. So, given my hypothetical, just an
arguably prejudicial statement, clearly, without any dispute that it
was that--unless it became a deep-seated favoritism or antag-
onism--an instruction would suffice to the jury and would not be
grounds for disqualifying the judge.

  I don't expect an answer, but that decision, I think, greatly un-
dermines if, in fact, it is strictly enforced, and is, no question about
it, an intimidating factor on members of the bar to raise concerns
over a judge's statements during a trial that might be extremely
prejudicial, but fail to demonstrate a deep-seated favoritism or an-
tagonism.

  Judge, turning to judicial temperament, how do you, with all the
experience you have, manage to keep an even keel after you are on
the Court, given the successes you have had, the fact that everyone
calls you Your Honor and will do just about anything you ask them
to do within the confines of your office? What do you do to attempt
to keep a balance as an individual so you don't feel that you are
somebody other than Steve Breyer, who worked hard and earned
his way to the career he has had? Do you ever think about that?

  Judge BREYER. Yes, I do. I do think about it.
  Senator DECONCINI. What do you do?
                                      181
  Judge BREYER. I find help, of course, from my family in that re-
spect because I wouldn't dare think anything, that I was somehow
preferable with this particular family, and they are helpful.
  But the other thing, and Joanna actually tells me this some-
times, is remember you are sitting there and people up in front of
you are arguing; think of the advantage that you have over them,
be careful. When they make an argument--a person makes an ar-
gument you don't think is too sound, so what? He is being--he is
helping a litigant, he is helping a litigant. That is his job; listen.
  And if people are being flattering or whatever, beware, beware,
and that is where the robe helps because every time--if somebody
is being flattering, you can think to yourself, they are not flattering
me, they don't care what I think. It is this robe, it is this robe, and
you try pretty hard to keep your own personality out of things and
you just do your best to remain connected with the world, to under-
stand that there are men and women and children whom your deci-
sions will affect, to remember who those people are. You think
about it. You try to get out of your office, you try to find other con-
texts. You have your family; you do your best. But I couldn't agree
with you more that it is an incredibly important thing to remem-
ber.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, if you don't want to answer this, it
is OK. It is not that important, but have you ever just taken a
phone call from a citizen since you have been on the bench? Some-
body just calls in that is not related to a case and says, I just want
to talk to the presiding judge.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. Have you?
  Judge BREYER. Well, of course, because--I mean, you started
with the courthouse. I would guess in respect to that courthouse
that somewhere between 50 and 100 meetings of the sort that you
are so familiar with--you go to a citizen's group, you listen.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU went yourself?
  Judge BREYER. Absolutely, and it was so wonderful for me.
  Senator DECONCINI. And you took the criticism that I am sure
there was as with any public building?
  Judge BREYER. Yes; I mean, you worry about
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU didn't wear your robe?
  Judge BREYER. I don't think it would have made a difference to
anyone in any of those groups if I had worn five robes.
  Senator DECONCINI. I am sure that is true.
  Judge BREYER. And that is a good thing. I will tell you day and
night it is a very, very good thing.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge. Judge, let me turn to the
Sentencing Commission. You are indeed an expert. You have been
a very influential voice in the area of criminal law through your
service on the U.S. Sentencing Commission which developed the
Federal sentencing guidelines. These guidelines have been the sub-
ject of some criticism, however. They also have their proponents,
you being one of them.
  In 1989, you wrote in the American Criminal Law Review that
it was too soon after the implementation of the guidelines to evalu-
ate them and determine if they had achieved their goal. You have
repeatedly stated that the goals behind these guidelines were to
                                      182
perpetuate honesty in sentencing and to reduce the unjustifiably
wide disparity in sentencing.

  Now, 5 years have passed since the 1989 article and you can
evaluate the guidelines, I think, far more effectively. In your judg-
ment, have they achieved the two stated goals?

  Judge BREYER. The first, yes; honesty in sentencing is there.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU think it is there?
  Judge BREYER. It is there; that is, the sentence given is the sen-
tence served, and I think that that has helped in the Federal sys-
tem; that is, I think people who understand the differences be-
tween the Federal and the State systems have begun to understand
that the sentence that is given is the sentence that will be served,
with very few--15-percent leeway. That has helped.
  The second has also moved in the right direction, but there are
many, many rocks on that road. It is bumpy, and I think that it
was a very great experiment that the Congress asked to have cre-
ated. I think there is no one who will say it is perfect. There is no
one who will say it has been 100 percent achieved. There is no one
in this whole area of criminal sentencing or the criminal law that
agrees about everything. I mean, there is lots of disagreement, but
I think, in general, if I think about it, it is an experiment that is
still worth running.
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it has been more positive than
negative?
  Judge BREYER. Of course, I was part of it.
  Senator DECONCINI. I understand.
  Judge BREYER. But I do think that, still; I do think that, on bal-
ance, yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. It has improved the system?
  Judge BREYER. On balance, yes, and more to come, more to come.
  Senator DECONCINI. One of the criticisms of the guidelines, as
you know, is that they remove flexibility and require the court to
follow a rigid formula in determining sentencing. I know that you
disagree with this argument and, in fact, I found your holding in
U.S. v. Rivera to be particularly illustrative of the court's ability
to depart from the guidelines when justifiable.
  I assume that Rivera supports the assumption that you believe
that flexibility must be maintained in regard to any sentencing for-
mula or guidelines that are implemented. Is that correct? Is that
what that is all about?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, I am a firm believer that the courts
should be vested with a certain amount of discretion, particularly
in regard to sentencing. Despite your holding in Rivera, one of the
criticisms of the sentencing guidelines is that they give too much
authority to the prosecutor. When you were on that Sentencing
Commission, how did you wrestle with how much authority to give
the prosecutor, and, in your opinion, does the prosecutor have too
much authority under these sentencing guidelines that are in place
today?
  Judge BREYER. This has been an awfully big argument. In my
own personal opinion, the increased authority of the prosecutor has
come primarily because of the existence not of the guidelines, but
of mandatory minimum sentences in statutes because that gives
                                      183
the prosecutor weapons that the prosecutors did not have before.
I think that that is the primary source of the contention. I am not
positive about that because there are people who disagree with
that, but in my personal opinion, that is what it primary is.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS that good for the system, or do you think
that should be continually reviewed?

  Judge BREYER. Well, what I have written on this--and, remem-
ber, you are dealing with a person who spent a lot of times on the
guidelines, and Judge Wilkins, who was the chairman of the Sen-
tencing Commission, and I and most of the other Commissioners
would like to see Congress delegate the authority on sentencing to
the Commission so that the Commission can create guidelines
which judges can depart from in unusual circumstances.

  So it isn't surprising that the Commissioners tend to believe that
they would prefer not to have that rigid, absolute mandatory in the
statute, but that Congress would say to the Commission, please, we
gave you this authority, now carry it out, and we will give you the
flexibility necessary to do it; you have tough sentences, your sen-
tences are usually followed; there is a little bit of flexibility in the
joints through the power to depart and that is the way we would
like you to go. Now, as a former Commissioner, I guess that is the
view I have.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, knowing your criticism of mandatory
minimums, would it be softened at all by inclusion of a so-called
safety valve which would allow a judge to prevent nonviolent first
offenders from serving the full sentence?

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it should be expanded to any-
thing further than nonviolent first offenders from your standpoint?
  Judge BREYER. These are basically decisions for Congress, and
you are taking me out of my role as a judge and you would have
to understand that in anything I do as a judge I follow, and would
follow and intend to follow and have followed the decisions that are
made by Congress in these areas which are embodied in statutes.
  But putting me back in my role as a former Sentencing Commis-
sioner--and what I have written on this is that the sentencing
guidelines are pretty tough, fairly--you know, they are significant
sentences. No one has criticized them for being too lenient.
  Senator DECONCINI. That is correct.
  Judge BREYER. Yet, they do have a bit of flexibility in the joints,
and if you look at that flexibility and you say how often is it used,
it isn't used that often; it is used sometimes. The Sentencing Com-
mission did a study of mandatory minimums and found there was
really more departure, more, whether there should have been or
not, and so all those arguments--the Sentencing Commission has
written it a lot better than I have, so I would say they have reports
on this and I would probably sign on to those reports.
  Senator DECONCINI. A safety valve would be beneficial, in your
judgment, for nonviolent offenders?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Judge Breyer.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I couldn't help but think, listen-
ing to Senator DeConcini's first area of questions on prejudicial

      85-742 - 9 5 - 1
                                      184

statements, I had for years back when I was practicing law a won-
derful New Yorker cartoon which you probably have all seen at one
time or another. Twelve members of the jury are sitting there,
their hair standing straight on end, the judge blithely saying, the
jury will disregard that last remark.

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I would like my full opening
statement regarding the Judge put in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be done.
  [The prepared statement of Senator DeConcini follows:]

                              PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR DECONCINI

  Judge Breyer, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming you before the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. While throughout my Senate career I have always af-
forded great deference to each President's judicial nominations. I was elated when
President Clinton chose to nominate you with your keen intellect and vast experi-
ence with the law.

  I believe that your experience in all three branches of Government provides you
with a unique insight into the respective roles of the administration, Congress and
the judiciary. Your understanding of these separate and distinct functions of our
government--that often overlap and occasionally conflict--provide you with a valu-
able perspective on the separation of powers that are so essential to our system of
democratic government.

  Hopefully, your firsthand knowledge of the workings of Congress, particularly this
committee, has given you an appreciation for the complexities of the legislative proc-
ess. As you know, legislation cannot always be drafted to accommodate every poten-
tial fact pattern or every possible ambiguity. Therefore, the legislative history of a
provision cannot be overlooked. It must be explored to give additional clarity to the
drafters' intent.

  Your Justice Department experience has given you insight into the policy making
role of the executive branch of Government which has hopefully enhanced your un-
derstanding of when deference to an agency decision is deserved and when it is not.

  Your considerable experience as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the First Cir-
cuit has provided you with the opportunity to develop a judicial philosophy that has
served you well in your decisions. You have demonstrated judicial restraint during
your time on the bench that assures this Senator that you are not coming before
us today with a hidden agenda that you intend to bring to the Supreme Court.

  As a result of your well-rounded judicial background and your numerous profes-
sional accomplishments, you come before us today to be confirmed to the highest
court in this Nation. Throughout your life you have repeatedly exhibited the intel-
lect, desire and commitment to excel in each and every endeavor you have under-
taken. It is these characteristics which have brought you here today, and it is these
characteristics which will enhance your role as Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States--a role that will require you to make difficult decisions
that will affect not only the way the Government operates, but more importantly,
will profoundly affect the fundamental rights and liberties of individuals.

  I have followed your career closely over the years. In fact, I had the opportunity
to chair your confirmation hearing before this committee when President Carter ap-
pointed you to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Just as in 1980, these hearings
will explore your judicial philosophy, and as required by the advice and consent
clause of the Constitution, the Senate will determine whether or not you should be
entrusted with this considerable honor and daunting responsibility.

  Judge Breyer, at the end of this Congress I will have had the opportunity to par-
ticipate in the confirmation of eight Supreme Court Justices beginning with the
nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizonan and the first woman on the Su-
preme Court. Just as I was honored to participate in the O'Connor hearing because
of the nominee's unparalleled abilities and dedication to the Constitution, I take
great satisfaction in knowing that your nomination, which may be the last Supreme
Court nomination of my Senate career, also exemplifies exceptional legal scholar-
ship. I believe you will be an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court. I look for-
ward to your views on a wide range of topics, and just as in 1980, I know your re-
sponses will be thoughtful and informative.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, before we let you go, let me ask you, is
there a correlation between delegating to the Commission and the
need to have nonjudges on the Commission?
                                      185

  Judge BREYER. I haven't thought about that, I haven't thought
about that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, at some point, unrelated to this hearing,
when you are confirmed--because I am sure you will still take
phone calls--when you are confirmed, I would like to talk to you
about that because that is an area of some discussion right now.

  Well, Judge, thank you, and I thank your family for your co-
operation this first day. We have a number of patient and very
knowledgeable members of this committee, like Senator Moseley-
Braun, who have been here the whole time and will be, because of
our seniority system, down the line some time tomorrow.

  If we convene at 10 tomorrow and each Senator takes his or her
half hour, which I assume and hope they will, to explore areas of
their concern, that is 4Vfc hours to finish one round. I imagine there
may be additional questions. I will confer with you and with the
ranking member tomorrow, mid-afternoon, to determine whether or
not we attempt to finish up your public testimony tomorrow or go
into the next day.

  As you have observed, there is no desire to rush this. There is
no desire to keep people here late. There is no urgency to get it
done. We are talking about a matter of 24 hours one way or an-
other, finishing this. But if we could finish your testimony, if that
is the will of the committee, and it means you stay another hour
or so, I would like you to begin to think tonight whether you would
rather do that than come back.

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, gentlemen.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, there is a vote tomorrow at
10. We will meet after that vote?
  The CHAIRMAN. There is a vote at 10?
  Senator DECONCINI. I believe so.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was unaware of that.
  Senator DECONCINI. I believe it is a cloture vote.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was under the impression that that might be
vitiated.
  Senator DECONCINI. OK.
  The CHAIRMAN. I will be here by 10:10 to start the hearings if
the vote is at 10. We will vote at the front end and we will begin
then. I understand from Senator Metzenbaum in the discussion I
had with him today that it is another cloture vote. There is a possi-
bility that that vote may not take place, so let us keep it at 10 and
if there is a vote at 10 we will start as shortly after that vote as
we can, no later than 10:15.
  Yes, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, by a previous unanimous consent
agreement, I am going to be managing a bill on the floor starting
tomorrow.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Unfortunately, this was done before we knew
about this. I just would like the Chairman to know that there are
some followup questions, especially on a couple of the answers in
my earlier questions. I will want a second round. I will try to keep
it as short as possible.
                                      186
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes; I am confident that other members will, and
I know you have the Foreign Operations
  Senator LEAHY. Yes, Foreign Operations, so I will not be here
during part of this, but I will come back at an appropriate time to
ask those questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO I am confident we can accommodate everyone,
but we want to accommodate your physical constitution as well,
and I just want you to begin to think about if it is possible--I am
not pressing to do that tomorrow--if it is possible to finish up to-
morrow night. When I said that, your whole family went like this
behind you, except for your wife. She likes seeing you on the hot
seat, I think, here. All kidding aside, we will make that judgment
tomorrow afternoon.
  We will reconvene at 10 unless there is a cloture vote. If that is
the case, it will be as close to 10 as we can make it. Thank you
for your cooperation. We are adjourned until tomorrow at 10.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  [Whereupon, at 6:23 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN G. BREYER TO BE
  AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1994

                                                                     U.S. SENATE,
                                                COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:13 a.m., in room
SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
(chairman of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein,
Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, Brown,
Cohen, and Pressler.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  In the interest of keeping this moving and accommodating the
votes that will take place on the Senate floor, let me very, very
briefly explain how I intend to proceed today. We will proceed with
three Senators in a row asking questions, and then we will take
a break for a few minutes to give the witness a chance to stretch
his legs. I will announce in the next hour for the press, who have
to file, when we will break for lunch. My guess is that we will
break for lunch around 1 o'clock, but we will see how this gets mov-
ing. And I do not intend on going late tonight. I would look to
break, and possibly end Judge Breyer's required presence before
the committee, sometime this evening. I would shoot to end by 6
o'clock unless it looks like we could finish with the witness; in
which case, if it takes another hour or so, we would do that. But
my intention is to break relatively early.
  There are only a few minutes left on this vote which I am about
to make. I thank Senator Specter from Pennsylvania for coming
over to accommodate the committee.
  What I am going to do is a dangerous thing for any Democratic
chairperson to do; that is, yield to the only Republican present to
take over the committee and begin his questioning. But I have ab-
solute, complete trust in the man, so not to worry.
  All kidding aside, I will yield now to Senator Specter for Senator
Specter's round of questioning, and I will be gone for about the 10
minutes it takes me to get over and vote and come back.
  Thank you very much for helping, Senator, and for coming over.
I appreciate it.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S.
            SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It
should be noted that there is not a whole lot I can do in your ab-
sence.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I will not say anything.
  Senator SPECTER. Or in your presence, for that matter. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Senator SPECTER [presiding]. But it is a powerful feeling, Judge
Breyer, to be the entire Senate Judiciary Committee. For those who
may wonder why I am the only one present, it is because a vote
was scheduled at 10 o'clock, and I was there at the start of the vote
to vote early and be able to proceed, because there are a great
many Senators who are waiting to question.
  Judge Breyer, in my opinion, the Senate has no more important
responsibility than the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee
under its advise and consent constitutional duty. The Court, with
its 5-to-4 decisions, has made a practical reality of great power for
that fifth vote, touching the lives of virtually all Americans in
many important cases and sometimes people around the world.
And the nominees, unlike the Presidents who serve for 4 or 8
years, once they are confirmed sit for decades and have a very pro-
found impact on the life of Americans.
  The concern which many of us feel turns on the expanding role
of the Court in taking on decisions of public policy which really
move across the line, I think, very frequently into legislative
rules--really a superlegislature. And that is why I think it is very
important to find out as much about a nominee as we can, and the
experience which I have seen in the 14 years I have been in the
Senate--and this is the ninth confirmation hearing since 1981--the
experience has been the nominees answer about as many questions
as they feel they have to to win confirmation. That is a practical
fact of life on the so-called tension between Senators and nominees.
  I am sorry my colleagues are not here to hear just a little bit of
criticism. We do that to one another occasionally, publicly and pri-
vately. I think it is unfortunate that Senators commit themselves
in advance, because I think that makes confirmation a virtual cer-
tainty, and it has been expressed by many of my colleagues, even
in the course of these hearings and more frequently in the media,
and I think that is unfortunate, because I think that Senators, like
Justices and judges, ought to reserve judgment until they hear all
the witnesses. And there will be some witnesses--there always
are--who will testify in opposition to the nomination.
  I do not want to take too much time on a preliminary statement.
I want to get right down to the issues, and I want to start with
the issue of the relative responsibilities of a judge versus the legis-
lators. And I want to start with the case of Rust v. Sullivan, which
I personally consider to be a matter of judicial legislation.
  When the provisions on Planned Parenthood were passed in
1970, there was a regulation issue which gave the counselors lati-
tude to counsel women on the abortion option. And that was
changed by regulation 17 years later, although Congress had real-
ly, by implication, given its imprimatur of approval to that inter-
pretation. And in a 5-to-4 decision written by Chief Justice
                                      189

Rehnquist, one of his reasons was a "shift in attitude against the
elimination of unborn children by abortion."

  I am at a loss to understand what bearing a shift in attitude has
on the subject, but here we have legislation, a regulation, stands
for 17 years; Congress could have changed it if Congress disagreed
with it. And then along comes the Court and says the new regula-
tion stands; there cannot be any more counseling of women on the
abortion option, in part because of a shift in attitude.

  My question to you, Judge Breyer: Isn't that really a legislative
determination by the Supreme Court?

  TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN G. BREYER, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE
  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
  Judge BREYER. Senator, as you probably know--I do not know if
you know or not, but my circuit had a case that was very, very
similar to that case.
  Senator SPECTER. Same case. Similar case. I know.
  Judge BREYER. And our circuit decided--and I joined the opin-
ion--that came out the other way.
  Senator SPECTER. But your circuit also said that the absence of
congressional action did not determine the case. You had about the
same view. You did not write the opinion.
  Judge BREYER. NO, I did not.
  Senator SPECTER. AS you say, you joined in the opinion. But the
first circuit said that it really was not determinative, that Congress
had let this regulation stand for 17 years.
  Judge BREYER. And we did not go into that in any depth. We did
not go into that in depth and
  Senator SPECTER. Well, you mentioned it. It is there.
  Judge BREYER. That is true. But what you are asking me to do
and why it is difficult is, of course, a judge from a lower court that
decides a case one way is always tempted to think, my goodness,
how right I was. And then the higher court that reverses the lower
court, one is tempted to think that the judges on that court were
wrong.
  Now, in fact, we wrote the case, I joined it, and the Supreme
Court had a different view. On the particular issue you are talking
about, which is a complicated issue, I would have to say that the
way in which the case was argued in our court did not flag that
issue in the way that you have put it. And so I am hesitant to talk
about that only for the reason that it is not something I have
thought through in that context.
  I know the issue in a general context, but I really have not
thought it through in the context of that specific case.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Breyer, there are a couple of cases
which I may come to in a later round where you rendered a judg-
ment outside of the scope of the arguments. And I compliment you
on your background and your capabilities. It does not really have
to be presented head on for you to grasp the import of it.
  The question I have to you is really one of probing your consider-
ation of this in a future issue. Isn't there not only enormous weight
but a virtual conclusion that, if a matter is a longstanding interpre-
tation, Congress has an opportunity to change it, Congress does not
change it--and there are many cases, and I hope to come to some
                                      190
of them later--that that ought to be it? That the Court ought not
to say there is a shift in opinion on the abortion issue and turn the
law around? Isn't that judicial legislation?

  Judge BREYER. It is--I mean, you have raised a complicated and
rather difficult general issue, and I am tempted to say yes, in gen-
eral, but then I have a reservation. The question that you raise in
the most general terms is: Suppose Congress delegates to an agen-
cy, any agency in the Federal Government, suppose it delegates to
the agency the power to have a regulation or the power to interpret
the statute? And what I think about that is, Congress having done
that and the agency having interpreted the statute through a regu-
lation, the Court will later pay a lot of attention to what the agency
says.

  And there are really two different reasons. One reason, which
you are focusing on, is because the Court knows that the agency,
having been involved in the legislative process, probably through
testimony and maybe exchange of staff or being more expert about
it, is likely to know, perhaps better than the Court, what Congress
had in mind. And that kind of reason, the longer that regulation
is in effect, the more exactly what you are saying is true.

  There can be--and this is my reservation--a different kind of
case where Congress quite clearly delegates to the agency the
power both to interpret and to change its mind. Now, if you found
in the statute that that was the situation, of course, the agency
could change its mind because Congress would have said that it
could.

  So I am quite tempted to agree with a lot of what you say, but
I am worried because I have not thought it through in the context
of that particular case.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, would you do this? Because I want to
move on to another line. Think about it, and we will come back to
it.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Because I would be interested in your reflected
views.
  There were a couple of questions asked yesterday on the death
penalty, but I want to pursue that subject in some detail, because
this is an area where the Court is moving, perhaps, to eliminate
the death penalty in America. At the outset, I would disclose my
own position being in favor of the death penalty, having experience
as a district attorney, and I think it is a deterrent. And I am work-
ing to try to preserve it both in the State and in the Federal sys-
tem. And this is an area where I think we see a marked erosion
of legislative authority by what the Supreme Court has done.
  I want to get your views, not as to how you are going to decide
some future case, but to see your thinking on this subject, both as
it illustrates your approach as a prospective Supreme Court Justice
and also as it would give us some insights into your views on the
death penalty.
  This really illustrates the standards which the Supreme Court
has said and articulated which moves really not close to but I think
beyond the legislative line.
  Justice Marshall, in his dissent in Furman, outlines some of the
standards for evolving Supreme Court conclusions, and he says
                                      191

this, articulating the law as he see it. And it is just not a dissent-
ing opinion. There is a lot of background in the Court decisions for
what Justice Marshall has said, and I refer to him with the great-
est respect.

  In Furman, he says:

  The cruel and unusual language must draw its meaning from the evolving stand-
ards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. Thus, a penalty that
was permissible at one time in our Nation's history is not necessarily permissible
today.

  And then in another point in his opinion, he says:

  Time works changes and brings into existence new conditions and purposes. In
the application of the Constitution, our contemplation cannot be only of what has
been, but of what may be.

  Now, you can see from this kind of language that there is a de-
marcation away from the text and the precedents and an evolving
consideration of public policy which goes really very, very close to
what a legislature does, if not really into the legislative area.

  Justice Brennan, also in Furman, comes to the conclusion that
the death penalty is not a deterrent. And he also comes to the con-
clusion that the death penalty, "Its rejection by contemporary soci-
ety is virtually total." That is his conclusion in coming to the judg-
ment that the death penalty is barred in all cases--all cases--by
the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual pun-
ishment.

  Justice Marshall goes back and says that, "Cruel and capital
punishment is morally unacceptable to the people of the U.S."

  Now, the comments by Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan
that, as Justice Brennan puts it, "Its rejection by contemporary so-
ciety is virtually total," and Justice Marshal, "The death penalty is
morally unacceptable to the people of the U.S.," flies in the face of
not only public opinion polls but that fact that 37 States reenacted
the death penalty after it was struck down in Furman and that
more than 70 Senators consistently vote for the death penalty in
the U.S. Senate and about the same on the House.

  Then Justice Marshall, dissenting in Gregg v. Georgia, says, re-
ferring to an observation from his in Furman, that, "The American
people are largely unaware of the information critical to a judg-
ment on the morality of the death penalty," and concluded that if
they were better informed, they would consider it shocking, unjust,
and unacceptable.

  Beyond Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan, Justice Blackmun
made an opinion, rendered an opinion, saying that, "I feel morally
and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death pen-
alty experiment has failed." And he said in a dissent on a cert case,
in Callins v. Collins, that he would no longer uphold the death pen-
alty. And Justice Powell has recently been quoted as saying that
he would be against the death penalty were he still sitting there.

  Now, my question to you is: Given what you have already testi-
fied that there ought not to be a subjective determination by a Jus-
tice, what standing does--take the elements of its being morally
unacceptable to the American people. How proper is that as a basis
which Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan articulate in the face
of the reenactment of the death penalty and in the face of the con-
gressional votes 70-percent-plus strong in reenacting it?
                                      192
  Judge BREYER. I want to reveal to you my thinking without actu-
ally predicting or expressing a view on a particular case that might
come up. And that, as you have said very well, is a question of
drawing the line. And you will correct me, I hope, if you feel I am
not drawing it properly. I want to reveal to you as much as I can
without making that--without crossing the line to decide a particu-
lar case. For reasons of fairness later on and making people under-
stand, I will
  Senator SPECTER. I respect that, Judge Breyer. I know you can-
not comment on how you will decide a pending case. But what this
question looks to is: Is it appropriate given the text of the Bill of
Rights, which refers to the death penalty, and the longstanding use
to rule out the death penalty in all cases on the judgments of indi-
vidual Justices that it is not a deterrent and that the American
people have rejected it? Which I think is factually not so.
  Judge BREYER. First, I think it is fair that I certainly agree--and
I think the vast majority of people would agree--that judges should
not legislate. That is your job. It is not the job of a judge.
  Second, looking at the death penalty, I have said--and I think
this is the case--that it is settled law that applying the death pen-
alty in some circumstances does not violate the cruel and unusual
punishment clause.
  Third
  Senator SPECTER. May I just interrupt you for one quick point?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Do I understand you to say that in some cir-
cumstances you think the death penalty can be constitutionally im-
posed?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I think that is settled law.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that you would reject the Marshall and
Brennan view that it is, on its face, violative of the eighth amend-
ment?
  Judge BREYER. What I have said: in my opinion that is settled
law.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  Judge BREYER. That settled law is surrounded by what I think
of as a cluster of less firmly settled matters, such as how old the
person has to be, though there is case law on it; such as the proce-
dures; such as the types of crimes, the exact details. And in those
areas of detail, it seems to me that I cannot properly go because
it seems to me those are coming up again and again.
  The question, the deep question that you raise, the deep question
that you raise is the question, you would say or as I hear you say-
ing, Fine, everyone is against judges legislating. How do you,
Judge, know whether what you are doing is improperly legislating,
improperly putting in your own subjective views, or quite properly
trying to interpret the law in an area where the question is broad,
open, and important?
  That is difficult. And in my own mind, I cannot say the text is
what answers the question, because in these difficult questions
often it does not, though it certainly is a starting place.
  I cannot say that precedent always answers the question, but it
is terribly important to refer to the precedent, and the opinion
grows out of prior precedent. That is normal.
                                      193

  The history is important as well, both because it reflects an in-
tent of the framers and because it shows how, over the course of
200 years, that intent has been interpreted by others.

  The present and the past traditions of our people are important
because they can show how past language reflecting past values,
which values are permanent, apply in present circumstances. And
some idea of what an opinion either way will mean for the lives of
the people whose lives must reflect those values, both in the past,
in the present, and in the future, is important. And that is what
judges like Harlan, the second Harlan, Frankfurter, who were not
viewed as legislators, would put within the phrase like "concept of
ordered liberty" or "those values that the traditions of our people
review as fundamental."

  Now, you
  Senator SPECTER. Well, there is always--I want to ask you one
related question and then move to another subject, because there
is not a great deal of time. That is a line which is hard to draw.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, it is.
  Senator SPECTER. One of the current major concerns in Congress
and the conference committee on the crime bill is the issue of
whether there will be the application of a quota system on the
death penalty, where my own view expressed on the floor of the
Senate is that the essence of American jurisprudence is individual
justice. What is the nature of the offense, and what is the nature
of the offender?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. AS opposed to having the death penalty invali-
dated on a statistical analysis as to how many other like people of
a given group have been subjected to the death penalty.
  Now, the Supreme Court decided this matter, as you know, 5 to
4 in the McCleskey v. Kemp, and now it is back in Congress. And
the Senate rejected in substantial numbers, and the House passed
it narrowly, and it is now on the front burner of legislation. And
it seems to me that this is a matter which is properly the deter-
mination of public policy, belongs in the Congress, and we ought
to decide it.
  Do you have a settled view on that question? Is McCleskey deter-
minative of that issue?
  Judge BREYER. I think that matters of policy--and this sounds
like a matter of policy for Congress. This came up yesterday, and
I think no judge, I do not think at all, would say statistics are
never relevant. But you have to be careful with statistics and you
have to be careful because they have to really show what they are
supposed to show. And it is so easy for them to show, appear to
show what they do not show.
  Senator SPECTER. But that is a question of reliability of statis-
tics. This is a different issue. This is an issue of whether statistics
are relevant on what happens to others in a given group contrasted
to a determination of the nature of the offense and the nature of
the offender.
  I know this was mentioned briefly yesterday, but I just wanted
to understand your position that you consider the matter resolved
as a constitutional issue by the McCleskey v. Kemp decision and,
                                      194
appropriately, in the legislative range where we are now wrestling
with it in the crime conference committee.

  Judge BREYER. McCleskey is precedent for the particular--you
know, the kind of statistics that were presented there are not mak-
ing the case, and that was decided and that is a precedent.

  Senator SPECTER. It can always be revisited.
  Judge BREYER. Well, yes, but you have to be careful revisiting
precedents. Your question is
  Senator SPECTER. Oh, my next question?
  Judge BREYER. NO, I was not thinking that. I was thinking that
there are--what you are concerned about, there are a couple of
checks, I think, on this subjective view of the judge.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Breyer, in the few minutes I have re-
maining, I would like to pick up a question which has received a
lot of attention, and that is your ruling on the case of U.S. v. Ottati
and Goss. It raises the issue where you had been so careful, as I
understand the facts--and I would like you to confirm them--that
you had not handled any cases involving Lloyd's of London and you
had not been involved in any cases involving asbestos liability; but
that the case of U.S. v. Ottati and Goss did potentially touch one
of the syndicates, Merritt 418, which involved the underwriting of
toxic waste cleanup.
  I would like your comment on the underlying facts and your ob-
servation. And I have no question at all about your integrity, but
I think it is a matter that has to be put on the public record. Also,
we need to learn from it as to what judges who have investments
can do to find out more about what their investments reach to on
matters which come before them.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; I, of course, disclosed all my investments, in-
cluding my investment in Lloyd's. And I have three screening sys-
tems, now four, to make certain that I never sit on a case in which
any firm in which I have an investment, including Lloyd's, includ-
ing that syndicate, including any part of Lloyd's, is a party in that
case.
  The clerk checks everything, all the names that he can find on
those briefs, against the names on my disclosure form.
  My secretary has the same list and sees if anything slips through
that sieve.
  I have the list, and I have been putting it up in my clerk's office,
too, my personal clerks.
  In that case, and in no other case that I am aware of, did any-
thing slip through that sieve. So, to my knowledge, Lloyd's did not
have any direct interest in Ottati and Goss.
  A different issue, I think, was raised about Ottati and Goss, and
the seven or eight pollution cases that I sat on. The different issue
is that sometimes, of course, if you have an investment in company
A, even though company A has nothing to do with this case, maybe
the holding in the case, even though it is quite a different case,
could affect your investment in company A. And there the standard
is: Is it a real effect, a direct effect. "A substantial effect" is the
word of the statute. And the reason that those words are used is
that if you are in--if you have many different stocks, virtually any
case could have some theoretical connection to something.
                                      195

  So what I do is bells go off in my mind if I am sitting on a case
and I begin to think that the holding in that case, even though no
investment is a party, but the holding in that case could affect my
own pocketbook, no such holding went off--no such bell went off in
my mind in respect to Ottati and Goss, nor any of the other seven
pollution cases that I sat on. That is to say, the label is the same.
There is a label called pollution case, and it is true that Lloyd's and
these syndicates and any insurance company can be involved in
any insurance anywhere, and there always can be similarity of
label. But I saw no direct, proximate connection, let alone a sub-
stantial connection, between the holding in that case and my own
pocketbook. And that, I think, in recent days has been confirmed
by lots of people who have read those cases with care, who are ex-
perts in the area, and who have looked to see if my initial judg-
ment--and I cannot tell you my initial judgment is always correct.
I can tell you it is something that I am very, very sensitive to and
that I will remain sensitive to.

  And my reasons are personal because what I really have, after
my own family, is my integrity. And my reasons are institutional,
because it is terribly important that the public understand and re-
spect the integrity of the judicial system. And, therefore, the way
I proceed is full disclosure, three to four screening systems, and
then what I hope is extreme sensitivity to the possibility that a
holding in one case could somehow, through some set of inter-
connections, really affect my pocketbook. And there I will say I
made that judgment call. I thought it would not directly affect my
pocketbook in any direct, proximate, substantial way.

  And I will say that others in the last few days, ethics experts,
various kinds of experts looking at this, agree--though I must add
that reasonable people could disagree, and there are some who do.
And I respect that, and I think it is important to raise such a ques-
tion. And it is important, though I do not want to be repetitive, it
is important for the very reason you raise it. It is very important
that people understand the integrity of the judicial system.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Breyer, I accept your conclusion, and I
fully appreciate the importance of integrity to you personally and
institutionally for the Court. The last question I have on it is the
factual matter, and I understand that there was no reason to see
the connection. But was there a hidden problem that, in fact, the
investments in Merritt 418, which did have liability underwriting
in toxic waste cleanup which touched Superfund could factually
have been involved in your ruling in Ottati and Goss, even though,
as I agree with your statement, you had no reason to know it at
the time?

  Judge BREYER. YOU mean that they had somehow insured that
very toxic waste dump?

  Senator SPECTER. Well, or the precedent from your decision in
Superfund would have had an impact on the liability of a company
in which you had an investment. Factually, did it get there, even
though you had no reason to know about it?

  Judge BREYER. AS to the first part, were they factually involved
in that very toxic waste dump, I believe the answer is no. As of this
moment, I have no reason to think that answer is any different. As
to the second question--that is, could my holding in that case have
                                      196

had a direct impact on my pocketbook, that is, that syndicate?--
I believe the answer is no, though that is judgmental. And what
that means is you have to look at the particular case. And I did
look at that case, and I have thought about it, and I have looked
at it really again and again in the last few days, believe me. And
I still think that there is no direct, proximate money in my pocket
through 418 because of what was or might have been held in that
case.

  That is my belief. That is judgmental. I think many, many others
who have looked at it agree with me. And I recognize that reason-
able people could differ on the point.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Specter.
  Senator Heflin.

     OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWELL HEFLIN, A U.S.
                SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Breyer, we are delighted to see you back
with the Judiciary Committee. It was a pleasure to serve with you
when you were the staff director and the chief counsel. From that
association, which involved many thorny issues, we developed cer-
tain evaluations relative to your personality, your intellect, and
your integrity. And I think they were the highest.

  We had many nonharmonious issues that were raised during
that time, and you were a great consensus builder. However, you
failed in regards to a consensus builder when it came to the codi-
fication of the Criminal Code. I think that is such a thorny issue
which was tried twice to try to do it. You and Ken Feinberg and
others worked on that to get a consensus of that. But from our as-
sociation, we developed a friendship. We developed the highest re-
gard for your integrity, the highest regard for your abilities, and
for your ability to inform everyone.

  We were pleased when we learned that you and a great other
lawyer who was representing the other side, Emory Sneeden,
would meet for breakfast every morning, and you all would do
these things.

  But sometimes, you know, as we think about these friendships
and things, we do not want to let that prevent us from asking some
hard questions. And I think we have that function here.

  To follow up on Senator Specter about Lloyd's, you have men-
tioned your mechanical approach, your technical approach to trying
to determine whether or not there could be an interest of Lloyd's
of London in any case that you had. When did you start that proce-
dure by which you had three check mechanisms that you would fol-
low relative to that when you went on the bench?

  Judge BREYER. That is when I started, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. When you started. All right.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; I cannot tell you every year, but, I mean, I
would say very close to when I started, probably when I started.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, when you practiced law, I supposed you
tried cases in which there were insurance companies involved but
not named. That happens frequently. And the jury is qualified ei-
ther by the attorneys or the judge relative to whether or not there
might be a member of the jury venire who has an interest in or
                                      197

is a shareholder in a certain insurance company, and that appears
in the record.

  Did you in part of your mechanism endeavor to try to look at
transcripts to determine whether or not Lloyd's of London might
have some interest in any case?

  Judge BREYER. I would look through the briefs. That is, if I
came--I read the briefs in every case, and if, in fact, it appeared
from the brief, if, in fact, it appeared in the record, or if, in fact,
I learned it from a brief, then I take myself out of the case. And
that was basically--and that would be true of any investment. You
know, it was not special with Lloyd's. It is that if you learn as a
judge that a firm in which you have an investment has a direct in-
terest in the case, you take yourself out. It is simple. Everyone un-
derstands that. Everyone understands that, and the only risk in
such a thing is that something slips through the net. And you try
to cast the net what I would call reasonably wide.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, now, under the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure, in many instances you do not have the full transcript.
You have designated portions of it, what you could do. But I think
it is wise to sort of look back relative to the transcript and the jury
venire questioning to determine whether or not there could be.
That is something you might consider adding. I think your mecha-
nisms that you have listed are good, but that is a method by which
generally it will show up, because lawyers are very diligent and
want juries asked the question: Do you have stock? That is the only
way some lawyers get into the jury's mind that there is insurance
in a case relative to that.

  Now, I have read various letters that have been presented to us,
and one is from Geoffrey Hazard, who was the Sterling Professor
of Law at Yale and then I believe is now at the University of Penn-
sylvania, and who I have a great regard for and is probably one
of the leading authorities on judicial ethics and legal ethics. He
was the chief draftsman of the Code of Judicial Ethics when it was
drafted in 1972, and I happened to be on the court at the time and
worked with him. My State was one of the first to adopt the Amer-
ican Bar Association models of judicial ethics.

  I have read his letter, and I think his letter goes to the point and
is excellent, and I want to just point out that he says that, "I am
advised that Judge Breyer as judge participated in a number of
cases" involving CERCLA, which is Superfund.

   None of these cases involved Lloyd's as a party or by name in any respect. None
appear to have involved issues that would have material or predictable impact on
general legal obligations under the Superfund legislation.

  And then he says:

   In my opinion, Judge Breyer's participation in the foregoing cases did not entail
a violation of judicial ethics. None of the cases involved Lloyd's as a party or as hav-
ing an interest disclosed in the litigation. None could have had a material effect on
Judge Breyer's financial interests. None had a connection direct enough with Judge
Breyer as to create a basis on which his impartiality might reasonably be ques-
tioned * * *

  Then he goes on and says that, "There is a close analogy between
the kind of investment as a Name"--and, of course, "Name" is
meaning that it is under Lloyd's. That is the way a person partici-
pates.
                                      198

  There is a close analogy between the kind of investment as a Name and an invest-
ment in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is an investment that holds the securities
of operating business enterprises. Ownership in a mutual fund is specifically ex-
cluded as a basis for imputed bias under [the code] and the Code of Judicial Ethics.
This exclusion was provided deliberately, in order to permit judges to have invest-
ments that could avoid the inflation risk inherent in owning Government bonds and
other fixed income securities but without entailing direct ownership in business en-
terprises.

  Now, Chief Justice Roger Traynor of the Supreme Court of Cali-
fornia, who worked on the Code of Judicial Ethics, went on to say
that the idea of a common fund or a similarity to a mutual fund
is because of the impossibility of keeping track of the portfolio of
such a fund. But if a mutual fund had only insurance companies,
that might raise a flag of caution.

  Now, when you consider Lloyd's, Lloyd's is known nationwide as
insuring anything. They say, all right, if you want--insurance com-
panies will not insure this, but you can get it under Lloyd's of Lon-
don. So the idea of having an investment in Lloyd's of London
raises some sort of an issue pertaining to this as to whether or not,
after going on the bench, you ought to divest yourself of any inter-
est in Lloyd's.

  Now, what is your feeling relative to that? Did that enter your
mind, the fact that Lloyd's of London is such a widely known and
the fact that you--of course, you filed disclosures all during the
time that you were there, so it was publicly known. But there is
that issue of whether or not that raises a red flag.

  Judge BREYER. AS I understood it, it was like a mutual fund. I
would go over and visit my mother-in-law and family over there,
Joanna's family, in the summer. And what it consisted of, my in-
vestment, is you would go and spend an hour's lunch with this per-
son who was the agent, who would tell you we have various--we
are proceeding for the next year, and anything in the world can be
insured. And when you read about losses, remember, losses in some
areas have gains in another. You will never know. You will never
know how the insurance all works out. You will never know what
is insured. You will never know whether there is a gain or a loss.
What can be a gain for one company can be a loss for another. If
there are a lot of losses, that can be good because then more people
want to buy insurance. So in a sense, it was a good investment like
a mutual fund because it is all over the place and there is no way
to predict whether any case would help you or hurt you if you tried.

  On the other hand, that word "insurance," as I have learned in
the last few weeks, that word "insurance" does ring bells. And basi-
cally what I decided--it takes a long time to get out of Lloyd's. You
have to resign, and then it takes 3 years. So when I first became
a judge, I put it down. I knew it would take 3 years, and I did not
immediately resign. By 1988, I had reached a conclusion such as
you suggest, and I resigned. That is partly why I did. That is partly
what I wrote.

  I think the thing to do now is--given the issue that has come up,
I am not interested in having an investment in an insurance com-
pany. It does not affect--I mean, that is why I said yesterday I
would like to simply get rid of it.
                                      199

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, now, there are other experts in the field
of judicial ethics and legal ethics. Professor Stephen A. Gillers at
New York University Law School comes out and says:

  I see no evidence that the decisions in Judge Breyer's case would have had a di-
rect or substantial effect on his interest as a syndicate that has insured against risk
of liability for environmental pollution.

  He supports you.
  John Frank, who worked on these issues when they were being
formulated and worked as a consultant, and others, have written
letters, and I think they ought to be introduced into the record, all
of these--I believe they were addressed to Mr. Lloyd Cutler--per-
taining to these matters; I think they ought to be in the record.
  But Professor Hazard does say this:

  In my view, it was possibly imprudent for a person who is a judge to have such
an investment because of the potential of possible conflict of interest and because
of the possible appearance of impropriety.

  Now, what do you say to that statement by Professor Hazard?
  Judge BREYER. I would say at the time that I entered into this
investment in the 1970's, and my keeping it through the mid-
1980's, I thought basically it is like being in the Dreyfus Fund, or
it is like being in a big stock fund, although it is a fund of insur-
ance risks. And I did not think beyond that. So it seemed the diver-
sity was OK and probably a good thing for a judge, because you
have a tiny little bit of risk everywhere, and therefore it is not
going to affect you directly in any way, unless they are involved in
the case.
  Having listened to what you have said, and having become ac-
quainted with Professor Hazard's view, I accept that view, and I
think if there are a substantial number of people who believe it is
imprudent, that that is an added reason why I should be out of this
investment, and I will be out of it as absolutely soon as I possibly
can. That is what I will do.
  Senator HEFLIN. Let me go to another subject that have briefly
been asked about you, and that is sentencing guidelines; and they
are controversial. I have to admit that I was not that enthusiastic
about them; I thought there were other ways of handling disparity
of sentences other than the sentencing guidelines. I think Senator
Mac Mathias and I were the only ones who raised questions about
this. I think that some of the States have come up with better sys-
tems, rather than the system that we adopted at the Federal level.
  But there are a lot of them today--here is a statement that Pro-
fessor Albert Alschuler of the University of Chicago Law School
points out: "You scratch the guidelines anywhere, and you get a
horror story. Judge Stephen Breyer is as responsible for the mess
as anybody else." Now, of course, he is looking at it from his view-
point that they are all a mess. There are others who feel like the
guidelines are working, but the question of the mandatory mini-
mum sentences--in a recent article that you wrote, you made this
statement:

  All right. Let us not call them mandatory statutory sentences. We can call them
bananas, and we will say we have got to get rid of these bananas because they are
very rotten bananas, and they tend to infect the criminal justice system. I think,
frankly, it is a kind of mess, and from the point of view of people who are interested
                                                  200

in an effective system and also a rule of law that people will be able to enforce, it
seems fairly obvious to me that we ought to get rid of them.

  Now, I do not think this is going to be necessarily a judicial ques-
tion. Do you have any advice that you would give Congress pertain-
ing to this issue as Congress proceeds and as it is proceeding today
on the crime bill, in which there are more and more mandatory
minimum sentences, that are being formulated in the crime bill?

  Judge BREYER. Senator, the rather colorful statement that you
read was not made in a judicial context. The view that I was ex-
pressing and said yesterday that I thought perhaps it would be un-
derstandable that I would have this view because after all, Judge
Wilkins and I and others on the Commission were sentencing com-
missioners, and we naturally thought that it was an advisable
thing for Congress to give to the Sentencing Commission the power
to write guidelines which are fairly tough guidelines, but which
have a little oil in the joints for unusual cases, where, if there is
an unusual case, the judge can depart, though the Court of Appeals
will review that for reasonableness.

  Now, being a commissioner--a former commissioner--it is not
surprising that I would hope that Congress would continue to dele-
gate authority to that Commission, see how they exercise it, and
if you feel they are exercising it badly, then change that authority.
But that seemed to me to be consistent with your general hope to
remove some of this from the political arena and to try to make it
consistent and coherent.

  So for that reason, I have expressed the view, sometimes color-
fully, sometimes not, that to have a somewhat random or different
assortment of mandatory minimum sentences is not consistent with
that and would not work well. That was the view that I expressed,
and it is not surprising that I have that view. I think it does not
work well from the point of view of criminal law enforcement. That
was the view that I have publicly expressed; that is true.

  It is a legislative question, and however it is decided in Congress,
the courts will enforce the determination that Congress makes.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I am not asking you to judge on this; I am
asking your view relative to giving advice to Congress. You are still
of the opinion that there ought to be a very few mandatory sen-
tences; I assume that is your position?

  Judge BREYER. That was the view of the Sentencing Commission.
They prepared a study, and what the studied showed was when
they write guidelines, the departure rate is low; it is about 7 per-
cent, 8 percent downward and a couple of percent upward.

  Senator HEFLIN. Let me ask you another tough question. Sup-
posedly--this has been brought out by David Garrow's book, "Law
and Sexuality," and he suggests that you wrote the first draft of
Justice Goldberg's concurrence in Griswold v. Connecticut. Will you
give us information pertaining to your participation in that opin-
ion?

  Judge BREYER. If you had worked for Justice Goldberg as I did,
you would be fully aware that Justice Goldberg's drafts are Justice
Goldberg's drafts. It was Justice Goldberg who absolutely had the
thought, that his clerks implemented, and both my coclerk Stephen
Goldstein and I did--there were two at that time--and we worked
                                      201
on that draft. I might have worked on it a little more than he. But
it is Justice Goldberg's draft.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, as a clerk, you generally follow the direc-
tions of your judge

  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  Senator HEFLIN [continuing]. Or you cease to be a clerk.
  Judge BREYER. That is correct, that is correct.
  Senator HEFLIN. Much has been said about your ability to be a
consensus builder, and the collegiality of the Court. Do you think
that the collegial atmosphere of the John Marshall Supreme Court
is preferable to the more--or at least it appearing--to the appear-
ing contentious atmosphere of the Court today; and what do you
think are the advantages of collegiality and consensus, and what
role do you think you can play to help bring this about?
  Judge BREYER. That is a very big question. John Marshall's Su-
preme Court played a major role in building the United States of
America. It made real the constitutional promise that there would
be one Nation. It did that through the decisions that we all know.
  I think the consensus was critical there to the fact that we have
a United States with limited government, with great freedom, that
allows us to live together. It is a remarkable thing, that Court. No
court could live up to that Court--maybe the Brown Court--but
really tough to do.
  Consensus is important. Consensus is important for a number of
reasons. One is the effort to obtain consensus tends to downplay
the individual ego of the individual judge, and that makes it more
likely that there will not be subjectivity, and there will not be per-
sonal views, and everyone will put his mind or her mind to the
more important task of determining the law.
  Consensus is important because law is not theoretical; law is a
set of opinions and rules that lawyers have to understand; judges
have to understand them; lower court judges have to understand
them. And eventually, the labor union, the business, small busi-
ness, everyone else in the country has to understand how they are
supposed to act or not act according to law. And consensus helps
produce the simplicity that will enable the law to be effective.
  Now, how do you achieve that consensus? That is hard. It is not
a question of bargaining--I will give you that, or I will give you
that--believe me, it is not that kind of a question. It is a question
of trying to listen to other people. It is a question on our Court of
each judge listening to the other. And I bet you found that on yours
as well. And you think it is so much more important to another
person. You listen to the argument, and even if you say, "In the
opinion, it might be argued that, but we reject that," the other
judge is much happier. The point of view is taken into account, and
that tends to draw people together. And then, when the different
judges understand that their own ego is less at stake, you do not
stick on every little minor thing; try, and try to get a view in the
opinion that is straight, that is clear, that pays attention to the dif-
ferent arguments and that treats them fairly, then I think consen-
sus comes along. It is pretty general, but I think it is important.
  Senator HEFLIN. Charles Evans Hughes once wrote that dissents
are vital to a living Constitution because they appeal "to the brood-
ing spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a
                                                202

later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissent-
ing judge believes the Court to have been betrayed." You, however,
have commented favorably on the fact that your circuit produces
very few dissenting opinions. Don't we make bad decisions worse
by discouraging dissenting opinions? Should Justice Harlan have
been encouraged not to write his now famous dissent in Plessy v.
Ferguson?

  So now I am asking you--a consensus builder, when and in what
circumstances do you feel that dissents ought to come from the
members of the Court?

  Judge BREYER. In my own court, and I am sure in yours, Sen-
ator, there is no problem--there was no problem--if people felt
strongly, they dissented. The thing that you would like to have the
judges feel, and that is why I feel we were quite lucky in the first
circuit, is look, this is not a matter of your own ego, this is not a
matter of being picky that it does not say exactly what you want
on minor things. Use common sense about this. Remember that you
are writing for lawyers and judges and others who are going to
have to apply this opinion and live under it. Remember all that.
Now, if you think that this majority opinion is wrong on a signifi-
cant point, you file a dissent. That happens. That happens in our
court. It is the right thing.

  Senator HEFLIN. Before joining the Supreme Court, Justice Gins-
burg said that she felt the Supreme Court judges wrote too many
memorandums and held too few discussions. Do you agree with her
assessment, and in encouraging consensus in the first circuit, did
you find it easier to encourage consensus by speaking as opposed
to writing to each other?

  Judge BREYER. That is interesting. I agree with her about quite
a lot, but not on that. It actually helps to put it in memoranda. It
is interesting, you know, in our court, Judge Torruella is in San
Juan, Puerto Rico; Judge Cyr is in Maine; Judge Bownes and
Judge Stahl now are up in New Hampshire; Judge Campbell and
I and now Judge Boudin were in Massachusetts; Judge Selya is
down in Rhode Island. That is where we are most of the time, and
we most of the time communicate through memoranda; and actu-
ally, the memoranda help, because you start talking about a com-
plicated case in a discussion, and then people get--"I cannot re-
member exactly; was it this point, or was it that point, and what
did I actually think about it?"--and before you know it, the discus-
sion gets a little confused. But if you get into the habit of do not
worry about your English, do not worry about it being perfectly
phrased--if you have an idea, put it on a piece of paper, sit there,
write it out, send it around. And you get into the habit of reading
each other's views and realizing nobody is wedded, but this is what
he is thinking at the moment, and we will change that. That actu-
ally helps. So I am more on the side of written, actually, than oral;
I have learned that.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, does that give you more of a wedding,
though, sometimes, rather than discussing it?

  Judge BREYER. NO; you can discuss it
  Senator HEFLIN. There are a lot of Justices with a prima donna
approach, and there are a lot of prima donnas on the bench who
                                              203

have an idea that they have a pride of authorship and a pride of
language that is difficult to make them change.

  Judge BREYER. Oh, yes, but you have to get the habit that this
is really tentative. You know, another interesting thing is people
get into the habit, they have an idea, and the other person incor-
porates it into the opinion; so you have helped the other person
write the opinion. Interesting. That can

  Senator HEFLIN. I see my time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that spoken as a former chief justice or as a
Senator?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, maybe more as a former justice; I would
say that they are not wedded as much around here because it is
generally written by staff. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HANK BROWN, A U.S. SENATOR
                       FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, we all admire not only your outstanding record,
but your perseverance in surviving this deliberation. We trust that
you will be kinder to the people who appear before you at Court
than we are to you.
  I have been particularly intrigued with the opportunity to read
some of your writings--I have not read all of them, but I have read
some--and to listen to your responses. You strike me as an individ-
ual who is not only a legal scholar but as someone who combines
it with a scientific approach to examining facts. I sense in you a
willingness to go beyond a doctrinaire political philosophy and look
at facts in making up your mind. Is that a fair judgment?
  Judge BREYER. Goodness, I hope so. I am a little biased, but I
hope so. Thank you.
  Senator COHEN. I think the judge indicated he does not like flat-
tery.
  Senator BROWN. Well, I think we can take care of that, too. But
I find it intriguing and refreshing that someone would have that
orientation. That scientific, nonideological approach to judging is
much needed in our judicial system.
  You spoke earlier today about the courthouse in Boston. Senator
DeConcini addressed the expenditures and walked through some of
the factors with you. There were several items that were not cov-
ered, and I just wanted to clear those up.
  First, it would be helpful if you would outline the responsibilities
you, as the chief judge of the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
had with regard to that courthouse. What was your responsibility?
What did you control and not control?
  Judge BREYER. We came in--I say "we," because Judge Woodlock
of the district court and I were basically the judges' representa-
tives--and we worked with primarily the people in the General
Services Administration. And where we entered in the process, the
demand for the courthouse--the need for it had been there for
many years before I became chief judge, and eventually, through
a normal governmental administrative process, the demand led to
a GSA study, which led to show the need for the court, which led
to funding, all of which goes according to rules, and I think all of
                                               204

the funding was provided according to rules. The amount of the
funding is set according to rules, and all that I think was applied
right across the board in normal way.

  Where we really entered was that what Judge Woodlock wanted
to do and what I wanted to do was to use with this what I think
a perfectly straightforward appropriation for a courthouse that has
a straightforward need; could that money be spent in a way that
would be of benefit to more than judges and more than litigants
and more than lawyers. We had a very attractive site. We spent
a long time trying to choose the right architect. We narrowed it to
seven. Certainly, I think those seven, most of them would be on
anyone's list of the best architects in the United States. Eventually,
we chose an architect, Harry Cobb, and I will tell you what he did
to us that is so interesting to me.

  He showed us a picture of a courthouse in Virginia, a courthouse
that was built I think in the 17th or early 18th century. And what
you saw in that courthouse was not expense. It was made of inex-
pensive material. It had one room, and it had a portico in front.
And in that portico, you could see it was the center of the town.
Not just lawyers and not just judges, but everyone in that town
would gather there, because that building, as so many courthouses
in the 18th century and in the 19th century in this country, in the
North, the South, the East and the West, they were symbols, and
they were used as symbols; they were used in reality as centers of
places. Government is part of the community in many ways,
and

  Senator BROWN. My question was really more focused on wheth-
er you, as chief judge, were the one who made the decision on
which architect was hired? Were you the one who made decisions
on the plan? What I wanted to pin down was specifically what your
responsibilities were in that process.

  Judge BREYER. We had a committee, and the committee was
GSA, and GSA has the legal authority, and the legal authority was
always with GSA. But GSA was extremely cooperative, and GSA
worked with us and brought the architects in, and we worked to-
gether, and we would meet every, single week, and we worked with
community groups, we worked with all the groups in the city that
had an interest in this. I would call it in practice a cooperative
process; in law, it was a legal process under the control of GSA.

  Senator BROWN. So they looked to you for advice, but for exam-
ple, you were not the one who set the budget for the courthouse?

  Judge BREYER. NO; that is correct.
  Senator BROWN. The newspaper reports indicate a cost of $285
a square foot cost for the building and estimate that it is triple the
average courthouse. Are those two assessments correct as far as
you know--the $285 a square foot figure, and that it is three times
the average of a normal courthouse?
  Judge BREYER. The number--I do not know how they calculated
it--but the number that I usually think, which is a GSA calcula-
tion, was somewhere around $212, $214, somewhere in that range,
and that it was right in the middle of the price of Federal court-
houses; that is, there were quite a few more expensive, and there
were quite a few less expensive. It is right in the middle range.
                                               205

That is my impression. You could check directly with GSA. They
have all the numbers.

  Senator BROWN. The Washington Post and another one of the
Washington papers indicated that the courthouse included a
$450,000 appropriation for a boat dock associated with the court-
house.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Does that mean the judges lost their moor-
ings? [Laughter.]

  Senator BROWN. Well, I think it is probably in the interest of the
Senate not to talk about people who have lost moorings.

  I am wondering first of all if the boat dock was in your rec-
ommendations and if it is something you approved of?

  Judge BREYER. We have no choice. That is to say, it is built on
a piece of land that had a boat dock there already, and I think,
under the rules and regulations of GSA, that that boat dock must
remain suitable for water transport. It was going to be used for
public water transport in the city. The hope, I think, of GSA there
is that this could be used for public water transport of all different
sorts; the Park Service might use it. But the requirement that it
be restored and retained was there under normal rules and regula-
tions. We had no choice about that.

  Senator BROWN. And $789,000 for original art work?
  Judge BREYER. In every public building under the rules and reg-
ulations of GSA, I think under the Senate and congressional law,
one-half of 1 percent, I believe it is, of the construction budget
must be set aside for works of art, and this was done according to
that rule, regulation and law, and I think it helps that.
  Senator BROWN. $1V^ million for a floating marina?
  Judge BREYER. That must be the same as the first.
  Senator BROWN. In combination with the dock.
  Judge BREYER. There is only one dock there. There is only one
dock, and that is a restoration of the dock that was there already.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Let me draw your attention for a moment to an interesting area
of law. With your broad experience, you ought to have some inter-
esting comments for us. We have been fortunate enough to pick up
some of the tenets of common law as we develop our own law. One
of the more interesting common law concepts that Blackstone re-
cited in his works is the idea that the sovereign can do no wrong,
or the king can do no wrong. It has been modified over the years.
The British have found areas where they make exceptions to it.
  The Framers of the Constitution found something in this concept
to model on, and they created areas of congressional immunity. The
Constitution, in the speech and debate clause, seems to grant Con-
gress some immunities. We have also exempted ourselves from a
variety of statutes, whether it is civil rights, or OSHA, or fair labor
standards, and a variety of others.
  Over the years, I have seen disclosure requirements simply ig-
nored when Members of Congress did not comply.
  We have made some progress in the last few years in changing
this. The U.S. Supreme Court said in U.S. v. Lee in 1982 that no
man is so high in this country that he is above the law.
  I want you to reflect for a moment on what you consider to be
the constitutional basis for legislative immunity from the law.
                                               206

  Judge BREYER. The most obvious place is the speech and debate
clause. Let me see if I can find it readily. But the speech and de-
bate clause does basically mean that you, during your speeches and
debates in the floor of the Senate or in the House of Representa-
tives, have an immunity, and that immunity, for hundreds of years,
has been seen in the law not just as a protection of you, but as a
protection of your constituents, those who vote for you, to make
certain you are completely free to say what you want on the floor
of this House. That is protecting them, and I think that you are
protected in order to protect them.

  Senator BROWN. DO you see exemptions other than relating to
speech and debate that would exempt us from criminal prosecution
or civil legal action if the underlying action is not related to speech
and debate and not related to a specific exemption in law?

  Judge BREYER. In the Constitution itself, I cannot--nothing im-
mediately comes to mind. There may be a range that I am missing,
that just is not coming into my mind, but that I

  Senator BROWN. I appreciate that sometimes we are hitting you
cold with these things, and you need time to reflect.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator BROWN. What basis you find in the Constitution for judi-
cial immunity.
  Judge BREYER. There is a judicial immunity. It is well estab-
lished that there is a judicial immunity from suit. Whether that is
a constitutional basis, many of these--what I do not know in an-
swering your question, since that is such a well established thing,
and how interesting you ask me a question, something I know, ba-
sically, that that is well established, and you are saying does it rest
on the Constitution, or does it just rest on this long tradition that
was a common law tradition and then picked up in the Federal sys-
tem--that is a good question, and I do not know the answer to
that. I do not know the answer to that.
  Senator BROWN. Obviously, our practices are somewhat mixed,
because they rest not only on the Constitution and the common
law, but specific statutes as well. In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Court
considered Presidential immunity. The Court decided that the
President has absolute immunity from civil damage liability arising
from his official acts, in the absence of explicit congressional action
indicating the contrary.
  What do you consider the constitutional basis for Presidential im-
munity.
  Judge BREYER. I do not know how article I and article II really
interact with what this long tradition has been. There is a famous
statement by Learned Hand--and now, having referred to it, I am
sure I will get it wrong--but basically, he talks
  Senator BROWN. He is not here to contradict you.
  Judge BREYER [continuing]. That is true--but he talks about this
tradition of immunity and explains it very well how many officials
do have immunity, and the reason--a policeman, for example, in
certain areas, or prosecutors in certain areas, or judges--the reason
is basically to permit a public official to act so that Government
can function without thousands and thousands of lawsuits; then,
what is the nature of the immunity, and under what cir-
cumstances, and is it qualified, and where is it absolute. Those are
                                               207

the subjects of dozens of cases, dozens and dozens--indeed, we
have had an awful lot in our circuit arising--a lot of them have
arisen in Puerto Rico, actually.

  Senator BROWN. DO you see an immunity for the President that
extends beyond his official acts?

  Judge BREYER. That, I do not know.
  Senator BROWN. DO you see a basis in the Constitution for the
President to order a Federal judge to dismiss a private suit filed
against him if that suit is not related to his official acts?
  Judge BREYER. Those are the kinds of questions that have never
come before me. If they ever came, I would read the briefs, consider
the arguments and think about them, and try to get the correct de-
cision.
  Senator BROWN. I can appreciate that as a proper approach and
one we would hope you would take. My question is, Do you know
of a provision of the Constitution that would grant the President
the power to order the dismissal of a suit against the President if
it did not relate to official acts?
  Judge BREYER. There are the cases that I know and the cases
that I do not know. The cases that I do know--as you began, I sud-
denly realized that while I am quite familiar with a lot of law in-
volving immunity, I have never had to face the question, or never
thought through, or it has never arisen, what the constitutional,
common law, or statutory source is for the fundamental immunity.
And then the area I do not know really at all, because it has never
come up, is this question involving the President.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Let me refer you now to the field of property rights. You have
talked with several members of the committee about property
rights. One of the intriguing things in this area has been the phe-
nomenon of the classification of some rights as being property
rights and some rights being personal rights and, in our discussion
of them, separating them into different categories. My own perspec-
tive has been that it is very difficult to separate the two; it is an
artificial distinction. Someone's ability to own property is a per-
sonal right in that someone's person is affected by what happens
to their property. Whether you would agree with me that that is
an artificial distinction or not, I want to direct your thinking to the
different ways we treat specifically enumerated rights and other
rights that are unenumerated, or implied by the Constitution.
  The fifth amendment is an enumerated right that prohibits pri-
vate property from being taken for public use without just com-
pensation; or article I, section 10, "No State shall pass any law im-
pairing the obligation of contracts." Those are rights spelled out
specifically in the Constitution. They tend to relate to property
rights.
  Then there is another set of rights that are implied by the Con-
stitution, under the due process clause for example. We apply dif-
ferent tests to these rights. Specifically enumerated property rights
in substance get a lower test or lower protection than some of the
unenumerated rights which are not even mentioned in the Con-
stitution.
  In the Dolan case, the current Court had an interesting phrase;
I will read it to you:
                                                  208

  We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a
part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment, should
be relegated to the status of poor relation in these comparable circumstances.

  What are your thoughts on the sentiments that quote expresses?
  Judge BREYER. I do not think I see these things in tiers. I think
I see, or at least I start out by seeing--and I might learn more
later--but I start out by seeing the individual words of the Con-
stitution that start talking about rights as trying to identify certain
basic values or clusters of values, and those values are obviously
different, and they lend themselves to different kinds of potential
regulation or State interference, depending on what they are.
  But you, I thought, said which is there is a sense in which a per-
son's own personality can be mixed with a material thing--think
of your old sofa, or mine, or our house; we live in it for a while,
and think of how it becomes part of us. And there is something in
also being able to earn a living that is terribly important to every-
one. And those kinds of things--what the Court said in Roth--it is
the purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect people
in those rights which they rely upon in their ordinary lives. You
see, it is driving at something that is important under that term
"property"--a different thing than under free speech and so forth,
but still something that is important to people. How that interacts
with the needs of the rest of society to function will be different,
because it is a different kind of thing. That is why the Constitution
does not enact some particular theory of the economy. That is why
the Constitution recognizes, and Holmes, again, recognized, you
know, the need, that it is perfectly necessary for the Government
to say to a coal mine operator: Coal mine operator, you must leave
columns of coal in the mine so it does not collapse. That is called
regulation.
  Balancing what is at the heart of the matter in the case of prop-
erty and the need for society to function through regulation is dif-
ferent in that area than in some other area, but that is because dif-
ferent things are involved, and because, quite clearly, as we said
yesterday, no particular theory of the economy is written into the
Constitution.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, would you yield on that point?
  Senator BROWN. I would be glad to yield.
  The CHAIRMAN. We do not balance in the same way whether or
not a black man or woman can move into a neighborhood.
  Judge BREYER. NO; absolutely not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Explain the distinction, please.
  Judge BREYER. There is a basic promise of fairness written right
into the Constitution in the 14th amendment.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO there is a tier--the Senator's point is correct,
though--there is a tier.
  Judge BREYER. Seen that way, there is a tier. Seen that way,
there is a tier. Seeing--you start talking about taking away a
toothbrush--I am saying there can be something basic, but there
is a tier, of course.
  The CHAIRMAN. And you do see that tier?
  Judge BREYER. Yes; I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Thank you.
  I thank you for the interruption.

  Senator BROWN. I wanted to go back to an aspect of this, but you
have intrigued me with your response. As I understand it, you have
talked with leaders of other countries who are in the process of
drafting constitutions. You observed that not only was the Con-
stitution important, but the customs and traits and accepted prac-
tices were perhaps equally as important.
  Do you look to those in helping to determine what the Constitu-
tion means when you interpret it?
  Judge BREYER. The way in which people live and how they live--
yes. The basic values in the Constitution are supposed to apply in
this society.
  Senator BROWN. Perhaps there is no alternative. Perhaps that
has to be part of it. I am wondering how is it that some specifically
enumerated rights have received a lower level of protection than a
number of unenumerated rights have received. How do you justify
it in your own mind if you look at the Constitution?
  Judge BREYER. Well, if you are thinking of--I think the answer
I gave yesterday is an easier way for me to make the point. What
I had said--when you say that, when I see directly what you are
thinking about, it seems to me what you are thinking about is the
protection accorded property as compared, say, to the protection ac-
corded free speech. And I think what people learned over the
course of time was that when the Supreme Court in the early part
of this century began to say these are exactly the same thing, they
ran into a wall. And the wall that they ran into was it will not
work. And the reason that it will not work is that when you start
down that track, you see that what you are reading into that word
"property" is a specific kind of economic theory, the very kind of
theory that Holmes said the Constitution did not enact. And there-
fore the Constitution being a practical document has of necessity
given the Government greater authority to regulate in the area of
property than it has given the Government to regulate in the area
of free speech. That I think is the simplest way to look at it. That
is how I look at it.
  Senator BROWN. And that is a line of reasoning that you are not
uncomfortable with.
  Judge BREYER. NO; I think that is well-established. I think it
would be--I mean, I do not know that everyone accepts it--but it
seems to me a rather traditional--that does not mean there is no
protection for property, as you point out. There are specific parts
of the Constitution that deal with it.
  Senator BROWN. YOU have talked with several Senators about re-
ligious rights. I am intrigued that the effect of our rulings has been
not simply to protect people's right of religious freedom, but seems
in some cases to have gone to the point of protecting people from
religion--that is, restricting an ability to give a prayer at com-
mencement and so on. In effect, we have almost elevated the cause
of an agnostic or an atheist to a status above someone who has a
religious belief.
  How do you view the rights of agnostics or atheists to impact a
public ceremony where a prayer is at issue?
  Judge BREYER. These cases have to rise under the establishment
clause. I will stay away from any specific case. I think it is fairly
well established as case law that the establishment clause means
                                      210

at bottom that the Government of the United States is not to favor
one religion over another, nor religion over nonreligion, so that peo-
ple's area of personal belief is their area. They can practice it them-
selves, and they should, and it is terribly important, and they cer-
tainly can pass it on to their children, and that is terribly impor-
tant.

  But persons who are agnostic, persons who are Jewish, persons
who are Catholic, persons who are Presbyterians, all religions, all
religions and nonreligion, too, is on an equal footing as far as the
Government is concerned. That is the basic principle.

  How you apply that, how you apply that is often complicated, be-
cause everyone believes, everyone believes, I, and I think I am not
alone, that religion itself, a church receives some assistance from
the State. No one is going ^o allow the church to burn down, with-
out sending the fire department. And there is a whole range of as-
sistance that churches can receive, and properly so.

  Then when does that cross the line to become too much, to be-
come a kind of government establishment? That is what the cases
in the Supreme Court try to address.

  Senator BROWN. When the Court rules that you cannot offer a
prayer at graduation, doesn't the Court find itself in a position
where it is choosing between religious beliefs and an atheistic be-
lief?

  Doesn't the Court find itself favoring one over the other, once it
makes decisions in that area?

  Judge BREYER. Well, certainly people have written and talked
about the very kind of problem that you raise. As I see that kind
of problem, it is not a problem of aiding a religious institution.
Really, it is a problem of a secular institution and the extent to
which you can inject religion into that secular institution, at one
point, is it de minimis or really why not, and so forth.

  I think as the Court has approached that, it has approached it
with a recognition that the great religious wars of 300 years ago
were fought over not just the religious principle for an individual,
but also the right of an individual and his family to pass on his
own principles to the next generation, that is over teaching. And
so it is not surprising to me that the rules become stricter and
stricter, the more the education of children is involved. And that
is how I see what has happened in the Court, and I understand
that there are difficult line-drawing problems.

  Senator BROWN. Let me follow up just briefly on that. One of the
fun things that I do during the regular school year is teach a class
at Georgetown, to graduate students. It is a fascinating time. They
are very, very bright young people. I learn a lot from them.

  But one thing I find is their sense of history, their sense of back-
ground, frankly, is not up to their abilities in other areas. I suspect
that because some want to avoid any potential problems with an
establishment of religion question, that society's response has been
to simply ban or restrict or prohibit or not teach anything relating
to religion. In other words, out of fear of someone accusing them
of fostering, or pushing, or assisting a particular religion, we have
almost banned the discussion of religion, religious backgrounds,
and religious history from our curriculums in school.
                                      211

  Is this what you think is necessary to prevent the establishment
of religion?

  Judge BREYER. Teaching history of religion, teaching history, his-
tory which involves religion, I do not know of any opinion that says
you cannot teach history. The question suggests to me what I very
much believe, which is the importance of clarity, the importance of
the Court making clear and separating what can be done from
what cannot be done, and understanding that a Court opinion is
going to be read by lawyers, other judges, school administrators,
and those who have to live under it.

  And what your question to me suggests is a concern that people
take an opinion that says don't do X, and then they incorrectly in-
terpret it to say we can't do Y. I think that that shows need for
the kind of clarity that will allow people to do what they are per-
mitted to do.

  Senator BROWN. I think you have hit the nail on the head. You
have described exactly what has happened. There are many who
are concerned that the way the Court has interpreted the establish-
ment clause in this country has led to a government establishment
of secularism. That is not my interpretation of what the Constitu-
tion means.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, you have hit the time over the head--
we are over a few minutes.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will wind up with
that. If the judge has any comments on that particular observation,
I would appreciate it.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, what we will do, we have gone now for
a little over an hour and a half, we will break until 12. Before we
do, let me explain what we will do after that. The schedule, after
consulting with my colleagues, is that we will then come back and
go from 12 until 1, with Senators Simon and Cohen, and then from
1 until 2 we will break for lunch, and we will come back. If Senator
Pressler is able to be here, we will start with him. If not, we will
then go to Senators Kohl, Feinstein and Moseley-Braun, last, but
not least, and then make a judgment of how we will proceed from
there.
  So we will now recess for 6 or 7 minutes until noon, and we will
come back with Senator Simon.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I now yield to Senator Simon.

                         FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I might mention I speak with some prejudice, because back in
1972 I lost a race for Governor in Illinois, and in the spring semes-
ter of 1973,1 was a guest lecturer at Harvard and met a young law
professor and his wife and, as I recall, two of the three members
of his family sitting here. I was very impressed then and have been
impressed through the years.

  I would like to enter into the record the letter from John Frank
on the whole question of ethical conduct. John Frank has testified
before us on several occasions.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think on every occasion we have ever had a
nominee.
  Senator SIMON. That is just about right. It makes very clear that
Judge Breyer's conduct has been within ethical bounds.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

Weuqart v. Allen & O'Uarxx, inc., 654 F.2d 1096,1107 (6th Cir. 1981). The judge
in Wangart owned threa lift inaurance policies, "representing mutual ownership" in
a corporation which wholly owned tat defendant corporations. Based in part on
Advisory Committee Opinion No. 62, that a judge insured by a mutual insurance
oompany is not disqualified to hear cases involving that company unless he was
also a stockholder, the court held 'the judge's mere ownership of three life
insurance policies, representing mutual ownership, in the parent corporation of a
party to the suit does not demonstrate that the outcome of the proceeding could
have substantially affected the value of the ownership interest" Id. at 1107.

ofApps. 198^ the oourt bald ajudge hawing « O«M invoking in Entitlement
Program, who hid stock ownership in other Entitlement Programs, WH not
disqualified. In reaching this conclusion the oourt UMdfttwo stop analysis; 1) did
the judge have afinancialinterest in the subject matter in controversy, and, ifnot,
2) did the judge have gome other interest that could be substantially affected by the
outoome of the litigation.

             The oourt held the judge did not hare aflwnwMinterest in the subject
matter ofthe litigation, wWi a brief analysis:

             The use of the term "subject matter" suggests that this provision of the
             statute will be most signiflrent bxinrttn proceedings. See E. Wayne
             Thode, Beporters Notes to AJ3JL Code of Judicial Conduct, 66 (1973).
             We hold that the judge does not have a direct economic or financial
             interest in the outcome of the case, and thus could hear it without
             contravening the constitutional due process.

             Here if where Judge Breyer drops completely out of the disqualification
ends. In theftoandalrelationship of SJ^ of bis ceees to the totalily of Us
dividend potential, hie Name is utterly trivial and, in any case, he not only does not
know that a litiganttoinsured with the syndicates but, realistically, has no
practical way offindingout As the legislative history dearly shows, it it intended
in these situations, generally speaking, that for a judge not to be kept currently
informed is an affirmative virtue, or else the persons controlling the investments,
as In a common fund situation, would have the power to disqualify a judge by
making an investment and forcing the knowledge on the judge. This was
deliberately considered in the legislative history as a hasard and was guarded
against An opinion, closely analogous, shared by several district judges, is whether
Alaskan district judges must disqualify in cases claiming 'amounts for the Alaska
Permanent Fund,fromwhich dividend* canflowto, among others, district judges.
Held, no disqualification; the amounts are too remote and speculative, Exxon Corp.
v. Heine*, 798 F. Supp. 77 (D. Ala. 1992). For perhaps the leading case that a
judge should not disqualify for a contingent interest where he is not a party but,
speeulativeJy, might get a small dividend some day, utlnrtVa. Site. Power Co.,
689 F.2d 867 (4th Or. 1976).

             This leaves the generalized provision of i 466(a) that a judge shall
disqualify where "his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." This is
eomiBonly caught up in the phrase which has a long history, pre-f 465 ABA and

  Senator SIMON. There is one question that has not been clarified
completely in connection with Lloyd's of London. You have talked
about the dates, and in 1988 you started to close those ties, and
in the 1970's purchased your interest. What is not part of the
record, and I think should be clarified by you for the record, is that
you were not on the court when you purchased your initial interest.
Is that correct?

  Judge BREYER. That is correct, and when I became a judge in
1980,1 disclosed it to the committee. That is correct.

  Senator SIMON. But the purchase was not at that point.
  It is interesting that next to the first amendment, the amend-
ment that has come up for questioning and referred to more often
than any other is the ninth amendment. One former appellate
court judge has called it an ink blot on the Constitution. You re-
ferred to the history yesterday. James Madison originally had 12
amendments he wanted on the Bill of Rights, but in sending them
around, he sent them, among other people, to Alexander Hamilton,
and Alexander Hamilton said if you spell these rights out, people
say these are the only rights people have. And so the ninth amend-
ment was added, which I think is an extremely important amend-
ment.
  We had a nominee before us a few years ago who said the ninth
amendment says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain
rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained
by the people. And he said that when they say "retained by the
people," that the Framers probably meant retained by the States.
That is a very different meaning. And as you look at the following
amendment, the 10th amendment, it differentiates between States
and the people.
  What is your construction? When the Constitution says "retained
by the people," what does it mean?
  Judge BREYER. Retained by the people, that is what I think it
means.
  Senator SlMON. Right. Then when it talks about unenumerated
rights, how do you, as a Supreme Court Justice, how do you deter-
mine what those unenumerated rights are?
  Judge BREYER. A very good question. It says that there are oth-
ers. It says don't construe the Constitution in such a way to deny
the existence of others. The word that protects the others is the
word "liberty" in the 14th amendment.
  What is the content of that word "liberty"? The general descrip-
tion given by Justices like Frankfurter or Harlan and others, those
rights that through tradition our people view as fundamental. That
is a phrase used. Concepts of ordered liberty, that is another. Over
time, the precedents have achieved a virtual consensus that almost
all the rights listed in the first eight amendments are part of that
word "liberty." And almost every Justice has said that there are
others, sometimes described as rights of privacy, and in various
other ways.
  Where does it come from? In deciding how to interpret that word
"liberty," I think a person starts with the text, for, after all, there
are many phrases in the text of the Constitution, as in the fourth
amendment, that suggest that privacy is important.
                                               223

  One goes back to history and the values that the Framers enun-
ciated. One looks to history and tradition, and one looks to the
precedents that have emerged over time. One looks, as well, to
what life is like at the present, as well as in the past. And one tries
to use a bit of understanding as to what a holding one way or the
other will mean for the future.

  Text, history, tradition, precedent, the conditions of life in the
past, the present, and a little bit of projection into the future, that
is what I think the Court has done and virtually every Justice.
That is not meant to unleash subjective opinion. Those are meant
to be objective, though general ways of trying to find the content
of that word.

  Senator SlMON. But the subjective enters into this, and there is
what Learned Hand called the spirit of liberty that has to pervade
things.

  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator SlMON. I do not mean to be putting words in your
mouth, but yesterday you talked about borderline cases, and that
is what you will be deciding to a great extent, will be borderline
cases. When we get to borderline cases in this area of liberty, it
seems to me if we are to err, it should be on the side of freedom.
You are nodding your head, but that cannot get into the record
here.
  Judge BREYER. YOU do not want to err, but you have to under-
stand--I do have to understand, and I think everyone understands
that the Constitution was written to protect basic freedoms, which
are basic values, which are related to the dignity of the human
being. That dignity of the human being is not something that
changes over time. The conditions that create the dignity may
change. The needs of the country for whatever conditions that will
permit the dignity may change, but the dignity is what stays the
same. And how to interpret the Constitution, that is the challenge.
That is the challenge.
  Senator SIMON. YOU have answered in response to several mem-
bers on questions of religious liberty. It has been about 5 years
since you have had to make a decision in this arena.
  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator SIMON. YOU have relied on the Lemon criteria, the
Lemon case, which the majority of the Court has relied on for some
time, and I believe are basically sound criteria. But there are two
members of the Court who differ with that conclusion. Obviously,
you cannot indicate how you might rule on anything, but since you
have used the Lemon criteria, you are familiar with it.
  Do you find the Lemon criteria basically sound criteria in line
with the spirit of the first amendment?
  Judge BREYER. What I have always thought is that perhaps the
disagreement is a disagreement more about communication than it
is about substance.
  The Lemon criteria say look to see if the Government has as its
purpose aiding religion. Look to see if the effect of the statute will
have a substantial aid to religion. Look to see if the courts or the
government becomes too entangled with religion.
  Those seem to me to be three helps, three things people might
want to look to, and that, I would suspect, is widely, widely shared.
                                                  224

I suspect the argument comes in when the people want to say, well,
those are the only possible things. Are they always determinative?
Should it be communicated in the form of an absolute test? Should
it be communicated in the form of, well, these things help you iden-
tify? That is where I think the area of disagreement likely lies.

  Senator SIMON. But the basic no excessive entanglement, that
there is a secular purpose, and it does not have the primary effect
of advancing or inhibiting religion, those criteria are not offensive
to you, if I can put it that way?

  Judge BREYER. NO, no; they seem important criteria, and it
seems to me that what will happen--I am guessing here, but I sus-
pect their exact shape, how absolute they are, how helpful the test
is, that perhaps is an area of disagreement; but that those are im-
portant factors. I suspect--I am suspecting now, because I am not
certain--that there is widespread agreement that those are helpful
ways of identifying constitutional problems. And there may be
other ways, and those ways may not always apply. But that is
what I think is the area 01 disagreement. That tney are helpful, I
suspect there is a lot of agreement about it. I am not positive.

  Senator SIMON. Jeff Rosen wrote in an article in the New Repub-
lic, commenting on Justice Blackmun's departure more than on
your ascendancy, but obviously including that, said that for the
first time since the 1920's the Court will not have someone who is
consistently speaking out for the least fortunate in our society. And
I quote him, "Ever since Brandeis, at least one Justice has felt in-
stinctive sympathy for people on the fringe of the political process."

  If Steve Breyer is approved, which I am confident you will be,
will there be someone who will speak for those who are least fortu-
nate in our society?

  Judge BREYER. I hope so. I hope so. I am not--normally, when
I write an opinion--and it may be different on the Supreme Court,
if I am there. Judge Wisdom gave me some good advice. He said:

  If you feel you want to write a purple passage because you feel so strongly, write
it, and do not use it. Because people want your result, they are not necessarily inter-
ested in your feelings.

  It does make me unhappy when I see an individual who is get-
ting a very bad deal. That does make me unhappy. I think it makes
everyone in this room unhappy. And as a judge, mostly what you
have as an appellate judge to give to that person is your time and
your effort. So if you think that is happening in an opinion or in
a case, you can read through the record with pretty detailed care.
And if it confirms that is what happened, what I will try to do is
set out the facts as dispassionately as possible, for the facts will
speak for themselves. And that can have an impact, too. That is
how I have approached it.

  Senator SIMON. In that connection, in the process of writing an
opinion, you said earlier today Arthur Goldberg's opinions were Ar-
thur Goldberg's opinions.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is true.
  Senator SIMON. Judges are a little bit like Senators. A staff per-
son can write a speech, and we can go over and deliver a speech
on the floor of the Senate, and it may be very little of the Senator.
A judge can have a clerk, for all practical purposes, write the opin-
ion.
                                             225

  I am interested in knowing how you go about writing an opinion.
Are the opinions that bear your name, are they Steve Breyer's
product? If you can comment just on the process because--and you
mentioned one other thing that is important, and perhaps because
of my background in journalism, every once in a while I read a
court decision that is so lacking in clarity, it is baffling to people
who read it. I would be interested in the process you go through
in writing an opinion.

  Judge BREYER. For better or for worse, my opinions are mine. I
do sit at the word processor. I do spend most of the day at the word
processors. I have learned the life of a Senator is different, and I
have learned some of the pressures that you are under. That is not
the life of a judge.

   Both the job itself--when I write an opinion, I have my law
clerks read the briefs before oral argument. I read the briefs before
oral argument. We sit down and we discuss the case. I send them
off to get any material I think will be relevant, like a statute that
I want underlined because I want to be able to read it if it is key
to the parties at oral argument.

  At the oral argument, you listen to both sides. And, interestingly
enough, most judges will tell you that the oral argument matters.
The law clerks often think it does not. But it does to the judge, be-
cause the attorneys know their case a lot better than I do, and you
learn what is important to them.

  Afterwards, when the opinion is assigned, I will send my clerks
out to do a long memo, and I tell them we both can do research
and we both can think. But in a pinch, I will do the thinking, you
see. Their job is to get that research done. And they get it done.

  And they come back in whatever form they want, a draft, a
memo, whatever. I take that. I read the briefs. I do not want them
to follow what they think I think. I want them to give me extra
input.

   Then I take their input, I take the briefs, I take the record. I sit
down at the word processor, and I write a draft. That draft is then
given back to the clerk, and we go back and forth like an editing
process. And, eventually--I would say it is rare that it is less than
3 drafts; on occasion, it has reached maybe 25. But, eventually, we
reach an opinion, a draft, which is basically my draft, edited,
reedited, reedited back and forth maybe four, five, or six times.
That is the process. And I have to be completely comfortable with
every word in my opinion before it goes out for circulation to the
other judges.

   Senator SIMON. And that strikes me as a very good process. Do
you intend to follow that process if you are approved by the Sen-
ate?

   Judge BREYER. I do; yes, I do.
   Senator SlMON. We face a problem occasionally, a question on
whom does the Constitution and the law protect. One of the worst
decisions in the history of U.S. Supreme Court was the Korematsu
decision which in large part dealt with Japanese-Americans, but
also dealt with those who were in this country legally but not
American citizens.
   We tend to face these problems in times of national passion.
When our hostages were held in Iran, President Carter issued a di-
                                               226

rective that Judge Green said was contrary to the law, that the
Constitution protects those who are here as guests of our country
legally, as well as American citizens.

  The appellate court--and, again, a little bit like the Korematsu
decision--in a time of passion ruled 2 to 1 against Judge Green.
I happened to think it was the wrong decision.

  But you have a decision in the case of U.S. v. Maravilla that
touches on this a little. I am interested in your perspective. Does
the Constitution, do our laws protect not just citizens of the United
States, but those who are not citizens who are here legally?

  Judge BREYER. The issue in that case, if I am remembering it
correctly, dealt with the word "inhabitant" in a statute. And I think
that the reason--am I remembering the right case? Was that
the

  Senator SIMON. I do not remember whether that
  Judge BREYER. Yes; I think it was.
  Senator SIMON. It was the case of a courier, someone who
was
  Judge BREYER. The courier, that is it.
  Senator SIMON. The courier who was in the United States just
for a day.
  Judge BREYER. That is right. That is right, exactly. The question
in the case was--so the answer to your question is yes, because the
problem with the case arose out of the fact that most of the civil
rights statutes use the word "person." And I think it was conceded
that if they had used in Congress, when they enacted that, that
word, there would have been protection for the courier who came
in in this case.
  The problem was that in a particular provision they used the
word "inhabitant," and so could you say--and that was the legal
issue. Could you say that a person who is only here for 2 or 3
hours, who is coming in as a courier and just leaving, was an in-
habitant? And that was what created all the agony and the dif-
ficulty in the case.
  But I think it was conceded by everyone that if Congress had
used the word "person"--and Congress does normally use the word
"person"--there would have been protection.
  Senator SIMON. And as far as you are concerned--first of all, I
would be interested in your reflections on the Korematsu case, if I
may.
  Judge BREYER. Of course, I think when there are pressures of
that sort, that is the time for a judge to stand up. I know it is dif-
ficult. That is what I always admired about Holmes. Holmes be-
lieved lots of deference is due the legislature. Pay a lot of attention
to the legislature. Let's have a lot of restraint on the judge's part.
But then when the right of free speech was infringed, suddenly
Holmes said, That is it, stop. And he stood up, even though it was
in dissent. So I think that is important in the case of a judge.
  The irony about Korematsu, of course, I have always thought--
and I have rather always admired Justice Murphy's opinion. I
think it was Murphy. Because the majority was obviously worried
in the case because it was a time of invasion or people were afraid
there would be an invasion from Japan. And so the Court was say-
ing, but could we as a Court really stand up to the public with the
                                               227

military and people worried about invasion? And that led them to
interpret the law a certain way.

  And what Murphy said was, wait a minute, I think this is 1944.
That is not 1941. Nobody thinks we are going to be invaded now.
So what is going on here and now. And if you want to say the law
might have been different then, say it. But what is going on right
now?

  Now, I may not remember that correctly, but I have always
thought that that was an important view because it says do what
you can. Even if somebody did something wrong before, that is no
need to follow it. He was in dissent, unfortunately.

  Senator SIMON. Your recollection is correct, and one of the iro-
nies, as you look back on this history, one of the people who said
that we should not issue that directive of February 1942 was
J. Edgar Hoover.

  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator SIMON. One of the persons you would least expect to do
that.
  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator SIMON. But your point that a judge should be willing to
do what is unpopular, just as Senators should be willing to do what
is unpopular, tell me something in the background of Judge Breyer
that indicates a willingness to stand up to do what is unpopular.
  Judge BREYER. Nothing that I could compare with those really
dramatic figures of the past. But many of the things I was engaged
in here--well, you listened to the discussion about sentencing
guidelines, or listened to some of the discussion about the airline
deregulation, or listened to the discussion about the book, and you
would not think I was moved by popularity in order to get into
that.
  But some of instances in the Commission or some of the in-
stances that occurred here are ones where I think people who knew
me at the time would say you can push me to a point, but not be-
yond. Not beyond. And once you get to that point, well, that is
what it is. That is what it is.
  Senator SIMON. And if we get to the point where the popular pas-
sion is on the one side and the Constitution is on the other
  Judge BREYER. It is the Constitution.
  Senator SIMON. There is no question in your mind where Steve
Breyer
  Judge BREYER. There is no question. That is what judges are
there for. That is why they are independent. That is why they are
there.
  Senator SIMON. Mandatory minimums has been talked about a
little bit here. Senator Heflin and Senator Kennedy, and I believe
Senator Brown also asked about them. You are correct. This is a
legislative responsibility, but it is also true that sometimes we need
judges to stand up and tell us to do what maybe we even instinc-
tively know is the right thing to do, but we get caught up in this
desire to do what may get us a few votes in the next election rather
than what is desirable.
  I just read yesterday a statement by Norman Carlson, you may
remember, former Director of the Bureau of Prisons under Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations.
                                             228

  Judge BREYER. Yes, I do.
  Senator SIMON. Highly respected. He says--this is in testimony
before the House:

   I believe that most individuals who seriously examine the Federal criminal justice
system would conclude that minimum mandatory sentences have produced results
which have not served the public interest and are costing the taxpayers a tremen-
dous amount of money.

  I happen to concur with that. Chief Justice Rehnquist has spoken
out on this.

  You are in a situation today, these 3 days, where you do not
want to offend any of us, and I understand that. I hope the time
will come when you may think it appropriate, if you feel a situation
is one that is deteriorating, where you will feel free at some judicial
conference or on some occasion to speak out on this issue. I just
pass that along because I think this is an area where we need the
judiciary to speak to us.

  Senator COHEN. If the Senator would yield, I believe Justice
Scalia is doing that on a frequent basis.

  Senator SIMON. And I welcome that, even though in the case of
Justice Scalia, I differ with just about everything he has to say.

  But I do think that you should not be--if you see a need, you
should feel free to speak out on it without entering into partisan
politics.

  You mentioned also in your opening statement--I thought it was
an excellent opening statement--that it is important for a judge to
be connected to the outside world, to understand the real world.
That is not easy for an appellate court justice. It is even more dif-
ficult for a Supreme Court Justice.

  Have you thought about how, as a member of the Court, you can
maintain contact with the real world? I mean the world that suf-
fers.

  Judge BREYER. Indirectly, of course, Joanna works with these
people all the time at Dana Farber, in the cancer hospital. Directly,
people have real problems, real problems.

  Justice Blackmun tried to work out ways of doing that. On my
part, the will is there, and I have worked out some ways of doing
that where I am in my present job. In the new job, if I am con-
firmed, the will being there, I would look for the possibilities, and
I would have to try to work out what I can do and what not. I
would try to do my best to get out a little bit of what I call the
cloistered chamber. I have been fairly imaginative, I think, at find-
ing ways. So I suspect I will find them.

  Senator SIMON. And I really think that is important, and mean-
ing no disrespect to those cancer patients, I think it means more
than that. I think it means reaching out to people who are unem-
ployed, who are hurting in our society. And somehow, because of
our system of campaign contributions and everything else, we are
not responding to them as effectively as we should.

  This is not something you are going to have to decide in a court,
but since your present jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico--and you
are testifying before us--my observation has been that on the legis-
lative side and on the executive side, Puerto Rico gets the short
end of the stick, for obvious reasons. There are not two U.S. Sen-
ators representing 3.7 million people. And so when we go through
                                      229
everything from minimum wage to health care legislation, to you
name it, it becomes very easy to ignore that side of things. And in
terms of appointments to the executive branch, again, Puerto Rico
gets the short end of the stick. And this is true in any administra-
tion. I am not faulting this administration.

  We have a system that we call a commonwealth, but it is a colo-
nial system, and one of these days Puerto Rico either is going to
become a State or is going to become an independent nation.

  But you have a chance to observe the judicial side, and my im-
pression is that the deficiencies we have on the executive and legis-
lative side, as far as Puerto Rico is concerned, are not there to the
same extent on the judicial side. Is that accurate? Or any observa-
tions you have in terms of how we are serving 3.7 million Ameri-
cans in Puerto Rico in the judiciary, I would be interested in hear-
ing them.

  Judge BREYER. It has been an enormous privilege for me to have
had Puerto Rico in the first circuit. You have no idea what a pleas-
ure, a privilege, it is. Puerto Rico is part of our circuit, and after
14 years, I feel part of Puerto Rico. That is the sort of place it is.
I mean, you are part of it. It is wonderful. And I think that the
need, the obligation, to pay attention to the people there is an im-
portant one. Their judicial system is an independent system. It is
a fine system. It is a system that rests on the civil code, as does
Louisiana, rather than the common law.

  We have a special obligation in the courts to become familiar
with that code so that in diversity cases, we can get the law right,
as the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would decide it, and we try
to fulfill that obligation.

  I think on the judicial side, as well as on the executive side and
the legislative side, I feel both emotionally and logically and in
every other way that it is very important to pay attention to the
people of Puerto Rico. They are part of us; we are part of them.

  Senator SIMON. Let me just follow up very briefly. But in terms
of our service to them on the judicial side, are we providing the
same service to the people of Puerto Rico that we would to the peo-
ple of Massachusetts or Illinois?

  Judge BREYER. The Federal district court there I think is. It is
a fine Federal district court. There are seven judges. I think that
it is an excellent court, and the facilities are supposed to be in
every way--and as far as I know, they are--comparable.

  There is also a different--an independent commonwealth system
of courts, which we as a Federal court interact with, because we
get to know the judges, and we understand their work, and there
are cases that go back and forth. But that seems a fine independ-
ent system. But our Federal court system in Puerto Rico with its
seven judges in the District of Puerto Rico is a fine system. The
present chief judge, a woman, Carmen Cerezo, is an excellent chief
judge, and there are some vacancies down there now which I think
are in the process of being filled.

  Senator SIMON. I thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is always a source of debate among Puerto
Ricans, who are American citizens, as to whether or not the Fed-
eral courts are sensitive enough to their Spanish culture. As you
                                              230

well know, one of the issues in every plebiscite that has been dis-
cussed is whether or not the courts should be Spanish speaking.
Federal courts are not; State courts are. It is a big deal, it is a big
issue. So the Federal courts do not in the eyes of most Puerto
Ricans meet the needs of Puerto Rico in the sense that they do not
take into consideration the Spanish culture, which the rest of the
Government of Puerto Rico and the rest of the court system does.
And it is always used as one of the red herrings in the debate that
takes place on statehood.

  And it is nice to hear that you have joined the Republican Party,
because only the Republican Party has suggested statehood for
Puerto Rico. The Democratic Party has not. I happen to think you
are probably right. But it is a very convoluted and controversial
and emotional debate, and the plebiscite last time was perilously
close, depending on how you view it. But the Federal courts are a
main source of contention in terms of whether or not they are
Spanish speaking. They would be the only Spanish-speaking courts
in the Federal system were they allowed to be, and as you know,
they are not.

  I yield to my friend from Maine.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM S. COHEN, A U.S.
                   SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MAINE

  Senator COHEN. On that note, perhaps I should begin by saying,
"Como esta usted, Mr. Chairman." [Laughter.]

  Yesterday you indicated that you were leery of flattery, so I will
dispense with allowing any to flow from this side of the bench, but
I might say that I found you to be enormously forthcoming, in
stark contrast to some of the nominees who have come before this
committee in the past.

  On my first day of law school, at the conclusion of the day, my
law professor said that any connection between law and justice is
purely coincidental. I thought he was engaging in some sort of pro-
fessorial cleverness at the time, until I went out to practice law,
and I found, as I started to lose all my cases, that I had justice on
my side, and my opponents had the law on their side.

  I raise this in connection with Judge Hand, of whom you are a
great fan. I was looking through his book, "The Spirit of Liberty,"
and he was talking about his relationship with Holmes, whom you
are also a great devotee of, in terms of his writings and decisions.
And Holmes used to frequently say, "I hate justice." Of course,
Hand would go on to say he really did not mean that, but he tried
to make the point that on one occasion when they were driving in
an automobile past the Supreme Court, when Holmes was going to
a weekly conference, Hand tried to pique him a little bit, and he
said, "Well, sir, goodbye. Do justice."

  Holmes turned around and snapped at him and said, "That is not
my job. My job is to play the game according to the rules."

  I listened to your opening statement about the need for the Jus-
tices, the court system, to strike some sort of a harmonious balance
in the lives of such a diverse population, to preserve liberty for as
many as possible, all if possible. At no time did you say that you
intended to do justice. I take it that your reluctance to do that was
the same for Holmes as well, of not seeking to do justice in the
                                      231

sense of intervening into an area that was properly before that of
the Congress or the State legislature. Is that how you would inter-
pret Holmes' statement that, "My job is not to do justice, but to
play the game according to the rules'?

  Judge BREYER. In part, yes, but I think that Holmes means more
than that. I think Holmes--and it is another reason I do admire
him--I think that he sees the rules from the time he wrote the
common law up through his Supreme Court career, I think he sees
all this vast set of rules as interrelated. And I suspect, although
I am not positive, that he sees ultimately the vast object of this
vast interrelated set of rules including rules that say whose job is
what as working out for society in a way that is better for people
rather than worse.

  I suppose when you say "Do justice," or you say, "No, no; I am
just following the rules," what you worry about is someone trying
to decide an individual case without thinking out the effect of that
decision on a lot of other cases. That is why I always think law re-
quires both a heart and a head. If you do not have a heart, it be-
comes a sterile set of rules, removed from human problems, and it
will not help. If you do not have a head, there is the risk that in
trying to decide a particular person's problem in a case that may
look fine for that person, you cause trouble for a lot of other people,
making their lives yet worse.

  So it is a question of balance, and I would say both.
  Senator COHEN. Judge, yesterday, you indicated that the black
robe had great symbolic significance, that when you placed that
robe around your shoulders, you were no longer speaking as an in-
dividual, and that you would convey to the litigants that the deci-
sions that were reached or rendered were done so irrespective of
personality, the personality of the judge. And then I think you
quoted Hand's speech about Cardozo in describing a judge as a
runner who is stripped for the race.
  I was interested in that, because Hand himself has written, in
this wonderful biography of Gerald Gunthers--he says, "A man
does not get to be a Justice of the Supreme Court chiefly because
he can detach himself from the convictions and prejudices of his
class or his time." Furthermore, Justice Cardozo, in his wonderful
book, "The Nature of the Judicial Process," also said, "In the long
run, there is no guarantee of justice except for the personality of
the judge."
  So both Hand and Cardozo would seem to contradict the notion
that once you put on the black robe, you in fact are one of these
blind oracles that simply dispassionately rule upon the law.
  I mention this in connection with who you are as a person. I
think that one of the goals of this type of hearing is to try to gauge
you as a person. In that connection, again I would turn to Hand,
because you have turned to him so many times during the course
of these proceedings. Hand said,

   I venture to believe that it is as important to a judge called upon to pass upon
a question of constitutional law to have at least a bowing acquaintance with Acton
and Maitland, with Thucydides and Gibbon and Carlyle and Homer and Dante,
Shakespeare, Milton, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Plato, Bacon, Hume, Kant,
as with the books that have been so specifically written on the subject, for

and the key words
                                              232

in such matters, everything turns upon the spirit in which he approaches the ques-
tions before him. The words he must construe are empty vessels into which he can
pour nearly anything he will.

  I think that is a terribly important statement that Hand made,
and I have listened to the introductions that were given yesterday
on your behalf, and I know that you are a learned individual who
has studied Spanish and is fluent in French and apparently reads
about architecture in his spare time and quotes from John Donne.

  If I went into your library and asked you to point at the 10 most
important books that you have there, what would you point to?

  Judge BREYER. Oh, my goodness.
  Senator COHEN. By the way, Holmes had 14,000 books in his li-
brary at the time he died.
  Judge BREYER. My goodness. My reading--people may exagger-
ate this a little bit in respect to me--my reading is not like the list
you just read.
  Senator COHEN. But the point that I make
  Judge BREYER. Where do you start? I mean, tell me your favorite
books--where do people start? They start with Shakespeare. They
say, "Why Shakespeare?" This is what I tell students. A lot of them
come from some different school, and they will come from some-
place, and they ask, "What is in Shakespeare for me?" You say,
well, if you are willing to put in the time, it is a little bit archaic,
the language, but if you put in the time, what you see there is you
see every different person, you see every different kind of person,
you see every situation there is in the world. You see people saying
things that they would say if only they had that ability to say
them, and you see the whole thing in poetry. That is why people
turn to that, and they turn to that a little bit in literature to get
some of the things that Senator Simon was talking about, I think,
which is what is in the heart of that person who is leading that
different kind of life. And sometimes you can find some of that in
literature.
  I like Conrad very much. Why? I think because I am moved often
by the way in which he talks about the need for people--all of us--
to learn from the past and then to give something to the future,
whether that is through our families or whether that is through
our careers. We do learn from our parents. We do learn from the
past. We do try to transmit things of value. And I think he finds
value in human communities. I think he finds human communities
to be, ultimately, the source of obligations and values toward each
other.
  I read something that moved me a lot not very long ago. I was
reading something by Chesterton, and he was talking about one of
the Brontes, Emily Bronte, I think, or "Jane Eyre" that she wrote.
He said if you want to know what that is like, you go and you look
out at the city, he said--I think he was looking at London--and he
said, you know, you see all those houses now, even at the end of
the 19th century, and they look all as if they are the same. And
you think all of those people are out there, going to work, and they
are all the same. But, he says, what Emily Bronte tells you is they
are not the same. Each one of those persons and each one of those
houses and each one of those families is different, and they each
have a story to tell. Each of those stories involves something about
                                               233

human passion. Each of those stories involves a man, a woman,
children, families, work, lives. And you get that sense out of the
book.

  So sometimes, I have found literature very helpful as a way out
of the tower.

  Senator COHEN. Judge, the reason I have taken the time to at
least touch on this however briefly is that I think that the people
who serve on the Supreme Court should be more than those who
are simply adept at a sort of mechanistic application of formulas
and rules, but who bring to that Bench a breadth of not only expe-
rience but of intellect and scope and depth, so that when they
render those decisions, they will carry that much more in the way
of impact and consequence.

  I would like to now turn to something more specific in terms of
issues that have been raised with you. You indicated before that
the death penalty, under certain circumstances, is not cruel or un-
usual. The Court has ruled that, and you accept that as settled
law.

  Judge BREYER. I do.
  Senator COHEN. The question I wanted to ask you, however, is
whether you believe the death penalty to be cruel under any cir-
cumstances, or only under some.
  Judge BREYER. Oh, I would say it is equally settled that there
are some circumstances where it is cruel and unusual; for exam-
pie
  Senator COHEN. No, no, that is not what I am asking.
  Judge BREYER. YOU want my personal view.
  Senator COHEN. I want your personal view, not whether it is set-
tled or not, but what you believe.
  Judge BREYER. The reason that I hesitate to say what I think as
a person as opposed to a judge is because down that road are a
whole host of subjective beliefs, many of which I would try to ab-
stract from, because as you have had and I have had from Learned
Hand and other great judges, there are some to both sides of this.
I was pointing out those things where he says try to be dispassion-
ate. And you must remember that the law that you are trying to
find as a judge in your own mind, think that what you have found,
you must be satisfied that other people would find the same--not
every other person, but lots of other people.
  Where the subjective belief may come in, and that happens some-
times where it is either relevant to the law, or it is not. If it is rel-
evant to the law, decide it as a matter of law. If you know it is not
relevant to the law, then the only time at which it enters is if you
think the law is one way, and you think your own subjective belief
is the other way, and you feel that you cannot follow what you be-
lieve the law to be because of your subjective belief, then do not
try; then do not try. You can remove yourself from the case.
  Senator COHEN. Well, the other option, however, is to overturn
the prior decision.
  Judge BREYER. NO, but you see
  Senator COHEN. I am going to come to this in a moment. We will
talk about stare decisis, and I will quote from Holmes about rules
that are laid down at the time of Henry IV, and that we ought to
have something more substantive than the fact that it was laid
                                         234

down years in the past, so that you do not have the dead hand of
the past controlling, and that type of line of argument.

  But I would like to know your personal view, because that be-
comes important. You may find yourself somewhere down the line
in which this kind of an issue may come up. And the question is
are you going to subordinate your personal views in terms of what
you believe, what you in your heart--you talked about the mind
and the heart--believe to be the right thing to do under the cir-
cumstances, whether it amounts to cruel punishment under any
circumstances. The fact is you have a choice. You can either, if you
feel so passionately about it, remove yourself from the case, or say
I think the Court that decided such-and-such a case was wrong,
and I am now voting to overturn that. That is another option you
can pursue, and a lot will depend upon how you view stare decisis,
whether it is a decision that was reached 50 years ago, or 5 years
ago, or 5 days ago.

  But I think that you cannot simply say that, well, I would always
apply the rule as established by the Court in 1850, or 1950.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is right.
  Senator COHEN. So I think your personal view is relevant in this
case, and I do not think you have stated it yet.
  Judge BREYER. That is true, and I think that the law itself pro-
vides ways of departing from past law. There are circumstances in
which it is appropriate according to the law to depart from the
prior decision. Those have been listed by the Supreme Court re-
cently. You look to the earlier decision and you ask how wrong was
that decision. You look to see the ways and the extent to which the
law has changed in other related ways. You look to see the extent
to which facts have changed. You look to see how much difficulty
and trouble that old rule of law that seems badly reasoned has cre-
ated as the courts have tried to apply it. And then, going the other
way, you look to see the extent to which there has been reliance
on that old past law.
  The reason I say this is because I think the law has ways of over-
coming prior decisions, and those ways, too, permit a judge to ab-
stract from a belief that he would think is highly personal and not
relevant.
  Sometimes, of course, the belief is totally relevant. After all, if
you think there is some terrible injustice, maybe there is. And that
is not just an abstract belief of yours. That is not just something
subjective. Maybe there is. And if you see there is, that suggests
there is something odd about this law that requires thought.
  Senator COHEN. Let me turn in that vein to McCleskey v. Kemp.
You are familiar with that decision.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes.
  Senator COHEN. I want to just ask you to tell us whether or not
you agree with the rationale of the five-member majority, or the
dissent, characterized by Justice Stevens. Let me just summarize
the finding of the majority, that the study that was submitted by
the plaintiffs in this particular case at most indicated a discrepancy
that appeared to correlate with race, not a constitutionally signifi-
cant risk of racial bias affecting Georgia's capital sentencing proc-
ess, and thus did not violate the eighth amendment. So the study
                                             235

in that particular case was given rather short shrift by the major-
ity.

  In the dissent, Justice Stevens said:

  The studies demonstrate a strong probability that McCleskey's sentencing jury,
which expressed the community's outrage, had sensed that the individual had lost
his moral entitlement to live, was influenced by the fact that McCleskey is black,
his victim was white, and that this same outrage would not have been generated
had he killed a member of his own race. This sort of disparity is constitutionally
intolerable. It flagrantly violates the Court's prior insistence that capital punish-
ment be imposed fairly and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.

  So I would like your opinion as to whether you agree with the
reasoning of Justice Stevens or that of the majority.

  Judge BREYER. The case was decided. It is the opinion of the
Court. I have not read it with enough care and thinking it out thor-
oughly to know the rights and wrongs of if I were deciding it
afresh, but it would not be afresh, and to be--I know this is a big
issue in Congress. I know that you are considering legislation

  Senator COHEN. Before we get to Congress, I do not want to talk
about Congress. I want to talk about the use of statistical informa-
tion before the Court. For example, in Massachusetts Association of
Afro-American Police, Inc. v. Boston Police Department--I believe
that was a case you decided in 1985

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. You allowed an affirmative action
program to stand because the plaintiff had shown a consistent pat-
tern of discrimination within the department. So there, you found
a statistical analysis to be substantive, persuasive, and therefore
allowed the affirmative action program to stand.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator COHEN. Now, in that case, Congress is not involved.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator COHEN. So what I am asking you is if you have the same
sort of statistical analysis prepared in a case involving racial dis-
parity in capital cases, does it need an act of Congress, in your
judgment, to set the law?
  Judge BREYER. The question of statistics, as I have said, is their
danger is that they are not really good statistics and do not prove
what they say. That means when you have good statistics, they can
be used to prove what they say.
  Senator COHEN. I know you said there are statistics, and there
are statistics.
  Judge BREYER. Exactly.
  Senator COHEN. Let me turn instead to Holmes who, instead of
that, said that the history of the law is not logic, but experience;
or a page of history is worth more than a volume of logic. Is there
no doubt in your mind that there is a deep-seated racism that has
existed in this country for many, many years; that there has been
great disparity in terms of the capital punishment that has been
inflicted upon those who are in the minority versus those in the
majority? Has that not been the experience of this country, histori-
cally?
  Judge BREYER. Historically, in the simplest way, the Constitution
was written; the Constitution provided a limited central govern-
ment that was meant to secure liberty, and a Bill of Rights was
added to guarantee liberty. And one thing was missing. What was
                                               236

missing was what the 14th amendment added, which was a prom-
ise of fairness. And what had existed before could not have been
more unfair. After that promise was made in the 14th amendment,
decades went by before people tried to keep the promise.

  With Brown--and it is a legal reason, as well as a moral, prac-
tical and every other reason--the country decided we will try to
keep our promise. It is hardly surprising to me, given the prior sit-
uation and given the years of neglect, that it will be decades, dec-
ades before that promise is eventually kept. But we are trying, and
the trying is absolutely correct.

  Senator COHEN. I come back to the point with the use of statis-
tical information combined with the history of the practice in this
country. Do you feel that the Court, in McCleskey v. Kemp, reached
the right result?

  Judge BREYER. Yes; and I think you are absolutely fair to ask the
question, and I think it is so closely tied up with the particular leg-
islation and the particular political debate, and so forth, that I am
uncomfortable with

  Senator COHEN. Let me ask you a different way, then. In the
event that the anticrime bill passes with the Racial Justice Act in-
tact, which is a big question, does that settle the issue? In other
words, is the Court then precluded from examining the statistical
viability or accuracy of the information at that point?

  Judge BREYER. There I am stuck, because I don't know. I don't
know what the bill says. I am not being coy at this point. It is that
I don't really know.

  Senator COHEN. But you said yesterday that the Congress will
decide it and the Court will accept it.

  Judge BREYER. The Court then will go and accept what Congress
does, and unless there is some constitutional problem--and I don't
know, I mean at this stage maybe somebody will come along and
say there is one, I don't know what it is--sure, it is up to Congress.
I reserve a lot on that, because I don't know what the argument
is.

  Senator COHEN. Let me turn quickly to habeas corpus. This also
is a matter of considerable debate here in the Congress. Back in
1988, the Judicial Conference was then headed by Chief Justice
Rehnquist, and he commissioned the conference to make a study
that was chaired by Justice Powell. Justice Powell concluded that
habeas corpus was being used frivolously as a tactic to postpone
the imposition of death penalty, rather than review the constitu-
tionality of the trial.

  There is considerable debate here in the Senate and the House
on trying to strike the balance between finality and fairness of the
process and between the two issues that frequently come up, name-
ly, retroactivity and full and fair hearing. I would like your view
on whether or not you feel the habeas corpus process has been
abused to frivolously appeal convictions and delay decisions and
sentences. And I know you come from a circuit that does not have
many cases which are capital cases.

  Judge BREYER. In our circuit, I have never sat on a capital case.
I think the only State that has the .death penalty is New Hamp-
shire, and it has not applied it, at least not in any cases, so I have
never had any experience with this in the death penalty context.
                                             237

  In the other context, the normal nondeath penalty context, I
have no reason to think there is a particular problem. It seems to
work OK. It seems to work OK.

  Senator COHEN. One of the suggestions that has been made is
that perhaps if defendants had competent counsel in the first in-
stance, then there would be fewer reasons to have these habeas
corpus petitions. I frankly take issue with that. I think a person
could have the best counsel possible, and whenever someone is con-
victed, the first thing they are going to do is file a petition for ha-
beas corpus, alleging incompetent counsel. That was my experience
when I was practicing law, and I think it will be the experience
from now into the future.

  But do you have any views about whether having a cadre of pro-
fessional litigants, defense counsel, would do anything to reduce
the flow of petitions for habeas corpus in capital cases?

  Judge BREYER. I really don't, because of my lack of experience in
that area. I think that you correctly identified what I think are the
two basic considerations.

  Senator COHEN. Let me turn quickly--I keep saying quickly, as
the lunch hour is approaching and past--to the fourth amendment.
I am not sure who earlier touched upon the notion of losing per-
spective on what is going on. But we know that ours has become
an increasingly more violent society and, as a result of that vio-
lence, we are taking and perhaps compromising some of the rights
that we cherish most.

  Recently--and I will yield to my colleague from Illinois in a mo-
ment--to cite as an example: all Chicago public housing leases con-
tain a clause that grants law enforcement officials the right to
search an apartment. Interestingly enough, some of the residents
who are directly affected favor it most. But I would like to read
again from a letter that Holmes wrote to his friend Polly.

  He said:

  The tendency seems to be toward underrating or forgetting the safeguards and
Bills of Rights that had to be fought for in their day and they are still worth fight-
ing for. I have had to deal with cases that made my blood boil, and yet seemed to
create no feeling in the public or even most of my brethren. We have been account-
able for so long, that we are apt to take it for granted that everything will be all
right, without taking any trouble.

  Then he went on to note "all of which is but a paraphrase that
eternal vigilance is the price of freedom."

  I mention this, because there is again concern that we are mov-
ing into a more repressive area, that because of the violence in our
society, the pervasive fear that is generated, we may tend to allow
the Government in the form of the police, the FBI, or any other law
enforcement agencies to perhaps do things that in the past we
would say, hold it, that violates our right of privacy.

  I mention this in connection with--is it Irizzary, the case that
you decided, I-r-i-z-z-a-r-y? Anyway, you will be familiar with it. It
was U.S. v. Irizzary in 1982. It involved an individual who was in
a motel room.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, I remember that.
  Senator COHEN. YOU remember that case?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
                                               238

  Senator COHEN. In that case, the majority held that the police,
who conducted a warrantless search, had violated the defendant's
fourth amendment rights. You dissented in that case, believing
that the defendant had no such right of privacy, or he had a dimin-
ished right of privacy by virtue of being, first, in a motel room, and,
second, by the fact that he had punched a hole in the ceiling to
hide some illegal substance, and, therefore, his right of privacy was
not as expansive as it ought to be.

  I mention all of this in conjunction with what is taking place
today, because I think that we are losing sight of the fact of what
is happening to our fundamental rights. The case I really want to
talk about is the case, if I can pronounce it correctly, California v.
Sarola, in which the police were hovering above in a helicopter, as
I recall, being able to detect the growing of marijuana at a person's
residence, in a fenced-in yard.

  The court ruled that he did not have a legitimate expectation of
privacy under those circumstances, because it was visible from an
aerial viewpoint. It raised a question in my mind, as we and Sen-
ator Biden and others who have served on the Intelligence Commit-
tee have come to appreciate the tremendous technology that is
available to us. We can from distant space spot a soccer ball on a
field. We can read a license plate from outer space, practically.

  The impact of technology upon fundamental rights is in danger
of being eroded, unless we insist that technology cannot intrude in
that area. That is why I was concerned about the rationale in the
California v. Sarola case, that the expectation of privacy was un-
reasonable, because something was observable from an aerial view-
point. With satellites we can pick out almost anything from outer
space now.

  I was wondering what your views are in terms of this so-called
zone of privacy. The First Lady has complained that she had ex-
pected some de minimis zone of privacy that might be allowed her,
as First Lady, and she found that that was a false expectation. But
there is quite a difference between a public person and a private
citizen in terms of what is a reasonable expectation of privacy and
an era in which technology is proceeding in such a pace that we
will approach the Orwellian nightmare that literature provides for
us.

  Judge BREYER. Insofar as you are suggesting that you have to re-
member that privacy is what Brandeis said is the most civil and
the most important right of civilized people, and so forth, is a right
that really is protected by the fourth amendment against unreason-
able searches, unreasonable seizures.

  Insofar as you are suggesting beware of fixed rules interpreting
that, because if you just follow fixed rules, you will discover that
technology outdates the rules, and remember to protect the basic
value which might be threatened by some kind of technology that
we have not heard of, or that we have heard of but we didn't know
could get that far. I agree with that.

  Senator COHEN. Could you explain the case, if you can recall
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I do remember. I thought that the case, as
I recall it--I might not be recalling it correctly--I think what I was
not in disagreement about was the nature of the right. I think I
                                      239
was in disagreement about the circumstance. I think what hap-
pened was that there were some police staking out a hotel or a
motel, and they looked through the window and they see these peo-
ple in there with guns that are pointed out. You know, these were
some drug guys. I think it was a drug bust. And they were pointing
the guns out the windows, so the police said we had better be care-
ful about this.

  The man was sitting--I think there was one man and he was in-
side, and they burst in and they found him sitting on the bed and
they handcuffed him to the bed, and they looked for the gun and
they didn't see it. But the knew the gun was there, because they
had seen it through the window. Indeed, in the bathroom, I think
up above the toilet there was a hole, and what the police had done
is one of them went into the bathroom and reached up and there,
sure enough, was the gun.

  Basically, we were in agreement about the rule of law that the
police had a right, even without a warrant, to go look for that gun,
if they reasonably thought they were in danger. And the majority
thought, no, no, they are not in danger, because, after all, this guy
is handcuffed to the bed. I thought, well, a handcuff, you know, a
lot can happen. I mean they might say, "I want to go to the bath-
room," and they unlock it, he knows the gun is up there, they do
not, I don't know how strong the bed is, and so in my mind is that
the police were reasonable in thinking that there was a danger,
and they knew there was a gun there and so they ought to look
for it. In a factual matter, the others came out the other way.

  Senator COHEN. I have exhausted my time, Mr. Chairman. I
have other questions in the second round, and I will defer them.
Thank you.

  Thank you very much, Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  With regard to schedule, we have necessarily gone over--Senator
Cohen has not gone over, but because of the timing, we did not fin-
ish this round at 1. We will come back at 2:15, unless you all want
it to be longer. We will come back at 2:30.
  Second, I would like to ask staff present here if they would sur-
vey their bosses to find out whether those who have already had
a first round, and four or five have not, whether they have an in-
terest in asking a second round of questions, and, if so, how long.
  Because I would like, if it is reasonably possible, to finish with
the witness tonight, since tomorrow we will go into what I initiated
in the last hearing. It is now standard operating procedure that
there is a closed session that every nominee who will come before
this committee will participate in, where we go over, under rule 26
of the Senate, those matters that we are not able to discuss in pub-
lic, that is, the FBI report. And we are going to, in every Supreme
Court nomination that I chair, go into that hearing, whether we
need it or not, so that is the forum in which we will be able to dis-
cuss openly, without fear of inadvertently violating the law, the
contents of FBI reports.
  What is in an FBI report, for those of you who are new covering
this or listening, every nominee is required to have an FBI report
done, and so we are going to discuss that tomorrow morning, which
will require the presence of the nominee. But I would hope that we
                                              240

would finish the public testimony tonight. Obviously, there is no
need to rush it. If people have second rounds and they wish to go,
we will have to go tomorrow afternoon in finishing. So I would ask
the staff to check with their principals, if they have a second
round.

  We will adjourn now, Judge, until 2:30, at which time we will
come back and begin with Senator Kohl. He has to be downtown
at a meeting, but either Senator Kohl or Senator Feinstein.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  [Whereupon, at 1:22 p.m., the committee was in recess, to recon-
vene at 2:30 p.m., the same day.]

                                  AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge. I realize it was a short lunch break, but
I hope you at least got something to eat.
  Our next questioner is Senator Pressler.
  Senator PRESSLER. NO, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. Let me make sure I am correct.
  Senator PRESSLER. I think my colleague over there
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon. Senator Kohl. I am sorry.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S.
               SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, as you know, John Adams once said that we are
a government of laws and not men. But this is, at most, a half
truth, for ultimately it is men and women who give meaning to the
law. And so it follows that character matters, and matters a great
deal.
  Character is not only to be found in the lines of your very im-
pressive resume, Judge Breyer; it is also to be appreciated in the
exchange of ideas and values and viewpoints that began yesterday
and which we are continuing today.
  I have first a few open-ended questions that I would like to
throw at you.
  Judge Breyer, yesterday you said that your mother did not want
you to spend too much time with your books, and because of her
urgings, you said that your ideas about people do not come from
libraries. So I want to ask you something about people, the Amer-
ican people, and the problems that we face today as a Nation. And
I hope that you will very much take this opportunity to speak open-
ly and frankly, and perhaps not as a nominee for the Supreme
Court but as an American citizen who is intelligent and thoughtful
and who has, I know, thought long and hard about the problems
that we face as a country.
  Judge Breyer, what do you think are the major challenges that
we face today as an American society, our problems, whether it be
racism, poverty, crime, or drugs, the growing disparity between the
rich and the poor in our country? What are some of our major prob-
lems? And as we look ahead, how do you think we are going to face
and resolve one or two of these major problems as a society?
                                      241

  Judge BREYER. I think, Senator, this document, which is a kind
of miracle, the Constitution, has enabled so many different people
in this country to produce a government that is reasonably effec-
tive, that is democratic in its origin, that permits them individual
liberty, and that moves in the direction of fairness.

  You know and I know that over the course of the 19th century
and the 20th century, our country has become ever more diverse
in terms of the groups of people who are here. And the problem at
one level is what it has always been: How do these very, very dif-
ferent groups of people manage to live together in a spirit of toler-
ance, understanding, freedom, fairness, and cooperation that will
permit them to build better lives for each other?

  That requires a degree of trust in government, because govern-
ment is the people working together to solve their problems. It re-
quires not too much delegation of authority to government, lest
that government turn on them and deprive them of liberty. It re-
quires people working together to produce an economy that can
feed them all and give them decent standards of living, while at
the same time they share the fruits of that economy so no one is
left out.

  What tremendous problems, when there are so many people who
are left out. What tremendous problems, when, in fact, we are in
a world where we have to work so very hard to have that economy
working, producing. What tremendous problems, when, in fact, we
are so far from the ideal of fairness that the Constitution pre-
scribes. The ne"ed for trust, the need to compete in this technical,
scientific world where it is so hard to produce a productive econ-
omy, the need to share around the results so that people are not
left out. And to do all that while maintaining the basic liberty that
this document promises.

  Those are all the basic problems that I see underneath your
words, the words of crime in the cities, lack of education, groups
of people that do not enjoy prosperity, the need to keep jobs so that
people are at work. All those are symptoms of what I see as those
four or five basic problems. That is a challenge for everyone in gov-
ernment, in your branch as well as in the judicial system. And it
is a challenge for everyone who is not in government because every
single American--I say "us." We are all in this together. We are all
in this together.

  That is how I respond, briefly, to what you put.
  Senator KOHL. Well, perhaps you can say a few more words. I
appreciate your willingness to talk openly and frankly about this.
I think those of us that are listening and watching wonder, other
than what I believe what you said is that we must look to the Con-
stitution and try to figure out ways together as a people--and
maybe that is what you are saying. Let's talk about the growing
inequality between the rich and the poor. That is a statistical
measure. It is not an opinion.
  How do you see us as a society responding to that problem, if you
see it as a problem? Again, this is not as a Supreme Court nomi-
nee. This is more as a person who may well sit on the Court and
may have to confront these questions in a larger way. So maybe
as a nominee, but it certainly is as a thoughtful American and as
                                               242

a person who we are all interested in, what are your thoughts in
addition to constitutional issues?

  Judge BREYER. I do not claim any special thought or any deeper
thought or any special privilege for thought in this area any more
than any other American in this country. Every American is trying
to earn a living. They are trying to raise a family. They look out
and see a lot of crime in the streets. They see a lot of people who
are really badly off. They see promises of fairness that are not ful-
filled.

  They are concerned about their Government. They have to write
the check for the car and they have to write the check for the rent,
and they have to get their children educated. Life is not necessarily
easy for many, many people. And the problem of the country, I do
not know, more than that, that is what you would get out of read-
ing a newspaper and out of opening your eyes and looking around.

  I think that the challenge for us is to try to make that a little
bit better.

  Senator KOHL. Well, there are some people who would look at
the statistical difference in terms of wealth between those who are
extremely well off and most everybody else in our society and re-
solve this growing disparity as something that is just a fact of life
and that these things come and go. There are some who would look
at it and say this is not a positive trend in our country.

  How would you look at it?
  Judge BREYER. It is not a positive trend. I have known--some
people are better off than other people. I understand that. And
those who are better off, in my view, including me, frankly, have
an obligation with every additional penny to give back something
to other people, because it is there in a kind of trust. And the only
reason we have a society of differences between rich and poor at
all is because, in principle, that is supposed to work out, so that
even those who are worse off are better off than they would be in
some other society.
  And that is why I spoke rather strongly about antitrust because
then you are getting back into my area of law, and why I felt so
strongly about it, because unless you have a policeman like that,
then those who are better off are just going to be better off and
that is the end of it. But you cannot have that. You have to have
a society in which those who are better off understand their obliga-
tions towards those who are worse off. And that is what I think.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Well, we will get to antitrust a little
later.
  Judge Breyer, I would like to ask you this: In your opinion, what
do you think are the three most important Supreme Court cases of
the 20th century? And why?
  Judge BREYER. Well, the first is easy. I mean, the first is Brown
v. Board. And why that is so easy is because, to me, it was clear.
I mean, you know, here is the promise in this document, and the
promise is the country will be fair. And they wrote it sometime in
the middle, last part of the 18th--you know, in the 19th century,
and then it was not done. How shocking. How shocking to write a
promise like that into the Constitution and it is not done. And it
seems to me that Brown was a decision of courage, in a sense, but
                                               243

the courage was do what the law says. Read it. That is what it
says. We are going to do it.

  I think the judges and everyone else involved in that, good, they
were behaving like judges and they were following the law.

  Now, a second one, I will tell you, is a little bit, perhaps not as--
but I have always felt this is awfully important, and I said this,
actually, to the group of Russians: Cooper v. Aaron. Why do I say
Cooper v. Aaron? It is interesting. Cooper v. Aaron, which you may
or may not remember, was the case in Arkansas where paratroop-
ers were sent to enforce school desegregation. Every judge on the
Supreme Court signed his own name to that opinion. What that
said is we mean it. But, of course, they are only nine human
beings. Nine human beings cannot stand up against a mob of peo-
ple, particularly if they are led by armed people who do not want
them to do it.

  So what it required was that the President of the United States,
representing the entire country, said they said it and it will be
done. And the paratroopers were sent down to see that it was done.
And the reason that I think that is so important is because that
means that, as a Nation, these words on paper are not words on
paper. They are real. And that was a definite, firm commitment to
that principle. And I think that is a very important decision, the
way that was carried out, for that reason.

  Then if you want to go to third, I tend to think of Holmes and
Brandeis, as you know, and the dissents in the first amendment
area, though they are not decisions, they are dissents. But those
dissents played an enormously important role in making certain
that freedom, freedom of speech was real.

  So those are the things that come into my mind.
  Senator KOHL. I think those are three very good choices.
  Judge Breyer, I would like to turn to questions on a few specific
topics. There are many judges and lawyers today who believe that
the sole purpose of the civil justice system is to settle disputes be-
tween private parties. Others, including your colleague, Judge
Mikva, say that because the courts are public institutions, they
must also consider and look out for the public interest, to the ex-
tent that it is affected by civil litigation.
  You yourself alluded to this yesterday when you told Senator
Leahy, and I quote, that "the courts belong to the public."
  Where do you come down on this question, Judge Breyer? Is our
civil justice system simply about private disputes, or is there more
to it than that?
  Judge BREYER. More to it than that. I mean, that is my short an-
swer. The object is dispute resolution. Dispute resolution is impor-
tant. There are other methods of dispute resolution. But dispute
resolution on what terms? Dispute resolution on terms of what is
fair. Then you get back into the court system.
  You have to be careful of saying it is just resolving disputes, be-
cause you might be resolving disputes on terms that are not fair.
You do not want the stronger party always to win. That solves it,
but it is not fair.
  Senator KOHL. OK; I am glad we share that belief, because
courts cannot afford to ignore the public interest in civil litigation,
and we agree on that.
                                               244

  My concern, however, Judge Breyer, is that courts are not strik-
ing the right balance today between the public and the private in-
terest. Consider, for example, the troubling use of protective orders
and confidentiality orders by courts today. In some cases, these or-
ders shield the public and regulators from crucial information
about dangerous and defective products that are discovered in the
course of litigation. Court secrecy has prevented the public and reg-
ulators from learning about many dangerous products, for example,
silicone breast implants, defective heart valves, automobiles, and
playground equipment.

  Now, obviously, courts need to balance the need for privacy
against the need for openness and disclosure, but in many cases to-
day's balance seems less a balance than a knee-jerk preference for
privacy and private parties and against the public interest and dis-
closure.

  And so, Judge Breyer, I would like to ask you whether or not you
share my view that some judges today are too quick to sanction
confidentiality without looking carefully enough at the public inter-
est in disclosure of information regarding dangerous products.
Shouldn't the courts at the very least be required to consider public
health and safety before allowing for secrecy in civil litigation?

  Judge BREYER. What you are focusing on specifically is not when
a Government agency or a State agency tries to obtain information
about public health and safety, for, obviously, there are broad dis-
covery powers as there should be in the hands of any governmental
agency.

  Really you are focusing upon two private individuals who are in
a private dispute, and sometimes, in the course of that dispute,
something will turn up, and the question is: When should it be
made public even though one of the parties where it came from
does not want it made public?

  Now, that kind of answer to that kind of question obviously re-
quires weighing the very important interests that you talked about
against the interests of privacy. I do not guarantee it is always
done properly. It would be amazing if it were always done properly.
It would be the only aware that I am aware of--I mean, always,
always, there can be mistakes in that area. But I really think it
is up to you in Congress to review this kind of thing systematically.
And if you think the line is now not being drawn properly as a gen-
eral matter, then you can change that line.

  Senator KOHL. All right. If I may just ask the question again and
answer if you want--I said, Don't you believe that courts should be
required--required--to consider the public health and safety before
allowing for secrecy in civil litigation? Consider, if courts should be
required to consider public health and safety.

  Judge BREYER. The reason I was putting it in terms of line-draw-
ing is perhaps it seems obvious to me that in terms of some level
of health and safety, of course, of course, no court can or should
stand silent when they see an immediate, serious risk to some
third party's health or safety. No lawyer can remain silent. No doc-
tor can remain silent.

  Senator KOHL. But as you know, there have been several, if not
numerous, cases where two parties in a court dispute before a
judge will make a secret court settlement involving a product being
                                               245

used widely but having affected just that one person. It has hap-
pened many times--heart valves, automobiles, silicone breast im-
plants--where a court allowed a settlement to be made between
two parties in court, full well knowing that that settlement meant
that tens of thousands, if not millions of people who were similarly
involved with the defective product would, therefore, not know of
the defective product.

  You are, of course, I am sure, fully familiar with this. And what
I am saying is: Don't you believe that a judge should be required
to consider public health and safety before that judge allows a se-
cret court settlement of this sort to occur in his court or her court?

  That is somewhat of a departure from what you know is the
present norm.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, and why I am being hesitant is really be-
cause I suspect it is a question of changing a legislative standard
in general. And I worry that this is somehow going to be coming
in front of the Court in terms of an appropriate court rule or in
terms of balancing privacy interests. And so I am hesitant to go be-
yond the general statement. Do you see why I am hesitant to go
beyond that? Because it is not something I know enough about to
be confident that I am not expressing a view there on something
that is likely to come up. That is my hesitancy.

  So I sort of feel the general principle, that, of course, when you
are a judge, as any other person, of course when you are a judge
and you see a real threat to health and safety, of course you have
to tell people about it. You cannot let--I mean, that seems to me
absolutely clear. And then going beyond that, as to just in what
cases and how you draw that line and so forth, that is something
I have to hesitate. I have to hesitate.

  Senator KOHL. Well, I think I hear you saying you agree, but.
But you agree.

  Judge BREYER. I agree, but.
  Senator KOHL. And I understand that. I understand what you
are saying. All right.
  I would like to ask a couple questions or thoughts about first
amendment and TV violence, Judge Breyer. As you may know,
Congress and the American people, including myself and Senator
Simon and others, have been looking at the effects of media vio-
lence on children. Clearly, media violence, whether it is on our TV
screens or in our contemporary music or in video games that we
purchase for our children, clearly media violence contributes to vio-
lence in our society.
  While other things are also factors, like the breakdowns in our
society with respect to crime and drugs and families, the fact that
these conditions are present does not excuse the excesses of those
in the media who peddle violence to our children. And when I talk
to people, they agree, and they ask me why Congress or Govern-
ment is not doing something about it.
  It is not always easy to explain the problems associated with the
effort to regulate media violence without threatening free speech.
However, freedom of speech is not absolute, for, after all, you can-
not yell "Fire" in a crowded theater.
                                               246

  Judge Breyer, we all know that it is sometimes appropriate and
necessary to enact and uphold reasonable restrictions on speech,
and I am sure that you agree.

  Suppose that Congress passed a law to ban or restrict the broad-
cast of TV violence during non-news programs or to set time limits
on when violent programs could be shown. If you were called upon
to review such a statute or a regulation, what kinds of issues would
you consider in your analysis, and what methodology would you
use?

  Judge BREYER. It is apparent you understand I am concerned
with the problem of TV violence. What you are asking is how do
I approach this kind of problem in the first amendment area. That
is a fair question. And the way I approach it is that I think at the
core of the first amendment are what I have described as a kind
of cluster of things.

  There is political speech. There is also at that core the need to
communicate and talk to each other and have conversations where
we listen, like around the dinner table, which I described yester-
day, which is critical to intelligent discussion and democracy, and
there are concerns of expression, expressing--expressing a person-
ality, expressing through art, or through science. There are all
those things at the core.

  Then you move out from the core. That core is very important
and virtually inviolable. As you move out from the core, what you
discover in different directions is that sometimes we are concerned
with something that seems almost like conduct, and the closer it
is to conduct, well, the further it is from the core.

  We are concerned with instances where a particular kind of
speech might have an immediate harmful impact to society that is
tangible and real. That is your example--fire in a crowded thea-
ter--or, you cannot solicit a person to commit a crime although you
do so in words. Then you discover there are areas where in fact we
are talking about the impact on younger people. Imagine the con-
trol that society exercises in a grammar school or in a high school.

  And then, in another direction yet, you run into instances where
the expressive value is totally gone; it is not really communication
at all, though it in fact has a negative societal impact. I talked
about child pornography.

  So as you move out from that core, you look at how far away,
you look at whether there are simply rules of procedure--time,
manner and circumstance. A town meeting can be run by that. But
if you are beyond that, you look to society's needs, and you look as
well to the spillover problem, that is to say, have you got a statute
that is really narrowly tailored to those needs and will not intrude
into the core, or there is a risk that you will chill what is closer
to the core.

  Those are a few of the things, and the metaphor in my mind is
a kind of core of several different things, and the further away you
get in a number of different directions, the more you pay attention
to society's demands to come in and impose rules and regulations.

  Senator KOHL. TO what extent would it make a difference if the
evidence demonstrated that TV violence caused specific and long-
term harm to children? Would that make a difference in your con-
cern?
                                                247

  Judge BREYER. Certainly, as I said, I do not like to discuss it in
the context--I am nervous about discussing it in that particular
context, for the very reason that it is possibly the subject of litiga-
tion; it is possibly the subject of the statute, and my goodness, if
I am confirmed, that would come right before us.

  But I think as a general matter, your point is a fair point, that
the more serious real, tangible harm, the further from the core, the

  Senator KOHL. Are you imagining--and this is just an imagina-
tion, I recognize that--but is it conceivable to you, Judge Breyer,
that restrictions on media violence could ever pass constitutional
muster?

  Judge BREYER. That, I think I must stay away from, because I
imagine that should legislation pass, one of the arguments that will
be made will be the negative of that, and the other side will argue
the affirmative of that; and it seems to me very, very important
that one approach that concrete problem, if I am on the Supreme
Court, with a very, very open mind.

  Senator KOHL. OK; and finally in this area, Judge Breyer, does
government's ability to protect children from explicit material vary
according to the medium, whether print, movie, video game, or in-
formation highway, in which it is presented?

  Judge BREYER. Media, different media, have in the case law
sometimes been treated differently. But I know also there are argu-
ments in particular contexts that they should not be. So it is hard
for me to answer that, other than in that unsatisfactory general
way.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Breyer, yesterday you said that
televising Supreme Court oral arguments might be a good idea. I
have been a supporter of more radio and TV coverage in the Fed-
eral courts. I believe that if we had C-SPAN, a channel for the Su-
preme Court, that it would help Americans better appreciate their
legal system.

  So, Judge Breyer, on this area, did you watch any of the O.J.
Simpson hearing on TV, and if you did, what are your thoughts on
whether televising a hearing of this sort will have a negative effect
on the defendant's right to an impartial jury?

  Judge BREYER. Let me not talk about the particular case, and let
me think about things that were in my mind a year ago or 2 years
ago, well before that particular matter arose.

  At that time, I voted in favor in the Judicial Conference of ex-
perimenting with television in the courtroom. That has been car-
ried out. The results are being evaluated. In Massachusetts, tele-
vision is in the courtroom. The Massachusetts judges I have spoken
to seem generally satisfied. The results of that are being evaluated
in the Federal system.

  My particular appeals court was not part of the experiment, but
not for want of willingness; it was because they could only have a
small number. That is the circumstance in which I think my vote
in favor of the experiment is right as of this moment, abstracting
from this particular case and putting myself back in the frame of
mind I was 2 or 3 months ago in respect to this.

  That is basically my view. It has not changed.

  Senator KOHL. And I appreciate that comment. But are you say-
ing you do not want to answer the question on televising a hear-
ing--do you think that televising a hearing might conceivably have
a negative impact on a defendant's right to a fair jury trial?

  Judge BREYER. The question, of course, that you are raising
there, which is an important question, is the publicity and the pub-
licity on the difficulty of selecting jurors.

  Senator KOHL. That is correct.
  Judge BREYER. That is a problem, and how that is balanced is
not something I have looked into. That is not something I have
looked into. It is something that I have read enough and heard
enough about to know it is a problem. And that is where you start
from, and that is where I start from, too. You are worried about
the fairness of the trial. You are worried about the maintenance of
a free press. And somehow, the balancing of those things is terribly
important--and is not necessarily just for judges.
  Senator KOHL. OK; finally, I would like to get back to antitrust
for a minute, Judge Breyer. Senator Metzenbaum covered some of
the antitrust matters with you, and your answers were very good,
but I do have a few followups and some general questions to ask.
  Recently, we celebrated the centennial of the Sherman Act. For
over 100 years, this landmark measure has protected the principles
that we hold most dear--competition, fairness, and equality. I be-
lieve that the people who wrote the Sherman Act were driven by
a variety of beliefs. They wanted to encourage economic efficiency.
They wanted to help the little guy, the small businessman, by pre-
venting large concentrations of corporate power. And ultimately,
they wanted to help consumers.
  The antitrust laws are important because they ensure that com-
petition among businesses of any size will be fair and that consum-
ers will pay lower prices for their goods. And these laws are non-
partisan; they have been vigorously enforced by both Republican
and Democratic Presidents.
  Judge Breyer, I am concerned that some judges would disregard
the legislative intent of the antitrust laws and substitute their own
ideological agenda. Let me read you two statements about the
Sherman Act. The first is by Judge Posner of my own seventh cir-
cuit, and I quote:

  If the legislature enacts into statutory law a common law concept as Congress did
in the Sherman Act, that is a clue that the courts are to interpret the statute with
the freedom with which they interpret a common law principle, in which event the
values of the Framers may not be controlling at all.

  The second quote is by Justice Souter, speaking before this com-
mittee:

  When we are dealing with antitrust laws, we are dealing with one of the most
spectacular examples of delegation to the judiciary that our legal system knows.
Certainly, a respect for legislative intent has got to be our anchor for interpretation.

  Judge Breyer, which statement reflects the better view in your
opinion? Should the courts ever interpret the Sherman and the
Clayton Acts without exploring the legislative intent of its authors?

  Judge BREYER. I discussed that, actually, in a debate that I had
with Judge Bork where we took opposite sides to a degree on that
question, and I think I publicly there side with the second view.
                                      249

  Senator KOHL. OK; I would like to talk for a minute about price-
fixing because it is of particular concern to me. Since the Dr. Miles
case in 1911, we have had in this country a rule that prohibits
manufacturers from setting the retail price of their products by
independent retailers. But some people have begun to argue that
we should treat vertical price-fixing differently from horizontal
price-fixing.

  As Robert Bork wrote in "The Antitrust Paradox," it should be
completely lawful for a manufacturer to fix retail prices. Do you
agree with this sentiment?

  Judge BREYER. I can say the debate was quite interesting. This
was in the same debate. And basically, Judge Bork--in my recollec-
tion of the debate, we were talking about the Robinson-Patman
Act, and he was arguing about that, and in that context I think I
made fairly clear that if Congress had the intent of doing some-
thing that one might think was not necessarily according to price
theory principles, well, then, it did, and it is our job to carry it out.

  In that same debate, we discussed retail price maintenance, and
it was my own view, that I believe I expressed fairly clearly, that
the laws against resale price maintenance were good, sound anti-
trust law. I think the example that I used was that years and years
ago when I was a student, there were economist professors--some-
body, I think, at the University of London, a Professor Yamey, had
written a book and had said here are the pros, and here are the
cons; what it boils down to is laws against retail price maintenance
help the consumer. They bring about lower prices.

  And what I asked Judge Bork is what has changed; what has
changed. Now, I understand people have different views on that
issue, but I think I have expressed my own fairly clearly, quite
some time ago.

  Senator KOHL. I thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Pressler.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LARRY PRESSLER, A U.S.
         SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA

  Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, I am particularly happy to welcome you here. Hav-
ing once been your student in law school, I take particular delight
in seeing you.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator PRESSLER. And I very much appreciated your remarks
during yesterday's hearing when you said that when you deal with
cases, you listen to the party, and then try to repeat back the argu-
ment in your own words to the other side. I frequently do that in
dealing with constituents--repeat back their position. I think it is
a wonderful way to proceed.
  We have in my State of South Dakota and throughout America,
a subject that has not been brought up yet here today in this hear-
ing. Many other subjects have been covered, but I do not believe
we have talked about fee-owned land in Indian country.
  I know that Indian jurisdictional questions are very complex, and
a lot of these matters come to the Supreme Court; in fact, someone
                                               250

told me that there are more cases involving Indian tribes, jurisdic-
tion, and water rights than any other subject category that comes
to the Supreme Court.

  Putting it in layman's language, as you said, you put yourself in
each person's shoes. I recently was at the Standing Rock Indian
Reservation and the Cheyenne Indian Reservation in South Da-
kota. You can talk to a white rancher, and he will tell you that his
grandfather bought this land after the U.S. Government advertised
it, and he bought it from the U.S. Government, and maybe it has
been resold since, but the chain of title traces back, and it is very
legal and logical. You can talk to the Indian citizen, and he will say
that his great-grandfather was given this land by the U.S. Govern-
ment, and he feels that it has been illegally taken, and he seeks
compensation.

  In fact, I have tried to settle a lot of this, or I thought I was mak-
ing a contribution, back when I was in the House of Representa-
tives in the mid-1970's, and I was quoted by the Supreme Court--
only in a footnote--because I had sponsored legislation to open up
the question to waive res judicata. And in 1980, the Court made
a ruling in U.S. v. Sioux Nation of Indians, in which it gave a sub-
stantial amount of compensation to the Sioux Nation, which they
have not accepted because they do not feel it is adequate.

  But in any event, I have a long question here about fee-owned
land in Indian country where the white ranchers or the white busi-
nessmen who have been there are essentially regulated by the laws
of the reservation, and they are sometimes taxed by the reserva-
tion, and they feel that this is a violation of what they had agreed
to or what the agreement is, and they come to me with that prob-
lem. If you put yourself in both shoes, you can find many legal ar-
guments and many emotional feelings depending upon whose shoes
you are in.

  I know at Harvard Law School there have been a number of pro-
fessors--I think a couple right now are helping one of the tribes
out there with a water rights case where they are seeking hunting
and fishing rights, but in addition to that they are also seeking
payment for hydropower. And it is not just in South Dakota; in
California, for example, the Indian tribes have asserted a claim on
25 percent of all the hydropower that has been generated, and back
payments. These types of issues are coming into the courts.

  May I ask you, first of all, what is your perception of all of this?
Have you worked on some of these cases? Have you a perception
of this issue?

  Judge BREYER. Let me divide it into two parts--more basic and
more recent. The more basic, which I have mentioned--and I hope
you would be the expert on this--is that I do remember, of course,
when you were a student, and I do not know if you remember in
the course that Charlie Nessen and I developed, we spent about 20
percent of that course tracing the history of the Cherokee Indians
in Georgia. And as you may remember, the Indians in the 1930's
and 1940's were given by treaty--they were given by treaty--a sec-
tion of that State, and when gold was discovered, the Georgians ba-
sically ignored them and said goodbye. And the Indians did an un-
usual thing--they hired a lawyer who was called William Wirt,
something like that, I think. And they said we will bring a law
                                      251

case; the treaty protects us. And they went to the Supreme Court,
and they were first thrown out on what I would think of as a tech-
nicality. And then somebody from Massachusetts went down and
was put in jail and forced the issue to be raised. They went back
to the Supreme Court in a case called Wister v. Georgia, and the
Supreme Court said Indian tribe is right; they are right under the
law. And though it may be apocryphal, I think that was the case
in which Andrew Jackson said, well, John Marshall has made his
law; now let him enforce it. And it really was not enforced. And
that I call former, not recent, because I think luckily, recent law
is that the Indian tribes and others can go into the court, and the
courts respect their claims, and the Government enforces them.

  Now, what I have seen in this area, which is only a peripheral
connection, is that a number of different difficult issues tend to
arise. Sometimes, there is a treaty. Of course, Congress has the
legal authority to abrogate a treaty, like any treaty. But sometimes
there are cases because the Indian tribe says we had a treaty, and
Congress did not really abrogate it. And then you have a difficult
question, looking into the history about what Congress intended,
but basically, the rule is that the Indians have their treaty, and
where that treaty is there, the courts will assume that it is not ab-
rogated unless they are very strongly convinced to the contrary.

  Then, another kind of case arises which you begin to talk about,
which is terribly difficult, and that, of course, is a case where there
was tribal land, and then some of that land has passed through a
history and story of different connections into people who are not
members of the tribe. And then the issue is what land of authority
does the tribe exert. And it is particularly difficult where that could
include, say, some kind of criminal prosecution, where then the
person who was not a member of the tribe would say: What about
my basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution?

  Those are the kinds of issues that arise, and on the one hand,
you have to respect very much the sovereignty of the tribe; and on
the other hand, you have to recognize the claim to say basic rights
of protection. And I am very glad to hear you say that indeed, you
often look to other ways than solely court ways of resolving these
things, because I do think, for example, that sometimes, say, the
tribal authorities and the other authorities might decide to have
tribal powers that are the same in terms of protection as other
powers. If that is so, that would be a matter worked out through
Congress or worked out through your good offices, or worked out
through meetings; it would not necessarily be worked out in the
courts.

  Senator PRESSLER. One issue that will probably wind its way to
the Supreme Court in future years involves fee-owned land in In-
dian country. I will just state this question because I think it sum-
marizes much of the conflict.

  Under the General Allotment Act of 1987, known as the Dawes
Act, Congress began to allot to individual Indians tracts of land on
the reservations. Title to the land was to be held in trust for 25
years, after which the land would be conveyed to the Indian allot-
tee by means of a patent. Originally, Indian individuals had to
apply for these allotments, but later the law was changed to allow
the Secretary of the Interior to issue fee patents to Indians regard-
                                               252

less of whether they had applied for an allotment. These were
known as forced fee patents.

  Over the years, many of these Indian allotments were then sold
to non-Indians, advertised by the Federal Government in some
cases; maybe they were trying to raise revenue--I do not know--
but they sold them to white settlers.

  Furthermore, various acts of Congress, such as the Cheyenne
River Act of 1908, opened the reservations to non-Indian settlers,
which actually was a reversal of what Congress had originally
done.

  We now have the situation where there are many acres of non-
Indian fee-owned land lying within the borders of the Indian res-
ervations. This has created a checkerboard ownership pattern with
non-Indians owning some land, Indians owning other parcels, and
other land held in trust by the Federal Government for the tribes.
This situation has prompted many court cases, which often must
resolve the question of whether the State or the tribe has jurisdic-
tion over non-Indians or non-Indian lands.

  Now, some tribes assert a complete right to regulate the lives of
all people living within the boundaries of their reservation, even
when the reservation encompasses all this checkerboard land and
regardless of whether they are Indian or non-Indian.

  Last year, the Supreme Court decided in South Dakota v.
Bourland that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe could not regulate
the hunting and fishing rights of non-Indians on Federal lands pre-
viously owned by the tribe. And I think some of your colleagues at
Harvard Law School were on one side of that brief; I cannot re-
member for sure.

  Now, Indian tribes do not allow non-Indians to participate in
their elections, to serve in tribal office, or to serve on tribal juries.
So you have this situation of non-Indians living and owning prop-
erty within a reservation subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal
courts and the tribal police and so forth, but they cannot vote in
the tribal elections. So they come to me, and they will come to you
in the courts, seeking some kind of relief.

  Nonetheless, tribes in my State have imposed licensing fees on
liquor stores owned by non-Indians on fee-owned land located with-
in the boundaries of the Indian reservation.

  Well, anyway, that is the complete bundle of the problem, and
I have struggled with this as a Congressman and as a Senator from
South Dakota over the years, and later, I am going to ask you
about one piece of legislation that we have tried, but I guess my
question--if I have one, because you could answer so many dif-
ferent aspects of it--is given the fact that non-Indians have no
right to participate in tribal governments, do you see any constitu-
tional problem when a tribe taxes a business owned by a non-In-
dian located on fee-owned land but within the boundaries of the
reservation? Or, stated another way, is it constitutional for tribes
to tax and regulate those who have no ability to influence how
their taxes will be acquired and spent?

  Judge BREYER. I think that is an aspect of the broader problem
that you state. And I think that could well be a matter in litiga-
tion, and it is not a matter that I am really expert on. It seems
to me the most difficult part of what you say is where, on the one
                                               253

hand, the tribe has sovereignty, and that sovereignty must be re-
spected.

  On the other hand, those people who now perhaps unwillingly
are subject to the tribe sovereignty feel they lack a basic right that
they would have, if that sovereignty were not there. And there it
sounds to me as if what you are trying to do is to encourage people
to get together to the point where, at least from the point of view
of the person who is there, he gets the rights either way. Of course,
that is the best situation.

  If whether the Indian tribe has the sovereignty or whether the
State has the sovereignty, that person is basically just as well off.
I don't know if you can bring that about. That is really a political
matter and a matter of negotiating and learning and meetings of
all kinds that aren't necessarily judicial meetings. I understand
that that is what you try to do, and I can just say, from the point
of view of the judicial aspect of the problem, it sounds very dif-
ficult, with important interests on both sides.

  Senator PRESSLER. NOW, the Indian tribes have found a great
source of revenue in gambling, and reservation gambling is pro-
vided for by the U.S. Congress. Several States have tried to find
a way to tax or get a portion of gaming proceeds, and several tribes
have gotten very wealthy. There is a sort of irony in all of this. In-
deed, some of the smaller tribes on the east coast have become very
wealthy.

  The point is that the States in which these gambling casinos are
located cannot tax tribal gaming proceeds. Do you have any feeling
about that subject?

  Judge BREYER. I know that is the subject of a congressional stat-
ute, and I know the statute tries to create a situation where certain
defined tribes--and there is a definition, and I know there are
sometimes arguments about where tribes and which tribes and
under what circumstances tribes--but where you pass that prob-
lem, I think the statute requires a negotiation, and then the nego-
tiation between the State and the tribe over the details of the gam-
bling that the statute permits is designed to work that out in part.
That is my guess and understanding.

  I also understand that issues can arise about whether or not ne-
gotiation is in good faith, the extent to which the court gets in-
volved in supervising the negotiation. In other words, I see the is-
sues and I understand the importance of it, and I am not certain
legally really how they actually work out. That would depend upon
a particular case.

  Senator PRESSLER. In Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, a 1979
U.S. Supreme Court case, the Court held that suits against a tribe
for violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act may not be brought in
Federal court, that is they have to be brought in the tribal courts.
As a result, individual tribal members, although citizens of the
United States, are limited to relief, if any, in their respective tribal
court system. Many tribal governments do not provide for a court
system independent of the executive, creating the possibility of in-
timidation by the executive leadership.

  Several years ago, I cosponsored legislation, which was not suc-
cessful, with my friend Senator Hatch, who is not here now, and
others, I believe in the early 1980's, which would have permitted
                                         254

individuals who had exhausted their remedies in tribal courts for
violations of the Indian Civil Rights Act to bring an action in Fed-
eral court. Now, that measure did not become law, so today people
exhaust their rights under the Indian Civil Rights Act in tribal
courts.

  Now, do you believe the Federal courts should be immediately
open to anyone who alleges an Indian tribe has deprived him or
her of a Federal constitutional right? And should Native Americans
be entitled to the same constitutional protection afforded to all
Americans in our Federal courts? On this question of jurisdiction,
may an Indian tribe require non-Indians living on a reservation to
exhaust their remedies in the tribal court system, before appealing
in Federal court, even though non-Indians do not enjoy the con-
stitutional protection in tribal courts? Wouldn't such a requirement
deprive non-Indians of their due process rights?

  To throw all those questions together, should litigants in Indian
Country be able to appeal to the Federal district court at the end
of their journey through the tribal courts? There is a case I think
that will come up to the Supreme Court again on that, or it will
try to come up. Do you have any feeling on that?

  Judge BREYER. Well, my substantive instinct is, of course, that
if the procedures and protections in the tribal court can be brought
to match those in the Federal court, the problem will tend to go
away, because then, of course, you would have the same protection
in both places. And that is not a judicial question. That is a ques-
tion of people meeting and understanding and talking to each other
and trying to work out appropriate procedures.

  When you turn to the legal question, which is premised on that
not having been done, as you point out, that might come up to the
Supreme Court, and I am on that Court, I would have to decide
that question and, therefore, I couldn't really express as view about
it.

  I think that your instinct that if it comes out the way that you
think is not appropriate, the solution would be legislative. I think
that is a correct instinct.

  Senator PRESSLER. That concludes my questions on Indian juris-
diction. But as I read your statement again, your statement yester-
day, saying that you try to repeat the argument back in your own
words to the other side, I thought that was very much what we
have to do with the Indian/white problems, to work for reconcili-
ation. And, indeed, as you do change shoes, you can find arguments
just about as strong on each side, and you will have to deal with
a lot of those.

  Back in that class you taught me a long time ago, your mention-
ing Andrew Jackson and the Cherokee Indians march to Oklahoma
leads me to this question. When was the last time the President
of the United States refused to back up the Supreme Court in a
matter that the Supreme Court ordered? I mean our whole con-
stitutional system could have broken down.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator PRESSLER. The second part of the question is do you feel
that the executive and legislative branches back up the court sys-
tem today? I mean that is almost unheard of. Our whole system
                                               255

would not work, if we did what Andrew Jackson did in that in-
stance, is that not correct?

  Judge BREYER. Absolutely; that is why I said in response to Sen-
ator Kohl that I thought Cooper v. Aaron was such an important
decision, because it is the absolute verification of what you said,
that the executive and legislative branches would stand behind the
decisions of the Federal courts.

  Senator PRESSLER. I think one of the concerns that some of us
have in the antitrust area and the deregulation area can be sum-
marized this way: In inner cities and in small cities and rural
areas, a lot of big companies don't want to provide service. They
would rather provide it in the wealthy suburbs. For example, tele-
communications is something I work on a great deal, and we find
that the new information highway is going to be abundantly avail-
able in wealthy suburbs and larger cities, but not necessarily in
inner cities or in small cities or rural areas. The same is true of
air service. The same is true of railroad service.

  I know you have done a lot of work on deregulation. But I have
found myself representing a small city rural State constantly strug-
gling to preserve air service or train service or trucking services,
or indeed long-distance telephone rates that are reasonable.

  Now we are on the verge of fiber optics cable and broad-band and
providing computerized information in the home. If somebody is not
on this informational superhighway by the time they are 15, they
are never going to be on it, if they are not into putting information
into the computer and getting information back out.

  You will be making a lot of rulings on antitrust and responsibil-
ities of companies. Of course, we do not have the 1934 act any more
that said if you take some rich routes, you have to take some poor
routes, and so forth. But, in general, how do you see the Humboldt,
South Dakotas, and indeed every State, upstate New York and
Massachusetts, smaller cities and towns, not so much on the east
coast, because you have so many people, but, indeed, parts of Cali-
fornia--Fresno and those small towns that stretch from there to
Bakersfield--getting serviced by companies not eager to provide as
much air service or as much fiber optic cable or all the miraculous
developments in telecommunications.

  My basic concern is your philosophy of deregulation is going to
leave a lot of people out of the superhighway of information and
knowledge and all the good things that are coming. What are your
thoughts on that?

  Judge BREYER. I think you are addressing really my thoughts as
a matter of policy, rather than my thoughts as a judge. Of course,
as a judge, one tries to follow the law as it is written.

  When I was involved in airline deregulation, this problem arose.
It is true that the general thrust of airline deregulation was that
prices would go down for the vast majority of Americans. At the
same time, I believe when that statute that was written, your point
was a valid point, that in terms of infrastructure, it is important
that the entire Nation be seen as a single nation and people not
be left out.

  Therefore, written into that statute was a subsidy that Congress
at the time believed would be adequate to maintain service at
smaller rural airports, the idea being that no rural community cur-
                                      256
rently at that time having scheduled service would lose all its serv-
ice. There would be some lifeline there.

  Now, whether that subsidy was adequate, whether it worked out
in practice, that is a matter for history and possibly criticism. But
the intent of the movement was not totally to sacrifice the needs
of those who are not in the populous communities. It was to recog-
nize those needs and to try to provide for them, especially so that
there would be interconnections everywhere. That is basically the
principle, though one could criticize from that point of view the exe-
cution.

  Senator PRESSLER. Let me ask a question on the exclusionary
rule. I know you covered this to some extent. There was a crime
bill written here in the Senate that would have made more evi-
dence admissible to the jury. One perhaps good thing coming out
of the O.J. Simpson publicity is that a lot more people across the
country are thinking about the exclusionary rule, and I think it is
going to become an issue in future political debates, and maybe
that's where it should be.

  If legislatures were to pass a law saying that more evidence that
police pick up at the scene of a crime without a search warrant can
be given to the jury or the fruits of the search can be given to the
judge or the jury, it is said this would be found unconstitutional,
because the fourth amendment provides quite a bit of protection.

  Yet, our citizens are getting angry at hearing stories, when you
do have a search warrant and you find something else or the fruits
of the search are not related to the search warrant, then it is
thrown out, it cannot be brought before the jury. Or if policemen
upon the scene of a crime go into other rooms or pick up evidence,
the argument is it should not be admitted, because the policemen
could have gotten a telephonic search warrant or something like
that.

  In other words, a lot of evidence never gets to the jury or the
judge, in the feeling of the public, and I think this is going to be
a very big issue in future campaigns in this country. I think we are
going to focus on the exclusionary rule. But it is said that even if
a statute enacted by Congress broadening what the police can pick
up and present, it would be declared unconstitutional. What is your
view of that?

  Judge BREYER. My guess is it would depend upon the statute.
You have to look into the detail.

  Senator PRESSLER. DO you have any feelings about what the ex-
clusionary rule should be? Do you think it is about where it should
be, or do you think it is too restrictive?

  Judge BREYER. I cannot say as a matter of policy, because that
is so much a judgment for others. That is, the basic idea, of course,
is that it is very puzzling to people, very puzzling, what Cardozo
said. He said, "Well, why should the criminal go free, because the
constable has blundered?" And the answer to that is, over the
course of time and a long period of time, people learned that the
protection in the fourth amendment, totally innocent people
wouldn't be broken into in the middle of the night, that confessions
wouldn't be extracted through violence, that the only way to make
those meaningful in practice was to have this exclusionary rule.
And it has become I think fairly widely accepted.
                                             257

  The exact contours of it and the shape and size and on the bor-
der how it should look, and so forth, I recognize, but that is a mat-
ter of considerable controversy and debate, and Congress or others
might well criticize or want to do it this way or that way or the
other way.

  Senator PRESSLER. On the issue of habeas corpus, the average
citizen looking at this system sees appeal after appeal sometimes.
Would you be satisfied with one thorough appeal that a judge took
a look at and said that was a thorough complete appeal? Would
that be satisfactory to you?

  Judge BREYER. When you say satisfactory to me, the great de-
bate, as you recognize in this area, particularly with the death pen-
alty, is involved, is habeas corpus tells us we don't want to have
this or any person have a penalty particularly of this sort, if the
trial was fundamentally unfair. Of course, people keep coming on
again and again and they say, well, it was fundamentally unfair,
and then the courts say no, it was OK, and then they have a new
reason and a new reason, and so the problem is this problem of
delay.

  At the same time, people might sometimes come up with reasons
that they for good cause couldn't present before. So I understand
how you are trying to balance those two things, the need for fun-
damental fairness and the need to avoid unreasonable delay. How
it works out in the statute again is going to be up to Congress. My
guess is you will get one final procedure and some cases will come
along where something was discovered later, and you will say, well,
the procedure couldn't have taken that into account. So I think you
will improve the situation. I am sure there are all kinds of ways
of improving it. This is such a fundamental tension, that I doubt
it will ever be perfectly solved.

   Senator PRESSLER. My final question involves tort reform. Again
we hear much argument. We are told that our revolutions in this
country have been in the courtroom and not in the streets with
guns. Through suing, a small person or a poor person can get at
a large corporation that has wronged them. On the other hand, we
have so many lawsuits, we are told that the cost of our products
has risen substantially.

  If you could implement tort reform for the United States tomor-
row, what would you do?

  Judge BREYER. I am glad sometimes that I am not in the Con-
gress of the United States, and this is not a matter on which I am
expert and I am really very pleased to leave that for you to decide.

   Senator PRESSLER. It may well be that the Supreme Court will
have to decide some of it, especially on punitive damages and is-
sues of that kind. You are not going to give us any glimpse of

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you want to go back to being chief counsel of
the committee? [Laughter.]

  Judge BREYER. It was a wonderful job.
   Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much, and congratulations.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I might point out for the record what my
recollection is, and this is not correcting you or anyone else, that,
on habeas corpus, in 40 percent or thereabouts of the petitions filed
                                               258

in capital cases, the courts feel they have merit, so they are not all
frivolous.

  At any rate, there is a vote on, Judge. We have about I guess
7 minutes in which to vote. Rather than take the break after the
next questioner, who will be Senator Feinstein, why don't we break
now for 10 minutes and then resume about 10 minutes of.

  Judge BREYER. Perfect.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  We will recess to vote.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, welcome back.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have not had a chance to speak with your peo-
ple about this, but we can speak about this scheduling in the open
here.
  One of the things is that I do not think we are going to be able
to finish tonight. I do not think there are a lot more questions, but
most members have several more questions. It would push us well
into the late evening, and then I am not sure we could finish.
  So what I would propose--and this is tentative until I have a
chance to check with Senator Hatch, but I think this will be agree-
able to him--is we will go until about 6 p.m. tonight, which means
that Senators Feinstein and Moseley-Braun will ask their first
round. I will ask a second round, probably not a full round but a
second round of questions. Senator Hatch may or may not wish to
go tonight and ask a second round, in which case we will start to-
morrow with what, as I indicated earlier, is a pro forma closed ses-
sion. There are probably going to be a series of votes stacked
around 11:30 tomorrow, by which time we will probably be finished
with the closed session anyway. We will do the votes and convene
the open hearing again tomorrow at 1 o'clock. I fully expect we will
be able to finish in early evening, late afternoon, with your testi-
mony.
  Based on the witness list and the way things appear to be
going--and you and I have been doing this long enough, and you
are familiar enough with this to know, no one ever knows anything
for certain--but I expect we would have no problem going through
the entire witness list, giving the witnesses their full opportunity
to make their cases on Friday, and the hearing would close down
at a reasonable hour on Friday.
  It would be my intention, with the cooperation of my colleagues,
to have an executive session early in the week. As my grandfather
Finnegan used to say, "with the grace of God and the good will of
the neighbors," by the end of next week the nomination, if all con-
tinues as it is, would be on the floor.
  If that is generally agreeable with you, that would be my judg-
ment as to the most orderly way in which to proceed. But I will
discuss that in more detail with my colleagues, and in the mean-
time, I will yield to my distinguished colleague from California,
whose patience is exceeded only by her equally distinguished col-
league from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, who have both been
waiting patiently here.
  I yield the floor now to Senator Feinstein.
                                      259

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are known as
what is the caboose on this train. We kind of bring up the rear.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you know those trolley cars where the en-
gine is sometimes in the back and sometimes in the front. I think
the committee has learned that you may be the caboose, but you
are the engine.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. That is very generous of you. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is also true. When you decide something is im-
portant--I remember saying to you, no, we cannot possibly pass the
assault weapons ban. If you can talk Henry Hyde into it, good luck.
And, Lord, if you did not go over and talk Henry Hyde into it. So
you are an engine, Senator.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. That
is very nice.
  The CHAIRMAN. Theflooris yours.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Breyer, I just want to make a comment on the proceedings
so far. I really want to compliment you. First of all, I believe wholly
in your credibility and your integrity. But what came through
today I think to me was your ability as a teacher, because you did
what so many people, particularly around here, do not do. You re-
duce things to their basic, elemental, simple truth. And when you
talked about the coal columns as an example of appropriate regula-
tion, I think you showed all America exactly what it is.
  Many times I have found things get so mired down in cases here,
and no one really knows what we are talking about. So I really ap-
preciate this, and I think you have made a lot of things clear. I
think you have done extraordinarily well, and I just wanted to say
that before I begin.
  I notice, too, that there has not even been a yawn from your fam-
ily. So on all scores, it is doing well.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you very much.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. I want to talk to you about two things, and
hopefully talk to you rather than really question you. The first is
individual versus societal rights under the Constitution.
  Let me begin by reading a quick statement from someone I have
admired from what is called the other House here. His name is
Sam Ervin, and he said this in 1973.

  The twin evils of criminal and political violence stand as a threat to our liberty
in two ways. Liberty cannot survive an anarchy, but neither can it survive if our
Nation's leaders and people come to feel that the only path to security lies in sus-
pending constitutional freedoms for the duration.

  And, in a sense, that is the delicate balance with which I would
think a jurist must grapple. What are the rights of the few when
they come in conflict with the rights of the many?

  In a sense, today I want to talk to you about the rights of the
few versus the rights of the many.

  Last week, in California, I spent a lot of time in the commu-
nities, and I have in other cities as well. And I think violence in
this Nation has reached such a state of epidemic proportions and
concern for everybody. Regardless of race, creed, color, social or eco-
nomic status, people are looking over their shoulder, regardless of
whether they live in the suburbs or the big cities.
                                             260

  One school, I will give you an example, fourth-grade class, Holly-
wood, CA, had written to me because of their fear of violence. So
I went to the school, and I talked to a fourth-grade class, I guess
about 40 youngsters. In the course of the conversation, I asked the
question: How many of you hear gunshots at night? And how many
of you wake up to them in the morning? Every hand in the class
went up.

  I asked the question: How many of you have seen people getting
beaten up? And 70 percent of the class, their hands went up. How
many of you are afraid to go to school? About the same number of
the class went up.

  Now, you could ask any class that in your hometown and my
hometown. One of our newspapers just did a study. Twenty-two
percent of the youngsters admit to bringing guns to schools. Big
problem in our society.

  My question is this: I know that the Bill of Rights of our Con-
stitution was designed to protect Americans against the enormous
powers of the Government, also provided by the Constitution, in ef-
fect to protect the few from the many. And this is, I think, true in
special circumstances: free speech, the free exercise of religion, pro-
tection from discrimination, regulation. But it is clear to me that
in matters of public safety and perhaps other fundamental areas,
we really need to protect the fabric of our society for the majority
from the few among us who have the power to destroy it.

  I read an article in the paper of one Governor imposing a curfew,
again, to protect the rights of the many. Also, I suppose, it limits
the rights of the few.

  If you could talk just as a teacher, as a scholar, for a few mo-
ments before I got into something direct, about where you see this
coming down, how you would see this as a jurist?

  Judge BREYER. I do not have special insight. As a human being,
when I hear that one real child is killed every hour through vio-
lence, of course, I react like every human being reacts to that in
this country. I mean, absolutely intolerable.

  Then when you say as a jurist, I think of the Preamble to the
Constitution, as a jurist. Why the Preamble? Well, because it has
always seemed to me that the Preamble has stated there what the
goals are, simply, so any person can understand it. And the rest
of the Constitution is a few understandable instructions for reach-
ing those goals.

  And I see right in that Preamble, it says,

  Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare, and assure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity.

  It says both assure domestic tranquility and provide the bless-
ings of liberty.

  Then the rest of the Constitution, being a set of instructions to
reach those goals, must be interpreted in a way so that both can
be reached. And then you pose the terribly difficult question: How
do you choose among them?

  I have no magic answer to that question. Sometimes I have done
the following in a case where, in fact, say there is a question of the
fourth amendment interpretation and the right not to be seized il-
                                      261

legally, the right not to be searched illegally, and what does that
amount to, and is it this or is it that?

  Sometimes I go back and try in my own mind to remember that
those rights are there to protect innocent people. And we protect
guilty people because that is absolutely necessary if we are going
to protect innocent people.

  And so I ask myself: What would an innocent person think about
what is going on? The case that came up, you see, was a case about
whether a policeman could say to a person at the airport, who was
acting very suspiciously: Excuse me, do you mind if I ask a few
questions? And the man said yes.

  Now, did that violate the fourth amendment? Though the ques-
tion was a close one, I thought no. And my reason for thinking no
was because I thought most innocent people do not mind answering
questions when posed by the police where they are not put in cus-
tody, where they are not subject to restraint, but they are politely
asked, Do you mind answering a question?

  So that notion of what do innocent people actually fear is an un-
reasonable restraint on their liberty, I have found sometimes helps
reconcile those two things in the context of a real case. I do not
know if that is helpful. I see the need to pursue both.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me give you an example. Some of us, I
think, on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that will be
coming up, will put an amendment or try to place an amendment
that will say that any school that accepts Federal money must have
a zero tolerance for guns in schools; that if a youngster brings a
gun to school, that youngster is expelled for 1 year. Otherwise, I
go home, and all people are talking about are metal detectors in
schools. Metal detectors should not have to be in schools.

  Judge BREYER. I agree with you.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. And I think we reach that point where we
really need to protect the general welfare.
  Now, let me go to where it gets tricky. The second amendment,

  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right
of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

  Arms is in a capital, State begins with a capital, and Militia be-
gins with a capital.

  I think it is probably true to say that the Framers of the Con-
stitution provided no guidance as to whether the amendment was
intended to secure the rights of individuals to own guns, to provide
exclusively for a well-regulated militia, like the National Guard, or
both.

  Proponents of gun control argue that, although challenged, re-
strictions on the sale and ownership of guns have never been
struck down by the courts on the basis of the second amendment.
Indeed, in the United States v. Miller, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected a second amendment argu-
ment in upholding California's 1989 assault weapons ban. The Na-
tional Rifle Association, which had challenged the ban, elected not
to appeal the ninth circuit's ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, not, I think, considered a
political liberal, accused the NRA of perpetrating the greatest con-
stitutional fraud in history for its repeated reference to the second
amendment as a bar to gun control legislation.
                                               262

  Now, as the chairman of the committee said, I have just au-
thored legislation on assault weapons. I have seen them become
the gun of choice of youngsters, of grievance killers, and it ap-
peared to me that the public well-being is served by not having
what is crafted as a military weapon, first and foremost, available
on the streets, homes, and workplaces of our cities and our counties
and our Nation.

  Whether that will be challenged or not, I do not know. I almost
hope it would be so that we could settle, much like the coal mine,
what is an appropriate role for government regulation.

  I cannot forget the faces of the youngsters who raised their
hands, every one in a class, that I go to sleep every night to the
sound of gunfire. And to me, it is the rights of the many to feel safe
that come into conflict with the rights of the few to possess and
bear weapons.

  I would appreciate any comment that you might care to give as
to the Miller case, as to the second amendment, and how you might
see it.

  Judge BREYER. AS you recognize, Senator, the second amendment
is in the Constitution. It provides a protection. As you also have
recognized, the Supreme Court law on the subject is very, very few
cases. This really has not been gone into in any depth by the Su-
preme Court at all.

  Like you, I have never heard anyone even argue that there is
some kind of constitutional right to have guns in a school. And I
know that every day--not every day, I do not want to exaggerate,
but every week or every month for the last 14 years, I have sat on
case after case in which Congress has legislated rules, regulations,
restrictions of all kinds on weapons; that is to say, there are many,
many circumstances in which carrying weapons of all kinds is pun-
ishable by very, very, very severe penalties. And Congress, often by
overwhelming majorities, has passed legislation imposing very se-
vere additional penalties on people who commit all kinds of crimes
with guns, even various people just possessing guns under certain
circumstances.

  In all those 14 years, I have never heard anyone seriously argue
that any of those was unconstitutional in a serious way. I should
not say never because I do not remember every case in 14 years.
So, obviously, it is fairly well conceded across the whole range of
society, whatever their views about gun control legislatively and so
forth, that there is a very, very large area for government to act.
At the same time, as you concede, and others, there is some kind
of protection given in the second amendment.

  Now, that is, it seems to me, where I have to stop, and the rea-
son that I have to stop is we are in a void in terms of what the
Supreme Court has said. There is legislation likely to pass or has
recently passed that will be challenged. And I, therefore, if I am
on that Court, have to listen with an open mind to the arguments
that are made in the particular context.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, would you hold that the 1939 decision
is good law?

  Judge BREYER. I have not heard it argued that it is not, but I
have not reviewed the case, and I do not know the argument that
would really come up. I know that it has been fairly limited, what
                                               263

the Supreme Court has said, and I know that it has been fairly
narrow. I also know that other people make an argument for a
somewhat more expanded view. But nobody that I have heard
makes the argument going into these areas where there is quite a
lot of regulation already.

  I should not really underline no one, because you can find, you
know, people who make different arguments. But it seems there is
a pretty board consensus there.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Would you attach any significance to the
Framers of the second amendment where it puts certain things in
capital letters?

  Judge BREYER. I am sure when you interpret this, you do go back
from the text to the history and try to get an idea of what they had
in mind. And if there is a capital letter there, you ask, Why is
there this capital letter there? Somebody had an idea, and you read
and try to figure out what the importance of that was viewed at
the time and if that has changed over time.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Moseley-Braun.
  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CAROL MOSELEY-BRAUN, A

           U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Feinstein is the caboose. I guess that makes me the flag.
When you are No. 18 on a panel like this, you learn a lot, Judge
Breyer, and I have certainly learned a lot listening to my col-
leagues and their questions and certainly to your very clear re-
sponses. And I have been, frankly, very much impressed by the
clarity of your thinking, the preciseness and succinctness of your
answers to the question, and they have been difficult questions.
They have ranged just about the gamut. So I am kind of bringing
up the rear here on the first round, but I did have an area that
I wanted to discuss with you a little bit today that, in my years,
certainly in law school but later in practice, that was very near and
dear to my heart and that is no doubt near and dear to yours inso-
far as you have written in the area of administrative law quite a
bit. And I, frankly, feel that these cases and these issues in admin-
istrative law are so important because, the big-picture issues not-
withstanding, the administrative process is often where the rubber
meets the road insofar as the rights of the little guy are concerned.
  Judge BREYER. I agree.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. The cases that come out of the agency
decisionmaking very often impact on real people in their day-to-day
lives in a more direct fashion than many of the other more esoteric
and philosophical issues. And so while I would like to get to the
esoteric and at some point, if I get a chance, I would like to start
by asking you about your philosophical decisions and your decision-
making in terms of administrative law.
  It is particularly true since the time of the New Deal that Fed-
eral administrative agencies have played a major role in the devel-
opment of policies that regulate the personal lives of American citi-
zens and the commercial life of this Nation. And in reviewing some
                                                264

of your cases, in fact, at least three cases which you have written--
one had to do with a death claim for asbestosis by a pipefitter in
a shipyard, and another a bead-stringer, whether or not the 17
years as a dollmaker qualified that person for employment disabil-
ity, and whether or not a highway bypass could be constructed.
And, of course, the Supreme Court recently ruled in a case involv-
ing my home, Chicago, with regard to the treatment of municipal
waste.

  And so we have got this line of cases, and the central issue really
comes down to the role of the courts in regulating the regulators,
and whether or not the judicial review of agency decisionmaking
actually forms an adequate check on the power of the agency vis-
a-vis the individual.

  The Supreme Court had acknowledged the oversight function in
Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, and as you know, that was a case
that involved a challenge by pharmaceutical companies to a regula-
tion issued by the FDA. In deciding whether or not there was au-
thority for judicial review of the agency decisionmaking, the Court
held that judicial review would be improper only upon a showing
of clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to pre-
clude judicial involvement.

  Lately, however, the Court seems to have lowered that standard,
backing away from that standard, and making it less likely that
agency decisions will be subject to judicial scrutiny. In a case de-
cided last term, Thunder Basin Coal v. Wright, the Court appeared
to replace the Abbott clear and convincing standard with a stand-
ard that would prevent judicial review of an agency action in any
case in which the intent on the part of Congress is--"fairly discern-
ible in the statutory scheme."

  While the Court in Thunder Basin attempted to distinguish itself
from the opinion in Abbott Labs, I am not quite sure that the dis-
tinction is as clear as they said it was in Thunder Basin, and I fear
that the Thunder Basin decision might signal a willingness of the
Court to remove itself from--to retrench from the review of deci-
sions of administrative agencies.

  So I would pose the question to you: Do you agree that there has
been a trend away from judicial review of administrative decision-
making, and therefore do you agree that it holds the troubling
prospect that the rights of the individual little people vis-a-vis
these agencies which have so much power over their lives, that
those rights might be less protected in the future than previously?

  Judge BREYER. I think I would say three or four things. I think
first, if there is such a trend, it is troubling. Second, the reason
that I think it is troubling is I understand all these constitutional
rights are very important--believe me, we all think they are in-
credibly important--but one thing also that is very important is
just the area that you are talking about. And the reason that I
think that to myself is because if you are dealing with whether a
man or a woman is getting a Social Security disability check, you
do not just think to yourself: That check is as important to that
man or woman as a whole business is to its owner. You think it
is more important, because that man or woman has nothing else.

  And I think, too--when I was walking about 4 months ago with
Judge Woodlock somewhere in Boston, and he pointed out a build-
                                               265

ing, and in that building, they had worked out a series of part-time
people, lawyers, who give a little bit of their time for a very low
price--I believe this is how it works--so that people who have little
complaints--little complaints--that just means a complaint that
maybe, compared to some other complaint, is little; it is not little
to the person--and they have a way of coming in and getting some
kind of proceeding to see that they have been treated fairly in re-
spect to a sidewalk, or snow removal, or a parking ticket, or what-
ever--that is terribly important.

  Why is it so important? That is really my third point. The reason
it is so important is it is important to that individual, and it is
really quite a wonderful, marvelous thing to have a society that
treats those complaints properly.

  And my fourth point is I guess when I was with these judges in
Russia which, as you can tell--I will slow down a little, because I
am feeling strongly about it

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I am glad.
  Judge BREYER. We were talking about it, and I said do not for-
get--you see, we have a meeting of the administrative law people
and the American Bar Association--we sometimes say we are ad-
ministrative law buffs--we believe it is important, too, and how
many, and so forth. Well, I said to the Russian people there: Please
do not forget this part of the law, because one wonderful thing that
happened in that part of the law was that one time, it was decided
that we would write everything down. That does not seem that im-
portant, but it is so important. It was something as a result of a
Supreme Court case where somebody could not find the regulation,
and after that, Congress said if that regulation is not written down,
if you do not have that in the Code of Federal Regulations, if there
is not a place where a person can go without a lawyer, if necessary,
to find out what he is supposed to do, then it is not a rule, and
it is not a regulation. I thought to the Russians that, too, is an
enormous protection against arbitrary behavior, against people who
are in the Government saying, "Well, this is what you have to do,
and tomorrow, we will tell you why you have to do it."
  So all of those are reasons why I agree with you, I think this is
a very important area of law.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think we share the same view, and
you have made the point very well, I think, Judge, that this really
does serve as a check and balance in the system that frankly, the
Framers of the Constitution almost did not have to think about;
but following the explosion of the administrative agencies, the far-
reaching consequences of that decisionmaking, clearly, the rights of
the individual vis-a-vis that kind of array of power can only be pro-
tected if the courts are vigilant in regulating the regulators and
providing that backdrop of protection of personal rights and indi-
vidual liberty versus the agency decisionmaking in cases in which
it may be arbitrary--which raises a second set of concerns, namely
the ability in present time of the courts to exercise that function
adequately.
  We have seen, with the explosion of litigation and with the over-
burdening of the courts--everybody reads articles about how over-
worked the courts are and how they are cutting back on activity,
and in fact, in my State of Illinois just a month ago, the Supreme
                                                266

Court promulgated a rule that limited the number of opinions that
the appellate courts could issue every year on the grounds that the
courts were overburdened and that there could only be a finite
number of opinions, a finite number of written decisions.

  Well, these two factors coming together may well mean that we
are confronted with a limitation or a retrenchment or a retraction
of the capacity of the courts to look out for the rights of that bead-
stringer or that pipe fitter or that individual who many have a
claim for medical services, and someone has decided that they can-
not have it.

  How would you address the challenge that the court overload or
the allocation of judicial resources poses for us now? How do we get
around having the courts retrench in this very important area?
Can you shed any guidance or light on how you would suggest
going forward?

  Judge BREYER. I have said a couple of things which may help a
little but not a lot. One is a positive thing, and one is a negative
thing. The positive thing is that probably, it is worth, when Con-
gress passes laws, when State legislatures pass laws, when agen-
cies have rules and regulations, a human being thinking about the
process of translating that statute, rule, law, regulation into re-
ality. And that means think through when and whether court proc-
ess, administrative process, mediation process, or some combina-
tion thereof will be the most effective way of making that right in
the statute real.

  I do not know how you would come out, but I am reasonably con-
vinced it is worth trying to give someone the job of thinking
through that problem every time some statute that affects people
is or is not going to be passed or modified.

  The negative thing is this. Beware of door-closing in the courts.
Beware of it in the following sense. Remember that the Social Se-
curity case to the person who needs the Social Security really is as
important as any other case involving a lot more money.

  No one will say that the court procedure as it is now set up is
the perfect procedure. It may be, as some have suggested, that
some cases of different kinds should go to mediation or so forth.
But if that is to happen, the people involved must be convinced
that that is a better process, and an escape route must be main-
tained so that there still remains the possibility of some access.

  Now, that has happened sometimes, like where Congress has set
up special courts like veterans' courts, so that both you have a spe-
cialty which will process the case more quickly, but an escape route
is maintained so it is possible for a person who is hurt by that
process to get back into Federal court. In other words, tailoring of
different kinds I think is possible. I am sure it is worth thinking
about, and I am sure that it cannot send a message that some peo-
ple's cases are worth less than others.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, I am just so delighted to hear
you say that, because quite frankly, in the context of, again, scarce
judicial resources, the movement toward limiting judicial oversight,
the values that you express here today really stand in danger of
being lost, and if those values are lost, then those doors will be
closed, and those individuals will not have the kind of protection
                                               267

against the power of the agencies across the board that I believe,
and I am delighted to hear that you believe, they ought to have.

  Talking about how one looks at administrative law, statutory
law, you have written in your writings regarding the use of legisla-
tive history, and there has been some discussion of this already,
but you cited different circumstances in which the history behind
a statute can help to reach the proper result. And I must say I was
delighted again that it is a very pragmatic standard; it is a stand-
ard that suggests that people look at avoiding an absurd result, for
example, and to correct an error, to take into full account any spe-
cialized meaning that the statutory word may have, to identify rea-
sonable purpose, or to choose among reasonable interpretations of
a politically controversial statute.

  That is actually also encouraging because, again, getting back to
Thunder Basin, in that case Justices Scalia and Thomas objected
to the majority reliance on legislative history as an indication of
congressional intent. Justice Scalia wrote there, and I quote: "I find
this discussion unnecessary to the decision. It serves to maintain
the illusion"--he calls it an illusion--"that legislative history is an
important factor in this Court's deciding of cases."

  Just for a moment, if you would share with us whether you be-
lieve that it is an illusion, that legislative history is an illusion, or
if in fact legislative history is something that is important, and
should be looked at by the Court.

  Judge BREYER. The answer is I do not think it is an illusion. I
think it is very important to look at. I once debated Justice Scalia
in the Hall of Justice on this point, and we debated about whose
view was the illusion. They were opposite views, and I doubt that
we convinced each other. But nonetheless I did think and do think
that legislative history is very, very important.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I agree with you there, also. I would
now like to ask you to focus in on the role that you think that real
life history, real history, should play in a court's decision, if any,
and specifically, to explore your thoughts on some of the recent Su-
preme Court cases in the area of voting rights.

  We have had a couple of cases--Presley v. Atoka County, not to
mention Shaw v. Reno--cases in which the history surrounding the
enactment of the Voting Rights Act might have led--I am not pre-
judging whether it would have--but might have led to a different
conclusion.

  So I would like your view in general on to what extent should
real life history, whether it is the civil rights history in this country
or the history of women in this country or the history of workers
in this country, that history, to what extent do you see history as
a guide to decisionmaking?

  Judge BREYER. At a general level, at a statement of generality,
of course, I think the more realism, the better. I do think that laws
are supposed to, when fitted together, work according to their pur-
poses. I do not think a court can know whether an interpretation
is correct until it understands both the purpose and how the inter-
pretation is likely in light of that purpose to work out in the world,
in the actual world. And history and real fact is important, often,
to make a sensible judgment. So at a general level, I think it is im-
portant.
                                                268

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Specifically with regard to the Voting
Rights Act cases, and there are several--and in fact, I was de-
lighted, Judge Breyer, in a decision that you wrote in Latino Politi-
cal Action Committee, where you referenced a case that I tried, or
at least was one of the group, the Rybicki case that came out of
Illinois; I was involved with that redistricting case--without going
into the facts or the circumstances around Rybicki specifically, I
would like to ask you a question in general, that under the 13th
and 14th and 15th amendments, which have been referenced here,
the interests of minorities in this society stand to be--the Court
has an obligation to eliminate forms of racial discrimination and
talk the step forward whether or not the specific words of the lan-
guage of the statute suggest that result.

  Judge BREYER. Such is very often likely to be the purpose of the
civil rights statute, and one normally interprets language in light
of its purpose. I am hesitant to go into the details of voting rights,
because if there is one case that is bound to come back to the Su-
preme Court, and if I am on it, I would have to get involved, is
Shaw v. Reno. That is my problem in that.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think that the Voting Rights Act
area, you are right, is a contentious and controversial one, but I
think it is important, again, to have a sense of how you would ap-
proach these issues.

  Yesterday, when we were talking, you said--and I am going to
quote a little bit, or at least paraphrase--you said the need for dig-
nity does not change, but the conditions that impact on dignity do.
And I would like to explore with you for a moment questions per-
taining to the whole notion of dignity and the rights of privacy and
to explore for a moment the constitutional basis that you see the
right of privacy as coming out of.

  The different Justices that have written about privacy, frankly,
have seen it as coming out of different parts of the Constitution.
In the Griswold v. Connecticut case, the right to privacy was seen
by Justice Goldberg, your mentor, as emanating from the ninth
amendment's limitations. In Roe v. Wade, Justice Blackmun saw it
as coming out of the 14th amendment's concept of liberty. Justice
Brandeis has suggested that a right to privacy comes out of the
fourth amendment.

  From where do you see the right of privacy emerging? I believe
you have said previously that you believe a right to privacy exists
in the Constitution. In your constitutional analysis, how do you see
that the right of privacy emerges?

  Judge BREYER. Basically, I think that word "liberty" in the 14th
amendment has been recognized by most--almost all--modern
judges on the Supreme Court, and is pretty widely accepted, that
that word "liberty" includes a number of basic, important things
that are not those only listed in the first eight amendments to the
Constitution.

  And the ninth amendment helps make that very clear, because
it says do not use that fact of the first eight to reason to the conclu-
sion that there are no others.

  So it is not surprising to me that there is widespread recognition
that that word "liberty" does encompass something on the order of
privacy. People have described those basic rights not mentioned in
                                      269

words like "concept of ordered liberty," that which the traditions of
our people realize or recognize as fundamental, and in looking to
try to decide what is the content of that, I think judges have start-
ed with text, and after all, in amendments to the Constitution,
there are words that suggest that in different contexts, privacy was
important. They go back to the history; they look at what the
Framers intended; they look at traditions over time; they look at
how those traditions have worked out as history has changed, and
they are careful, they are careful, because eventually, 20 or 30
years from now, other people will look back at the interpretations
that this generation writes if they are judges, and they will say:
Were they right to say that that ought permanently to have been
the law?

  If the answer to that question is yes, then the judges of today
were right in finding that that was a basic value that the Framers
of the Constitution intended to have enshrined. That is a kind of
test of objectivity. But the source I think is the 14th amendment
and that word "liberty."

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. The notion of liberty arises, obviously,
in a number of different areas, and I think there has been some
examination here on this committee, but I just would like for my
own edification to really get a specific response from you. This goes
to the issue of a woman's right to choose.

  Justice Ginsburg a year ago said that she believed that a wom-
an's right was part of the essential dignity of the individual; and
of course, the notion of privacy has also been referred to as the
right to be left alone. And I guess my specific question is whether
you would believe that a woman's right to be left alone means the
right to be left alone with regard to as intimate a decision as
whether or not to be pregnant.

  Judge BREYER. That is the determination of Roe v. Wade. Roe v.
Wade is the law of this country, at least for more than 20 years,
that there is some kind of basic right of the nature that you de-
scribe.

  Recently, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that right in Casey
v. Planned Parenthood. So, in my opinion, that is settled law.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Good. OK.
  I want to move along to talk about privacy because, again, this
is such an important area. Judge, you joined in a decision in the
case of Daury v. Smith, which purported to recognize that individ-
uals have a right to informational privacy. It has been touched on
here in this committee previously because in this information age,
with all the technologies that put more and more of our personal
information "on-line," the individual's interest in avoiding disclo-
sure of personal matters is and will be a more and more important
issue.
  So, briefly, do you believe that there is, in fact, a constitutional
right to informational privacy, privacy about one's person? And how
do you see that right emerging? Do you see that as coming out of
the 14th amendment or otherwise? Do you see it as a fundamental
right, the right not to distribute personal information about one-
self, whether it is to credit bureaus or, E-mail readers or others?
  Judge BREYER. There I cannot talk about settled law because
that is not settled. And I am quite certain that the scope of the
                                               270

right to privacy that is within that word liberty, I am quite certain
that that will be a matter that is going to be litigated.

  That there is a privacy interest of the sort that you suggest I
think is clear. How that interplays with other rights and how that
ends up being decided in a particular court case is something I
think I have to leave to the briefs and the arguments and thinking
about the particular case as it might come up.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. YOU are right, this is an emerging
area.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, it is.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. And it is a very important one.
  Judge BREYER. It is important.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. But, specifically, we run into with re-
gard--Congress has legislated in this area on kind of an ad hoc
basis. There has not been any comprehensive protection to informa-
tional privacy. We are moving to create an information super-
highway. We have not yet put up any stop signs.
  The question is whether or not--and this is a hypothetical I
would like to explore with you--whether or not you believe that the
protections, the privacy protections in the Constitution, would ex-
tend to private action with regard to, again, informational privacy,
with regard to one's capacity to control specific information about
oneself?
  Judge BREYER. Control it in respect to State efforts to uncover
it and so forth?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, that is the other side of it.
  Judge BREYER. DO you mean with respect to other private
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, let's start with--no, I think you
started on the right tack. Let's talk first about control with regard
to State action, which obviously is the Orwellian kind of specter
that people are, frankly, probably more attuned to and on guard
about than with regard to private action. But both, obviously, can
be of vital importance, particularly in a time when the private ac-
tion will in all probability outpace anything that the Government
might do in this area.
  Judge BREYER. I cannot give you a really good answer. The rea-
son is that normally what would happen--and I think it is what
I hear reflected in your question--is the first thing that happens
is that many, many people across the country recognize problems
in this area. Then having recognized the problems, they turn to you
or your part of the recognition, and you say, look, there are these
different interests involved. There are interests in spreading infor-
mation around rapidly. There are interests in protecting something
very important to people, which is their own basic information and
that which makes them an individual. And these things might con-
flict in the face of new technology. We are not quite certain how
they will conflict. So you listen to the technology people, you iden-
tify the interests, and then you pass laws.
  Then normally what happens to the judiciary is we decide wheth-
er there is a constitutional protection, but only in the context of the
particular law. And it is because that latter decision would arise
in a particular context that I find it difficult to go further.
                                      271

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Chairman, I understand my time
is up, but I would just like to ask a quick Matthew question, if that
is all right.

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. It would end up this line.
  My son is 16 and he plays with his computer, and he came in
about a month ago complaining that he was in one of these bulletin
boards. I have not gotten there yet. I just use it for word process-
ing. But he was playing in one of the rooms on one of these elec-
tronic bulletin boards, and he came back and said: "Somebody
changed my message. Somebody changed my"--he was really upset
and aggravated. "Somebody changed my message."
  Then he proceeded to describe for me that there is a policy that
you cannot use obscenity and the like. And he says, you know, they
will censor, whoever they are, somebody out there in the electronic
miasma somewhere. They will bleep out obscenity and things for
which they have already given their subscribers notice that these
things cannot go over the wires--well, they are not even wires, but
over this, whatever it is, the circuits. And he said that is one thing,
he said, and I understand that and that makes sense. But nobody
has a right to change my message on the bulletin board and I am
going to write them.
  And we discussed it for a moment, and it became clear that there
was no way, first, to know who had done the changing. Someone
who is involved with regulating what goes on the bulletin boards
in these rooms, these electronic places, makes these decisions. And
talking about informational privacy and all the kinds of new issues
that come up in this area, I was, frankly, appalled that this could
happen. Then I raised the question, well, what protection does the
individual user have against this sort of thing happening?
  We do not really have a lot of answers. How would you look at
that situation? Would you react as vociferously as Matthew did
about someone changing his message in this electronic room on the
bulletin board or whatever?
  Judge BREYER. Michael and I have been communicating by E-
mail back and forth from Stanford. I have been trying to learn it
a little bit, and I think I would be rather upset--and I know he
would be--if somebody were distorting his message. My message is
distorted enough without some other person.
  So I do see it is a problem, and it does seem to me that I would
react by trying to ask the questions that you are trying to ask, and
then trying to find out how this all works and how you protect peo-
ple's interest. And as I say, my guess is it would end up in legisla-
tion of some kind.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. DO you see the courts as having a role
in providing that protection?
  Judge BREYER. I would have to say it would depend on how it
got in. It is an area of such lack of knowledge to me as to the tech-
nical part that I begin with, my goodness, why would somebody be
monkeying with my message. Then I would have to see how it
arose to know whether the courts would have a role or not.
  It is reflecting ignorance on my part, but I see the importance
of the problem.
                                               272

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I do not think so. I think we are all
kind of flailing around in this area. Again, I just want to thank you
very much for your responses, and I thank the chairman for his
graciousness in allowing me to go past the red light. When you are
last, I guess you can--you get so anxious to ask your questions.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Judge, one of the most interesting little treatises I ever read was
Patterson's 'The Forgotten Ninth Amendment." I am not going to
quiz you on it. I just was curious whether you had ever read "The
Forgotten Ninth Amendment," the rights retained by the people.
It's a skinny little book in every law library.
  Judge BREYER. It rings a bell. It rings a bell. If I did, it was quite
a while ago.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you know, I am going to sound a little bit
like Paul Simon, who it is not bad sounding like, by making a sug-
gestion that you can totally disregard. I would recommend it to you
for your edification. It is not very cumbersome, and it gives a per-
spective that I think all Supreme Court Justices need. I think it
accurately reflects the fear and trepidation that they all have--and
the self-restraint they all have exercised in looking at the ninth
amendment and its applicability to the notion of unenumerated
rights. But I just cite it. You may find it at least interesting.
  Let me pick up where I left off yesterday, and not merely because
a professor at my alma mater who has been helping me out, Bill
Banks, sitting behind me, spent a lot of time helping me put this
together. You know, you are always intimidated by your professors
from your law school. Only Bill is younger than I am, so I am not
intimidated by him. But I would like to follow up on a couple
things that we started on yesterday.
  We were discussing--and I do not expect you to remember this,
you have had so many questioners. But to refresh your recollection,
we were discussing statutes where the Congress delegates to an
agency, one of the alphabet agencies, the decision of how best to
regulate. We very often, as you know from your days here, will say
we would like to clean up the environment and we would like it
to be cleaned up to a certain extent, but we are not scientists so
we are going to give that responsibility to the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, which has a battery of scientists and experts, to tell
us when it has been cleaned up sufficiently to guarantee the public
health and safety or whatever.
  We do that all the time. We do that not just in environmental
legislation but in areas like, for example, this area you were dis-
cussing with the distinguished Senator from Illinois. There are a
few of us, very few, who are experts on the computer age and the
information highway, and we will delegate certain responsibilities
to the Federal Trade Commission. We will delegate certain respon-
sibilities to the Federal Communications Commission, in part be-
cause if we did not, we would be hamstrung here. We would spend
the entirety of our time, 365 days a year, dealing with the minu-
tiae, scientific, and quasi-scientific information that we are not
equipped to deal with, notwithstanding our competent staffs. And
so I would like to talk with you about this notion of delegation and
where courts come in and where they can interject their own views.
                                               273

  More specifically, we were talking about whether it is appro-
priate for a judge to second-guess the agency's regulators, the agen-
cy's regulations as promulgated, because the judge thinks that the
cost of the regulation outweighs the benefits.

  Now, in discussing the case overturning EPA's ban on asbestos,
you said, and I quote, "It is not a very good idea for courts to get
involved in making that decision." And I subscribe to that view.
But in United States v. Ottati and Goss, you upheld a lower court's
decision rejecting the Environmental Protection Agency's judgment
as to what level of cleanliness was appropriate as it related to how
much of the hazardous waste on a particular site had to be cleaned
up or to what degree the site had to be cleaned of hazardous waste.

  More specifically, the site in question was contaminated with
PCB's, and the area was zoned for--although the homes were not
built--single-family homes.

  The EPA wanted a high level of cleanup to, in their view, ade-
quately protect children who might live and play on that site in the
future. And the cleanup--I know you know all this, but for the
record, the cleanup EPA believed was necessary cost $9 million
above what the developer felt was necessary to sufficiently clean up
the site.

  The lower court judge said that the additional $9 million to
ratchet up the cleanliness of the site was too much. And as I read
the case and read your opinion, that was based on the lower court
judge's own view of the cost and benefits.

  Now, you approved the lower court decision, which was appealed
up to you in the first circuit, saying that from the record in the
case--"one might conclude that this amounts to a very high cost for
a very little extra safety."

  Now, why do you think that the question of how much it cost to
clean up a site was a decision for the court instead of the EPA in
this case? It seems to contradict your earlier statement.

  Judge BREYER. The case was rather special in that respect, very
special. As the beginning of the case points out, to put it in its sim-
plest terms, when I wrote it, as far as the standard of review is
concerned, what courts should do when an agency decides some-
thing is to respect the view of the agency and to overturn the agen-
cy only if it is arbitrary or capricious.

  Then I listed three ways in the statute that in a normal case the
agency would make that determination. The agency has lots of pro-
cedures. They go in three different ways through those procedures.
And they end up with something called an order. And the court
may enforce the order, and when it does, the issue is: Was the
agency right or not? And you play the agency's game. That is to
say, you overturn it only if it is arbitrary, capricious, abuse of dis-
cretion.

  In that particular case, the agency did something that was very
unusual, I thought. I do not know. I cannot tell you by actual expe-
rience how unusual, but I have never seen another one in our
court. Instead of playing what I would call the agency's game
where they went through their own procedure, they never finished
their own procedure. Instead, 10 years earlier, they had come into
court and asked the court to weigh the evidence and to issue an
injunction according to court procedure. And basically what that
                                               274

decision says is well, of course, if you or anyone else conies in and
plays the court's game in setting the facts, you follow the court's
rules. I do not think that interferes with your ability to do some-
thing because you have loads of authority to go make the decision
over in the agency.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me make sure I understand this, and I think
I do. The agency has two routes to go.

  Judge BREYER. Yes; four, actually.
  The CHAIRMAN. At least two that you have mentioned.
  Judge BREYER. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. The first route was to issue an order based on
its findings and tell the developer, whomever, clean up the site,
spend the extra $9 million. Then if he refuses to do that, the agen-
cy can go to court and say, "Enforce our order", or the builder can
go to court and say, This order is capricious, or whatever argument
they wish to make, do not make me do it.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. The second route, in this case, is for the agency
to come along and say we have assembled--and I think it was
about 40
  Judge BREYER. Oh, enormous.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. 40,000 pages of documentation to
sustain why we think the court should make the owner clean up
this site and spend an extra $9 million. But the agency did not
issue an order. Is that correct?
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. They made a request to the court, "You tell them
to do it, you issue the order."
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK; now, I in no way mean to nor do I suggest
you should have belittled the difference in the process there. So as
I understand what you are saying to me, the EPA, notwithstanding
they had these 40,000 pages of documents making their case why
they thought the extra $9 million was necessary to be spent, did
not issue an order, technically, and said, "You tell them, Judge.
You look at it, you tell them we are right, you issue the order."
  What would have happened had the agency issued the order? A
procedural difference. They have issued the order, and either the
property owner, the builder, or developer says, "I will not do it" and
starts to build, and they seek the court to shut him down. Or the
builder came in and said, "they are trying to make me pay an extra
$9 million to be able to begin to build. I do not want to do it."
  What would have come into play, if anything, that did not in
terms of the way the case did proceed?
  Judge BREYER. I believe, as I have written the case, that under
those circumstances the court would not have reviewed the record
afresh. It would have reviewed what was in back of that order
under the ordinary deferential agency standard. And it would have
said it is up to the agency, unless it is arbitrary, capricious, abuse
of discretion
  The CHAIRMAN. SO they would have looked at, theoretically, the
40,000 pages or thereabouts of the documentation that the EPA
presented, and unless they found some reason other than it seemed
awfully high, they would, in your view--or you would have as an
                                               275

appeals court judge, had they come back and used the same lan-
guage, it just seems to high, you would have been more inclined to
overrule the agency. Is that correct?

  Judge BREYER. That is right. The court.
  The CHAIRMAN. The court, I meant to say. I meant to say the
court.
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, when the Congress wants to require that
hazardous wastesites be cleaned up--and as you know better than
I do, from your experience you are well aware of it, it is an area
we are going to be confronted with. Every Army base we shut
down, I mean, we are finding these cleanup costs are by anybody's
standards staggering, even no matter what level we are talking
about cleaning up. If the Congress wants to require the hazardous
wastesites be cleaned up to a level that EPA thinks is safe, must
it explicitly tell the court, "Do not substitute your own judgment?"
Or does the arbitrary and capricious standard in your view still
prevail?
  Judge BREYER. That is the normal rule. The normal rule, the Ad-
ministrative Procedures Act.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK; the reason I asked is because, as you know,
some of your colleagues, who, I might add, have an incredible
amount of respect for you, your colleagues in academia, have writ-
ten--and I mentioned two of them yesterday, Eskridge and
Frickey. Both, I think you would agree, are well-respected, well-
known legal scholars.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. They are of the school that there is an emerging
school of thought within the Supreme Court as presently con-
stituted that is looking for--I think their phrase is--I am not posi-
tive of this exact phrase--I think it is "super-clear rules of con-
struction." So that they think, at least if I have accurately read two
of their publications, one by Eskridge on "The New Textualism"
and the other one by Eskridge and Frickey entitled "Statutory In-
terpretation as Practical Reasoning." They and others are making
the argument that the Court is, in fact, injecting the notion of law
and economics as an appropriate measure for lower courts to take
into consideration, not just merely where the agency was arbitrary
and capricious.
  Let me give you a concrete example. As you well know--and you
have expressed, I think, very well here today and yesterday--by
quoting Holmes and others, "the life of the law is not merely logic."
It is a reflection of societal values. Those values do not always lend
themselves to, what we used to say 30 years ago, slide rule com-
putations. Today we would say computer computations.
  The law is life and life ain't precise, and we up here legislate and
attempt to reflect societal values, which don't always lend them-
selves to easy weighing and computation.
  We are about to begin, at least I think we will in the next couple
of months, a major debate about health care in America. Many of
us have become much more aware of the nature and the present
functioning of the present health system. I was surprised to learn--
                                               276

although intuitively I guess I knew it--that 25 percent, one-quarter
of all the health care costs in the United States of America are
spent on the last 3 months of a person's life. Your wife knows this
probably better than either one of us do, or any of us in this room.

  It is a societal value we have made a judgment about. Rather
than take a quarter of those almost trillion dollars we spend and
spend somewhere between $150 billion and $250 billion on the
young and immunization, which might very well, if you were look-
ing at it purely from a utilitarian standpoint, provide for the great-
er good for a greater number and the collective better health of all
America, we as a society have decided we do not have the view that
has been expressed in some early cultures where, when you get old
enough, your requirement is to crawl off into the bushes and die,
so you don't impact on the tribe, on the society. We have con-
sciously made a decision, no, we are willing to do the economically
imprudent thing, spend one-quarter of all our resources on the last
3 months of a life, the average life expectancy of men and women
roughly 70 years of age.

  Now, when and if we continue to make that decision--there was
an interesting article in my hometown paper on Sunday, unrelated
to your confirmation hearing. There was a big article about these
difficult choices. Dr. Frederick Plum, who is probably the finest
neurologist in all of America, probably the best known, has written
about this, as well.

  There was a man who was asked by a reporter, well, how do you
feel about spending an incredible amount on your grandmother,
who is very old, who lived only an additional short period of time.
And the man answered, it was worth it all to see the look on her
face when she got to see her great-grandchild.

  Now, it sounds corny, but they are the kinds of judgments we are
making as a society.

  What does Congress have to do to make sure that when we make
those kinds of decisions, if we do, that we do not raise the bar on
the societal judgments made by Congress and signed by the Presi-
dent on Government actions by putting into effect a new rule of
construction, a canon of construction, like one of our witnesses who
will testify on Friday has written about, and that is the presump-
tion that is argued by some very bright people that the Court
should presume, if the Congress does not specifically mention do
not weigh the cost, that this effectively requires the Congress to
anticipate that the courts should presume that they, the Congress,
wanted the courts to do this balancing test on the economy. How
do you respond to that whole school of thought? I am not asking
you to respond to any specific case. Discuss that with me a little
bit.

  Judge BREYER. It is foreign to me. I mean, it is foreign to me.
What I have written about it is that that is the kind of decision--
my goodness, it is health, it is safety. There is no economics that
tells you the right result in that kind of area. There is no econom-
ics that tells you or me or all of us how much we are prepared to
spend or should spend on the life of another person. There is noth-
ing that tells us the answer to that in some kind of economics book
that I am aware of.
                                               277

  And also, that is so much a decision that people will make
through their elected representatives. It is a democratically made
decision. Judges are not democratically elected. I mean, it is ex-
actly the kind of reason, in my own view, that it is very important
for courts--and I have written this, I have written this--it is so im-
portant for courts, which are not good institutions to make those
kinds of technical choices because judges are cut off from informa-
tion that would be relevant, among many other reasons, and they
do not have the time, among many other reasons, and they do not
have the contact with the people, among many other reasons, and
there are just dozens of reasons which I have spelled out why they
are not good institutions to make those kinds of decisions.

  So that reinforces what I have tended to write, that it is impor-
tant for courts to go back to try to understand the human purposes
that are moving those in Congress who write these statutes when
they interpret them.

  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate the answer, and I have read your
Law Review article where you essentially say that, and you have
cleared up for me--just as I frankly thought you would--the appar-
ent--apparent--inconsistency in the Ottati and Goss case, where
that was based upon the manner in which the agency brought the
matter before the Court.

  Now, my staff is urging me to go to the end, because my time
is running out, and speak about another area, but since I am chair-
man and have such a wonderful cochairman here, I am sure he will
let me run over a little bit, and I will ask both my questions.

  Senator HATCH. Sure; go ahead, Joe.
  The CHAIRMAN. It comes with being here 22 years.
  All kidding aside, let me quickly try to touch these last two
areas, and I do not think I will have any more questions for you.
  I mentioned, again, my concern about raising the bar, and we
talked a little bit about that today. Senator Brown raised issues
that related to this, and balancing tests, and stages, and I inter-
jected and asked about the distinction between the test of whether
or not as a black person, I can live in a neighborhood, and whether
or not I can build a 20-story building in the neighborhood. They are
very different things, and you explained that you in fact did see
gradations and requirements as a judge to look at them slightly dif-
ferently.
  But one of the ways to raise the bar, to use the expression I have
been using again, is by the Court requiring Congress to speak in
a super-plain, super-clear way when they interpret the statutes we
write and signed by the President. And it is argued by the
textualists--and these phrases change all the time, but I am in
your territory here, and I need not explain any of this to you--that
you look only at the literal language--not you, but some, like Jus-
tice Scalia, very articulately argue you just look at the literal lan-
guage, ignoring the context and history. And Senator Moseley-
Braun asked you about context and history as well.
  I mentioned yesterday the Patterson case as an example of a case
where the Court looked at a statute, a statute passed by the Con-
gress after the Civil War, over 100 years ago, to guarantee citizens
of all races equal rights. The Court held that the statute's lan-
guage, which gave all citizens the same right to "make and enforce
                                               278

contracts," did not protect the black employee from racial discrimi-
nation after she was hired. The irony is she could be demeaned
after she was hired, but she could not be demeaned during the job
interview process while she was being considered. And I think the
average person would think that is not a very common sense read-
ing.

  The Court read the literal language of the statute very narrowly
and supported doing so by looking outside the statute to another
law passed 100 years later. It said that, well, in 1964, the Congress
passed the Civil Rights Act, which really is the area where this
case should be brought. So therefore, we are going to assume, by
reading the literal language of this post Civil War statute, that
they did not mean to cover this because 100 years later, Congress
came along and explicitly covered it. But they did not look at the
legislative history of the action in the 1960's, which specifically
said in the legislative history we do not mean in any way to over-
rule or affect or change the statute passed in the 1870's.

  Now, if you will, how would you have approached the Patterson
case had you been on the Court?

  Judge BREYER. I do not want to discuss the particular case, but
I can say from what I have said and what I have written, it is a
fair assumption that I would have looked at the legislative history,
because I think when you read statutes, and you are trying to un-
derstand what is the human purpose that you and Congress have
in mind, a very good way to do it is you look at the legislative his-
tory. That does not always give you the answer, but very often, it
helps.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me skip, then, quickly to Dellmuth v.
Muth, where it seems to me the Court, in the name of doing the
same thing, reached an exact opposite conclusion interpreting an-
other statute. That statute, as you well know, was passed through
the work--and I do not want to get them in trouble--but through
the work of Senators Kennedy, Hatch, Dole, and others. We passed
a law relating to--we all voted for it--passed a law relating to the
handicapped. And we said that if a handicapped person's rights are
being denied, as written under this legislation, by a State--we did
not say it explicitly, but at least we implied--that the individual
whose rights were not being guaranteed under the legislation could
sue the State in Federal court for money damages.

  I think Patterson and Dellmuth were decided the same day; I
think they were handed down the exact same day. I remember in
Patterson, they said we are going to look at the literal language,
and we are going to read into the language that they must have
meant look 100 years hence and see if that statute that passed in
any way affects the reading of this statute.

  In Dellmuth, they looked at the statute and said, you know,
there is a presumption that has existed in the law, a canon if you
will, in legislative interpretation, against allowing individual citi-
zens to sue States in Federal court. They looked at the 11th
amendment and other areas to conclude that. And they said not-
withstanding the fact--in my words; I am paraphrasing--notwith-
standing the fact that a common sense reading of Dellmuth might
lead you to believe that a citizen had a right to sue the State in
Federal court, we are going to presume that the Congress meant
                             279

to do something other than that, because they must have known
that there is an existing presumption against that, and because
they did not explicitly say in the statute you are able to sue not-
withstanding previous presumptions in the law, we are going to
rule that that person cannot sue the State of New York in Federal
court.
The end result was the same. In one case, a black woman's eq-
uity rights were diminished. In the other case, a handicapped per-
son's rights were denied in terms of suing.
You did not write either case, and I am not asking you how you
would have decided it, but how do you reconcile those two cases in
terms of statutory interpretation?
Judge BREYER. What I have said that is, I think, relevant in
writing, what I have said which I think is relevant to the question
that you posed, are really two things--that, one, if you are not cer-
tain about what the statute means--in all of these open, big, im-
portant cases, in any court, language rarely resolves it; otherwise,
why is it in court--but go look at the legislative history. The dis-
sents in both cases did look at the legislative history. The dissents
felt that the legislative history showed that the interpretation of
the majority was incorrect.
So on the basis of what I have written there, I have said, well,
sometimes legislative history helps, and I guess my instinct would
have been to go look at it.
The other thing, which is--I understand that other people may
disagree, and all of this is very debatable--but I have said beware
of these canons. Why do I say beware? Well, the clear statement
canons have a very respectable pedigree. In countries that do not
have written constitutions, very important countries, they have
served as protection of human liberty, because judges have some-
times said in those countries: We are not going to interpret a stat-
ute to infringe on a basic human liberty unless the legislature is
very clear. And that has served in those countries sometimes as a
substitute for a written constitution. We do not find that here as
often because we have a written Constitution.
But the danger with the clear statement rule which I saw and
wrote about is you can       pinrotolifseoramteeththinegsecarluleldes,"ya°nudhaavseytoou  pro-
liferate them, as you get                                                                 state
the matter clearly if Congress wants to legislate a departure from
traditional equity powers," I begin to think: What is this; who will
know it; how will people understand it; how will drafters know
what to draft; how will ordinary lawyers and those who must take
their advice know to interpret the statute? It becomes also very
complicated.
The CHAIRMAN. Or, as Brennan said in dissent in Patterson, that
Congress would need "a particularly effective crystal ball."
Judge BREYER. Well, I have argued that it is easier, simpler,
more accessible; despite the fact that use of legislative history can
be abused and should not be, it is still simpler to go and look to
that in many cases where it is helpful.
Now, other people present very strong arguments for the other
point of view, and they cannot be just dismissed, those arguments.
But that is basically
The CHAIRMAN. NO; I am not just dismissing them
                                               280

  Judge BREYER. NO; I know you are not.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. But then again, they are not before
us, and they are not asking to go on the Court. Others who share
the opposite view than I do are already on the Court. I just wish
I had been smarter then and known what was coming and under-
stood just how strongly Mr. Justice Scalia felt about some of these
things. I think he is one of the finest men I know, but it is the vote
I most regret ever having cast out of over 10,000 I have cast--not
because of his character, but we have such a difference of views--
and I have told him that. I mean, we joke about it. I told you he
found out I was teaching constitutional law at Widener Law School,
and he said, "Oh, my God, I had better come to protect those stu-
dents." So he shares the same view about me.
  At any rate, let me close with two short questions on one last
subject. That is this notion of unconstitutional conditions. I would
like to return to the first case I asked you about, Dolan v. Tigert--
and I hope I am pronouncing "Tigert" correctly--the takings clause
case. But I would like to look at a slightly different question.
  The majority in Dolan rejected the town's measure because it im-
posed what they referred to as an unconstitutional condition when
it said that the business owner could only get a permit to expand
her store if she agreed to give up the use of part of her land. An
unconstitutional condition, as you know, occurs, to oversimplify it,
when the Government forces us to give up a right voluntarily in
exchange for getting something we badly need or want or are other-
wise entitled to.
  Now, you considered the question of unconstitutional conditions
in the case of HHS v. Massachusetts. A Federal regulation forced
doctors in family planning clinics to agree not to give certain medi-
cal advice as a condition to accepting Federal funds. You joined an
opinion ruling that this was an unconstitutional condition on free
expression, the first amendment--basically, that doctors were not
allowed to give advice about alternatives to women.
  The Supreme Court, when up on appeal, disagreed; one of the
few cases in which you were in the majority on the first circuit that
I am aware of that the Supreme Court disagreed with. In the case
testing the same regulation, Rust v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court
found no violation of the first amendment. And I think, quite
frankly, the Court, from my perspective--it will come as a great
shock to you, I know--I think the Court got both Rust and Dolan
wrong. In one case, it gave a businesswoman's economic interest
more protection than it gave a doctor's freedom of expression stated
in the first amendment.
  Now, what do you make of these results? Can you reconcile the
cases? You were not in either one of them. I am not asking you how
you would vote had you been there. But can you reconcile finding
an unconstitutional condition as it related to a property owner's
right relative to a bicycle path and not finding an unconstitutional
condition where the first amendment was at least in question.
  Judge BREYER. YOU obviously, Senator, find them difficult to rec-
oncile

   The CHAIRMAN. I do.

  Judge BREYER [continuing]. And of course, I wrote one of the
opinions the other way, and if you went to a district judge on my
                                      281
court that had an opinion that was reversed by a panel that I was
on, and you asked, do you think that that condition is consistent
with some others, he would say absolutely not. So I am sort of in
a sense a party in interest, so I do not think I will go beyond

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, no; I think it is fair to ask you, not what
your view--obviously, I know what your view is relative to Rust.
You thought the first amendment was implicated, and it was an
unconstitutional condition.

  What I am trying to ask you is not whether you think the other
should have been decided, but how are they different, how are they
the same? I mean, has something changed? Is there something in
the Supreme Court right now that is able to find an unconstitu-
tional condition relative to a property right affecting essentially a
zoning regulation, and not find an unconstitutional condition in the
first among our amendments? Play professor with me for a mo-
ment.

  Judge BREYER. I try to resist that temptation, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, go ahead. Let yourself go. It is OK.
  Judge BREYER. I am not certain you are asking me to guess what
other people would say.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO; I am just trying to--how would you explain
it to a class?
  Judge BREYER. I am not sure--you would say in one case, you
are talking about a Government program; in the other case, you
are talking about regulation of property. In the regulation case, the
Court feels it went too far. It was like those pillars of coal, and the
Court felt it went too far, and they did not show enough justifica-
tion, and they felt that was important because of the underlying in-
terest that they thought was a very important interest, and you
have shown more since there was some land of possession of phys-
ical property.
  In the other case, they would say, well, I guess, that the impact
on this, on whatever right is involved, is not as significant or is
changed because of the funding nature of the program, because it
was a program the Government did not have to create in the first
place.
  Those are the lines of reasoning that it is trying to take.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me end--I have trespassed on everyone's
time too much--let me just end with this. In an age where, rightly
or wrongly, citizens depend on government to provide many needed
services--wealthy citizens as well as indigent citizens--doesn't
Rust show that the Court can significantly limit our personal rights
through indirect and more subtle means?
  Judge BREYER. It just seems to me that I probably, if I am con-
firmed, will have to deal with a lot of cases that try to go into this.
And they are difficult cases, and the Court disagrees about a lot
of issues that come up, and you have to try to work them out and
try to figure them out in light of the briefs and the arguments
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I will let you go on it, but I want to make
it clear this is not about choice, this is not about abortion. This is
about the notion which has been raised here on every matter that
the Government is involved. There are those among us, left and
right, in the Senate who are going to say because Government
money is involved, we want to attach a condition. I predict to you
                                               282

that you will be faced with a myriad of cases in your long tenure
on the Court where you are going to have to come up with, if you
will, various rules of construction to make a judgment about where
it is appropriate and inappropriate. You are going to have liberal
Senators who are extremely well respected, like Senator Simon and
others, considering whether or not we condition the ability to get
a license for broadcasting on whether or not they show violence on
television. I doubt whether he will do that, but others will raise
that question.

  You will find that conservatives suggest that in order to get
money for the arts, there must be a certain standard that is met.
This has been raised. I put Rust in that context.

  I think the problem we have--and I will end with this--is we be-
come--we, on this side of the bench--are somewhat myopic. We
look at the subject matter that is being debated rather than the
substance of what is being debated. Rust does not concern me be-
cause it relates to the ability of a doctor to talk about the availabil-
ity of something other than birth. It concerns me because it seems
to set a precedent that suggests that a condition can be placed on
a fundamental constitutional right--freedom of expression, freedom
of movement--it can be anything.

  So I, like all of us, am going to end up having to take a chance
on what we think your instincts and methodology are. I am pre-
pared to take that chance, and I am confident you will think a lot
about this, and I am also confident--not because I said it, but be-
cause it is a'coming, Judge, in a big way in this Congress and suc-
ceeding Congresses, and it is something no one is writing very
much about now, but I predict to you it will be written about; it
will fill volumes before this decade is over.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the chairman yield just for a mo-
ment, just for a hot moment, because I know everyone is anxious
to go, and Judge Breyer has been more than patient.

  The CHAIRMAN. I yield the floor.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. My question in that regard is would
you see the possibility of unconstitutional conditions coming in
areas other than first amendment--because the first amendment is
such a slippery slope, and that gets us into all of these kinds of
questions the chairman has just raised on arts and violence on tele-
vision--but other than the first amendment, would you see the pos-
sibility of an unconstitutional condition arising in other areas?
  Judge BREYER. My guess is--and it is a guess--that there could
arise conditions that people would argue violate a host of different
amendments--fair trial--I do not know--there are lots of different
parts. I think the answer is yes, but it is a guess.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I cannot think of a single amendment that would
not qualify except the ninth, and that is only because the folks who
are applying these unconstitutional conditions do not believe there
is a ninth amendment. But that is another question.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. But Mr. Chairman, again, the reason
I raise the question--I think it came up--I do not know who it
was--Senator Cohen may have raised it earlier today--the issue of
the leases in public housing in my own State comes immediately
to mind. Again, I think this is an area where, right, there has not
                                              283

been a lot done in this area, but it certainly is one that will no
doubt in Judge Breyer's long tenure on the court come up before
the Court.

  Again, I apologize for interrupting, and I thank the chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, and I thank Senator Hatch for let-
ting me go over. I will have no more questions for the remainder
of this hearing. I will yield to Senator Hatch, and we will close
with Senator Hatch's questioning.
  Would you like a break?
  Judge BREYER. NO; I am fine.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then we will finish with Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Judge, after hearing Senator Biden's predictions
of how tough it is going to be on the Court, maybe you want to
withdraw.
  Judge BREYER. NO, thanks.
  Senator HATCH. Actually, when you are talking about the Rust
case, you are talking about a funded speech case instead of a free
speech case. Basically, it should be pointed out that the case
  The CHAIRMAN. That is the whole point.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. You made the point; I thought you
did make it rather well--that the case involved regulations govern-
ing Federal funding of title X family planning programs. And those
regulations did not bar any speech; they simply prevented the use
of Federal Government dollars to fund pro-abortion counseling and
referrals.
  Now, it was a perfect illustration of how the Court ruled one way
and the Congress of the United States overruled the Court in an
appropriate way, according to the majority. I happen to disagree
with that, but it was the way the democratic system should work.
So I would submit it is a funded speech case instead of a free
speech case. Nothing would have prevented the doctor from speak-
ing as freely as the doctor wanted to. He just could not use Federal
dollars to do it under the Court's ruling.
  I would feel very badly if I did not say a few words about Justice
Scalia, because I think there are some misinterpretations here that
conservative jurists like Justice Scalia are inconsistent in their ap-
proaches to statutory and constitutional interpretations. Some are
arguing that. But let me quote from a Law Review article that is
critical of Justice Scalia's method of statutory interpretation, but
an article which is also critical of many of his critics as well. It
says:

  Many of Justice Scalia's critics point to an apparent inconsistency in his approach
to constitutional provisions as opposed to statutes. While he takes a "textualist" ap-
proach to statutes and criticizes the use of legislative history to establish legislative
intent, they argue, he takes a sharply originalist turn in constitutional adjudication,
basing his arguments on the intentions of the Framers. Justice Scalia does indeed
consider himself an originalist in constitutional adjudication, but his brand of
originalism does not rest on the intent of the Framers as revealed in the proceed-
ings of the Philadelphia Convention. Instead, he relies upon the original under-
standing of constitutional terms, based on arguments similar to those he uses in in-
terpreting statutes. These include arguments from text, context, purpose, contem-
poraneous usage of language, and the structure of the constitutional scheme, includ-
ing separation of powers and federalism.

  I think that is a more accurate description of Justice Scalia. In
other words, Justice Scalia's statutory interpretation and constitu-
                                         284

tional jurisprudence of original meaning are really consistent. And
you have pointed that out.

  Now, you would go farther, and perhaps I would also, in looking
at what the Senators and Congresspeople have said from the
standpoint of statutory construction and also legislative history and
examine that. I see nothing wrong with that, either.

  But you, having been upon Capitol Hill and realizing that this
sausage that we call legislation, how it is made sometimes, you
have to very carefully--and I think this is what Scalia is saying--
look behind, really, what the words are to really find what was
really meant, because as you know, sometimes they just throw
whole statements into the record that nobody debates at all. All
they have got to do is sign it and put it in the record, and they
can skew any legislative history any way they want to.

  So I think you would agree, would you not, that you have to be
very careful when you look at legislative history, that you just do
not buy all the words that are put there by Members of Congress
or members of State legislatures or Federal bureaucrats or the
President; right?

  Judge BREYER. Yes; you use it; you do not abuse it.
  Senator HATCH. That is right, and I think you have made that
pretty clear, and I want to compliment you for doing that as well.
  I have some differences with Senator Biden on the takings issue
also, and I have to say I also differ with Chairman Biden on Patter-
son v. McLean. In that case, in my view, the Supreme Court re-
sisted legislating from the Bench to reach a feel-good result. The
Court respected the differing roles of the judiciary and the legisla-
ture and properly left to the Congress the role of revising the stat-
ute in question, rather than injecting the Court's own policy pref-
erences in the matter. In Patterson, the primary issue was whether
section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1966, also known as section
1981, prohibited racial harassment on the job. And frankly, we
have to note that it is not an employment discrimination statute.
It reads in pertinent part:

  All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right,
in every State and Territory, to make and enforce contracts.

  Now, the Court said that the statute does not reach conduct oc-
curring after the contract has been made. The statute does not
cover the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," as title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does. Indeed, the absence of such
a broad statute was one reason that title VII became necessary in
the first place. So the Court ruled maybe too narrowly, certainly in
the eyes of the Congress, which later in a sense overruled that, but
nevertheless ruled properly because that was the language of the
statute; it was the meaning at the time. And we were able to cor-
rect that, and I participated in doing so, as a statutory result.

  Isn't that a correct
  Judge BREYER. Not discussing the merits of the case; that is, I
did think that probably my instinct would have been to look at the
legislative history, but I have not looked at it and do not know
what I would have found.
  Senator HATCH. Well, that is right. And I think sometimes we
get too caught up in this Scalia debate on whether or not he means
anything with regard to looking at original meaning and what
                                      285
those original words meant and what the context of those original
words actually meant, when actually, he means a lot more than
just trying to interpret the law on a very narrow basis. And I think
you know that; right?

  Judge BREYER. I have attended lectures that he has given; they
are very interesting, and I think it is more. I agree with you. He
has a theory

  Senator HATCH. I wish I could be in some of those meetings, lis-
tening to you and Scalia, because I believe that you and Scalia are
going to become very good friends. I am going to encourage him.
[Laughter.]

  And I believe you will be very good for each other. You are two
brilliant intellects, and both of you are excellent lawyers, and both
of you are, in my opinion, very, very fine people. So I suspect you
are going to really like each other, although you will differ from
time to time. And we will just have to see what happens. I will be
carefully reading and watching, however.

  Now, let me just return briefly to the subject of the establish-
ment clause--and I do not want to keep you too late; I know this
is very tiring, and I know that you have had a long day, but these
are really important issues, and I apologize for keeping you a little
longer. But in your testimony yesterday, you stated that "when I
think of the establishment clause, I think of Jefferson, and I think
of a wall."

  Now, I was a little bit surprised by your use of the wall meta-
phor, because it seems to me in tension with your fine concurrence
in the case called Members of Jamestown School Community v.
Schmidt, back in 1983, in your circuit. As you will recall, in that
case, the first circuit largely upheld a Rhode Island statute provid-
ing bus transportation for nonpublic school children, including chil-
dren attending religious schools. And in your concurrence, you
found that the majority opinion was too hostile to neutral State
programs that provide proportionate benefits to students who at-
tend religious schools. In particular, as I read the case, you stated
that you "believe the establishment clause calls for a more practical
approach to this type of problem than the comparatively theoretical
approach taken by the majority."

  Now, it seems to me that the wall metaphor--which, incidentally,
is not derived from the Constitution itself, or from ratification de-
bates, but rather from a private letter written by Thomas Jefferson
years later--reflects the very type of impractical theoretical ap-
proach that you criticized in your concurrence in that case. It cer-
tainly is not a metaphor that assists analysis, in my opinion. And
moreover, it is most often used by those who are hostile to govern-
mental accommodation to religion.

  So I think it is an overused metaphor, between you and me, and
I think you pretty well stated that in your concurring opinion in
that case. And as you know, Supreme Court opinions clearly ap-
pear to uphold the constitutionality of a school voucher system that
enables students to choose among various schools, including reli-
gious schools.

  Now, some people think that introducing competition into our
school system would--and I personally believe that--promote a
much needed improvement in quality. So I was encouraged by your
                                                286

Jamestown concurrence to believe that you would also support such
a voucher system against establishment clause challenge.

  Now, without asking your views on a voucher system, I might
just mention maybe in predicate to that, vouchers, it seems to me,
would eliminate many of the thorny issues that arise because many
students as a practical matter are compelled to attend public
schools. And a lot of these issues you have been grappling with,
both as a judge and in these hearings, it seems to me might be
eliminated if a voucher system were used. But without asking your
views on a voucher system, I would like to know whether you ad-
here to the views that you gave in your Jamestown concurrence.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I thought you would. And do you think I
have misstated it?
  Judge BREYER. NO; I think that the point of the practical ap-
proach is you have instances in which the question under the es-
tablishment clause is has the Government injected religion too far
into a secular institution. That is not what you are talking about
now.
  Senator HATCH. That is right.
  Judge BREYER. YOU are talking about the other issue, which is
to what extent can the Government aid a religious institution. And
there, I have said several times, and I certainly think that the an-
swer is zero. Everybody understands that the fire department will
go put out the fire in the church. Everyone understands that the
church will benefit in many ways from all kinds of public services.
Everyone understands that the church school will.
  But the question becomes--and this is what I think is a practical
question--when does it go too far and suddenly become what looks
like the State support of one religion against another, or religion
against nonreligion. If the State would support my synagogue, I
might think: Fine. If they are going to support somebody else's
church, I might think: Hmm. And each church might think: The
other, no, but mine, yes. But we live in a society of so many dif-
ferent groups that it is important that those groups do not see the
State as supporting the religion of another, or religion versus--I
mean, that is the basic theory, and I think these are practical ques-
tions about when the age when the church is
  Senator HATCH. SO you have an open mind with regard to these
establishment questions.
  Judge BREYER. I would hope so. I would hope so.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I believe you do. But let me just introduce
an institutional question of how a Justice should decide a constitu-
tional question where the relevant constitutional clause is unclear.
It has been suggested by one of my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle that a Justice should err on the side of freedom. Putting
aside the fact that virtually every case involves competing free-
doms, it seems to me that just as the Constitution does not en-
shrine an economic theory of unbridled free enterprise, it also does
not enshrine a political theory of radical libertarianism, either.
  Now, you agreed with me yesterday that a judge's legitimacy de-
rives solely from the fact that the judge is applying the law. Where
the Constitution is unclear on an issue; what authority then does
a Justice have to override the result reached by the political
                                               287

branches whose members, it must not be forgotten, are also sworn
to uphold the Constitution? Stated differently, if the meaning or
application of a relevant constitutional clause in a particular case
is at bottom unclear, how can that unclear clause provide a Justice
the mandate needed to strike down a law as being in conflict with
it?

  Judge BREYER. Where a clause is unclear, there is no escaping
the requirement to find its meaning. The meaning, once found,
might be consistent with the legislative enactment, or it might not.
Obviously, in finding its meaning, a Court is also guided by the
Constitution's own division of authority into three separate
branches, and its understanding that legislation is given to the leg-
islature to enact, that is, Congress.

  But one does have to find the meaning; otherwise, there is no
way to know how to decide the case. To find the meaning, you
begin with the text, but as you say, the text is very unclear in the
example you are thinking of. You go back into history, and you look
at what the Framers are likely to have intended. And often--or
sometimes, anyway--that will not answer the question, because
they may have intended the meaning to encapsulate certain impor-
tant values, which values may stay the same, but the conditions in
which they are applied may have changed. So you look to prece-
dent, and you look to tradition, and you look to history if the case
is really difficult. And you have to have some understanding of the
practical facts of how people live. And all those are meant to be not
unleashing the subjective opinion of the judge, but rather, as fac-
tors that inevitably in these tough cases, judges have to look to.

  Senator HATCH. Would you look to just making a guess?
  Judge BREYER. NO, you cannot just make a guess.
  Senator HATCH. Why should that become constitutional law?
  Judge BREYER. YOU cannot; you cannot just make a guess, and
there are certain chains, there are certain safeguards. I always
think an intellectual safeguard is the safeguard of the judge think-
ing to himself: Remember, the decision you make has to be one
that you believe other judges would also make if they understand
the law and do not have your personality. And remember, too, that
the decision that you make, if you are interpreting the Constitution
of the United States, is a decision that Congress cannot change. So
be careful of trying to remake the boat while it is in the middle
of the ocean. Be careful.
  Senator HATCH. All right.
  Judge BREYER. And remember, too, that 20 or 30 years from now,
you had better be thinking to yourself right now that people who
study this with care--and those are not necessarily scholars; that
can be any man, woman, child in the United States--people who
look back at this with care will think, yes, that decision interpreted
the Constitution in a way that ought permanently to be the law.
  Those are intellectual checks that try to make the factors that
I mentioned factors that do not unchain the personality of the
judge, that hold the judge back from legislating, but permit the
Constitution to adapt to changing circumstances in a way that I be-
lieve the Framers intended.
                                                288

  Senator HATCH. Let me move to just a couple of cases. You are
familiar with Washington v. Davis, which is of course an equal pro-
tection clause case.

  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just say this. In Washington v. Davis, the
Supreme Court held that in order to trigger the strict scrutiny
standard of review under the equal protection clause, a plaintiff
must establish that a Government practice or policy with a dispar-
ate impact upon minorities was instituted with a discriminatory in-
tent. That is basically what Washington v. Davis said.
  Only if such intent is shown must the Government have a com-
pelling interest in order to justify its policy. Now, in the absence
of any showing of discriminatory intent under Washington v. Davis,
a challenged practice is subject to the rational basis standard of re-
view.
  Do you believe that Washington v. Davis is settled law; and sec-
ond, do you believe it was correctly decided?
  Judge BREYER. I know that in most of these areas--I think what
you are saying--the part that I am uncertain of--I know that when
you look at the equal protection clause pure and simple, without
a statute, I believe that that discriminatory intent test is the one
that has been applied. I think most of these areas by Congress
have been turned into statutory areas, and once you get into stat-
utes like title VII and a number of other areas, you discover the
tests, as you have tried to implement the equal protection clause,
expand into disparate impact analysis as well.
  So I suspect that most of these cases arise in the statutory con-
text rather than--at least racial discrimination, and much gender
discrimination, too, in the area of employment practices and so
forth. So I am more familiar with the statutory test. When you go
back to the equal protection clause, I think there were the three
tier analyses we were talking about, and that middle tier is up in
the air, and I tried to answer that question yesterday.
  Senator HATCH. Let me take the Croson case and the constitu-
tionality of set-asides. Do you agree with the Supreme Court's hold-
ing in Croson v. City of Richmond that all racial discrimination by
government, including discrimination against whites as well as dis-
crimination against racial minorities, is to be judged by the same
standard of strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause?
  Judge BREYER. They said strict scrutiny, and that is a very, very
difficult area, because that, very straightforward, if the area called
affirmative action, and that affirmative action area is an area
where the Court in a variety of ways has said affirmative action
is appropriate, but you had better be certain you are remedying a
real past wrong. That is necessary, in light of the real wrongs that
were committed. Then when you look at that program, if you are
righting a real past wrong, remember that affirmative action pro-
grams also have the ability to adversely affect people who them-
selves did nothing wrong, so please be certain that it is tailored
carefully.
  Then I know the courts made distinctions between taking some-
thing away from the person who did nothing wrong, like losing a
job, which they have tended to frown upon, indeed, and not giving
a person something that he never had, like a promotion, and work-
                                      289
ing out what constitutes a proper tailoring in light of the possibility
of hurting an innocent person, but in light of the need to correct
past wrongs. That has all been considered in a group of cases
which is complicated and difficult, as you can see the broad out-
lines, and Croson is one of those cases in which the Court has tried
to decide what standard or how do we know if this is really to cor-
rect a past wrong. And in Croson they decided that they didn't
think it was shown really this is necessary to carry a past wrong.

  That is my understanding of how it is working.
  Senator HATCH. I think your emphasis of people who did no
wrong is very appropriate, because we are talking about reverse
discrimination against people who really did not participate in the
discrimination.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. It is a very serious matter and should only be
used in only the most stringent of cases, which you have also point-
ed out, and some believe shouldn't be used at all, because there is
no reason for somebody to lose because of something in the past
that may have been wrong, but they didn't participate in it. So I
appreciated that distinction.
  Just two last areas, and they are both important. Judge Breyer,
let me return to the subject of the ninth amendment. Senator
Biden has raised that a number of times. Advocates of judicial ac-
tivism often cite the ninth amendment as though it were a font of
unenumerated and undefined constitutional rights to be spelled out
at the whim of Federal judges. In fact, the natural meaning of the
ninth amendment and the historical evidence lead to a very dif-
ferent conclusion, in my opinion.
  As the law review article that I called to your attention and that
you were so kind to read discusses, the Framers understood that
the Constitution protects individual rights in two very different
ways. First, and most importantly, it delegates only certain powers
to the Federal Government. Matters beyond the powers of the Fed-
eral Government are thereby residually protected as a matter of
right.
  Second, the Constitution specifically enumerates certain other
rights. As the historical evidence makes clear, the ninth amend-
ment was adopted in response to the fear that the enumeration of
certain rights in the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights
would be misconstrued to suggest that the Federal Government
had general and unlimited powers. In other words, many thought
that the inclusion of the Bill of Rights was not only unnecessary,
but positively dangerous.
  Under this reasoning, the first amendment guarantee of free
speech, for example, was not necessary, since, if the Constitution
were properly construed, the Federal Government had no enumer-
ated power that enabled it to restrict speech. So that was their rea-
soning. The unnecessary listing of rights was dangerous, because
it would invite the erroneous conclusion that the Constitution oth-
erwise vested general powers in the Federal Government.
  The ninth amendment was, therefore, adopted to make clear that
the people retained other rights by virtue of their nondelegation of
infringing powers to the Federal Government. Now, are you open
to the historical evidence that supports the view that the ninth
                                      290
amendment is not itself a source of affirmative rights against the
Federal Government, but is, instead, a reminder that the people re-
tain rights residually protected by virtue of the fact that the Fed-
eral Government is limited to the enumerated powers spelled out
elsewhere in the Constitution?

  Judge BREYER. Yes, I am open to that, because I think that in
Justice Goldberg's concurrence, what Justice Goldberg said is that
the ninth amendment is not itself a source of rights. Rather, it sug-
gests that you shouldn't make a certain kind of argument, you
shouldn't make the argument, just as you said, that the very fact
that there is a Bill of Rights here with amendments listed means
there aren't any others.

  You can't make that argument, and since you can't make the ar-
gument, I think he was addressing himself to Justice Black. Since
you can't make that argument, now let's go on to see if there are
others, and he found the others not really in the 9th amendment
at all, but found them in the 14th and the word "liberty."

  Senator HATCH. Second, do you agree that the ninth amendment
does not itself apply against the States? Do you not also agree that
the 9th amendment is not incorporated against the States through
of the due process clause of the 14th amendment?

  Judge BREYER. Well, it seems to me that the ninth amendment
is like a rule of construction, so I don't know what it would mean
to be incorporated. I don't know how that could take place. I have
never thought of how that could be. It doesn't sound as if it is the
kind of thing. It sounds like it is a rule of construction, basically,
since I have not heard the argument to the contrary.

  Senator HATCH. Well, let me go further. While I disagree with
the methodology adopted by Justice Goldberg in Griswold, that
methodology in no way supports the view that such things as abor-
tion and homosexual conduct are constitutionally protected.

  Judge BREYER. It said look to the 14th amendment, and the case
involved the right of marital privacy.

  Senator HATCH. That is right. Justice Goldberg's reasoning was
carefully confined to the marital relation and the marital home.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. AS I recall, he expressly stated that his opinion
did not call into question State laws regarding homosexual conduct.
  Judge BREYER. He didn't say that expressly, I don't think, those
words, but I think that is a fair interpretation.
  Senator HATCH. Moreover, as I view it, his reasoning, which
looks to whether a right is so rooted in the traditions and con-
science of our people, would plainly not have extended to abortion,
which has been prohibited in most instances for much of our his-
tory. Now, I am not asking you for an opinion on that. I am just
making that comment. I think it has been a stretch by some to try
and use Griswold to justify that particular opinion.
  Let me just ask one final question, and these are constitutional
questions that I think are of considerable import. In doing this, I
am asking them so that they will be out on the table, so they will
have been asked, so that nobody can say that you haven't discussed
them with the committee. So I apologize for keeping you.
  Judge BREYER. That is all right, Senator.
                                      291

  Senator HATCH. Let me just ask a few questions about the prin-
ciple of stare decisis, the common law or prudential doctrine of ad-
herence to precedence. Some have argued that a vastly different
rule of stare decisis should operate for precedent that creates a new
constitutional right, on the one hand, versus precedent that de-
clines to create a new constitutional right, on the other.

  Specifically, some have expressed the view that precedent, no
matter how incorrect, that creates a new right should rarely, if
ever, be overturned, while precedent that declines to create a new
right should be freely overturned. Some have argued for this.

  Now, under this view, for example, many liberals will argue that
cases like Roe v. Wade and Miranda are sacrosanct precedent, but
precedents like Bowers v. Hardwick, which held that there is no
constitutional right to engage in homosexual sodomy, and cases up-
holding the death penalty should be overturned.

  Now, what is your view of the theory of stare decisis?
  Judge BREYER. My view is that stare decisis is very important
to the law. Obviously, you can't have a legal system that doesn't
operate with a lot of weight given to stare decisis, because people
build their lives, they build their lives on what they believe to be
the law. And insofar as you begin to start overturning things, you
upset the lives of men, women, children, people all over the coun-
try. So be careful, because people can adjust, and even when some-
thing is wrong, they can adjust to it. And once they have adjusted,
be careful of fooling with their expectation. Now, that is the most
general forum. .
  When I become a little bit more specific, it seems to me that
there are identifiable factors that are pretty well established. If
you, as a judge, are thinking of overturning or voting to overturn
a preexisting case, what you do is ask a number of fairly specific
questions. How wrong do you think that prior precedent really was
as a matter of law, that is, how badly reasoned was it?
  You ask yourself how the law has changed since, all the adjacent
laws, all the adjacent rules and regulations, does it no longer fit.
You ask yourself how have the facts changed, has the world
changed in very important ways. You ask yourself, insofar, irre-
spective of how wrong that prior decision was as a matter of rea-
soning, how has it worked out in practice, has it proved impossible
or very difficult to administer, has it really confused matters. Fi-
nally, you look to the degree of reliance that people have had in
their ordinary lives on that previous precedent.
  Those are the kinds of questions you ask. I think you ask those
questions in relation to statutes. I think you ask those questions
in relation to the Constitution. The real difference between the two
areas is that Congress can correct a constitutional court, if it is a
statutory question, but it can't make a correction, if it is a constitu-
tional matter. So be pretty careful.
  Senator HATCH. Unless they pass a constitutional amendment to
do that.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, that's true. It is very hard to do.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just ask one last question. Does stare de-
cisis operate differently with respect to constitutional and statutory
rights?
                                      292
  Judge BREYER. In principle, I think the questions are the same,
questions that one would ask. I think that one would recognize the
difference that you just mentioned and I did about the comparative
difficulties of correcting a mistake.
  Senator HATCH. I am very concerned that giving substantial def-
erence to prior erroneous rulings on a broad range of constitutional
issues, in effect, just permits the Supreme Court to amend the Con-
stitution, without complying with the amendment procedures
spelled out in article V. I am concerned about that. There may well
be certain rulings that are so long standing and that are so
imbedded in the way that governmental institutions have devel-
oped that they are entitled to deference. But this category should
be a narrow exception, or else the Supreme Court is able to usurp
power through erroneous rulings. So I am concerned about that.
  Judge, this has been a long day. These 2 days have been long
days, but I personally believe that you have acquitted yourself
quite well.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator HATCH. We have appreciated the way that you have han-
dled these matters, and I certainly want to compliment your family
for enduring this. Please feel free to get up and walk around or
leave any time you want to. We know how difficult this is from
time to time. But it is a very important constitutional process.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, it is.
  Senator HATCH. And I want to compliment my colleagues for the
questions that they have asked during this process. I think you
have seen a lot of sincerity, a lot of dedication, a lot of desire to
try and explore some of these areas with you. But I, for one, feel
very good about most everything that you have answered here.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator HATCH. I hope you can go have a nice evening and get
a good night's rest. What we are going to do is we are going to re-
sume tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m., and we will immediately
thereafter go into closed session, as Chairman Biden previously an-
nounced.
  With that, we will recess the hearings until 9:30 in the morning.
  [Whereupon, at 6:19 p.m., the committee was in recess, to recon-
vene on Thursday, July 14, 1994, at 9:30 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN G. BREYER TO BE
  AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                            THURSDAY, JULY 14, 1994

                                                                       U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:53 a.m., in room
SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
(chairman of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Thurmond, Simp-
son, Grassley, Specter, Brown, and Cohen.
  The CHAIRMAN. Under the Senate rules, we are required to meet
in open session to seek consent to go into closed session to accom-
modate the change in the committee procedure on Supreme Court
nominees that we initiated last time around.
   So I ask unanimous consent that, pursuant to rule XXVI, the
committee proceed to vote to go into closed session to review the
FBI report in the committee's investigation of Judge Stephen
Breyer, a nominee to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   I move that the committee proceed to closed session.
   Senator HATCH. I second the motion.
  The CHAIRMAN. There is no need for a rollcall vote, unless some-
one wishes to have one. If there is no wish to have one, all those
in favor of going into closed session, signify by saying "aye".
   [A chorus of ayes.]
  The CHAIRMAN. All those opposed?
   [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The ayes have it. We will proceed to the con-
ference room behind us here. The committee will go into closed ses-
sion. We will reconvene the committee at 1 p.m. in open session.
   Now, we have a little bit of a scheduling problem. There is an-
other very important issue that is percolating in the Senate; that
is, the health care legislation, and Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum,
and Simon are all required to be at a meeting that is supposed to
end by 1 p.m. but may run a little beyond that. So I would say to
my friend from Utah, I don't know who is next on the list to ask
questions
   Senator HATCH. It would be Kennedy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we could proceed with Senator Thurmond,
if he wishes to, at 1 p.m., if that is appropriate.

                                                   (293)
                                      294

  Senator THURMOND. Very briefly, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then, by that time, if you aren't back, we will
just recess for a moment or move to someone else.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, are we still following the
half-hour rule?
  The CHAIRMAN. We are still following the half-hour rule.
  Senator METZENBAUM. And if any of us wish to go beyond that,
there would be a third round?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes; we will not cut off anyone as long as there
is any reasonable--and I am sure it would be in your case, Sen-
ator--reason to continue the questioning. So I have no intention of
cutting anyone off.
  Senator SIMON. You shouldn't laugh when you say that. I am
sure that we will be reasonable here.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is true. I shouldn't. It would be reasonable,
and I know that there is much to worry about when, in an op ed
piece in the Wall Street Journal, the most glowing report about any
Senator I have read in years is one about Senator Metzenbaum.
The Wall Street Journal actually put his picture in the paper, an
etching, and it was all favorable. So I know the world is changing.
I don't know what is going to come next.
  At any rate, with that, we will go into closed session.
  [The committee retired to closed session, to reconvene in open
session at 1 p.m. this same day.]

                                    AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  While we are waiting for the nominee, and he has just been told
to come in, I want to share with the press and others covering this
what our schedule is.
  In a moment, we will officially come out of our closed session,
which is now a routine part of the process. I expect we will finish
with Judge Breyer today--welcome, Judge--I do not anticipate
having any public witnesses today. It will be my intention to start
tomorrow, in the morning, and finish, I anticipate, based on the
number of witnesses, and close the hearing sometime, hopefully at
a reasonable hour, tomorrow.
  Second, in the next order of questioning, Senator Kennedy was
to question, but Senator Kennedy is involved in a matter on the
floor, although he is on his way. What I will do to keep this moving
along and accommodate everyone's schedules is in a moment yield
to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina who has some
additional second-round questions.
  The Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.
   Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, we are back with you again.

  TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN G. BREYER, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE
  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
  Judge BREYER. Yes, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. Judge, in the recent Weiss v. United States
decision, the Supreme Court stated:
                                      295

  In determining what process is due, courts must give particular deference to the
determination of Congress made under its authority to regulate the land and naval
forces.

  What is your view of the appropriate role of the judiciary in re-
viewing the terms and conditions of military service?

  Judge BREYER. In the law, the military has always had a some-
what special role, because courts have recognized the importance
of its running its own affairs, and they have recognized the impor-
tance that running their own affairs has to the well-being and the
defense of the Nation. That is well-established in law; it is widely
recognized, and I accept that widely recognized view.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, as a general matter, if two
companies believe it is in the best interest of their business to com-
bine their organizations through a merger, do you think that they
should be allowed to do so unless the Government has good reason
to prevent them from merging?

  Judge BREYER. Senator, the good reason is typically--or not al-
ways, but quite often--a question of whether the antitrust law is
violated, because the antitrust law prevents some mergers, though
it permits others. So I believe any such merger should be scruti-
nized carefully under the antitrust laws and applicable laws, and
if it passes that test, it would be permitted.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, as you may know, the Su-
preme Court held in 1922 that professional baseball was not in
interstate commerce, and therefore was not covered by the Federal
antitrust laws. When the applicability of the antitrust laws to pro-
fessional baseball was again considered in 1953 and 1972, the Su-
preme Court held that baseball is in interstate commerce, but re-
fused to apply the antitrust laws, stating that the decision to elimi-
nate the antitrust immunity should be left to the Congress.

  Do you believe that it was necessary or appropriate for the Su-
preme Court to defer to the Congress rather than take judicial ac-
tion in circumstances of this type?

  Judge BREYER. Senator, if I can depart directly, from a nonlegal
point of view, I have always thought that baseball was special, ever
since my grandfather used to take me to Seals stadium, where we
would pay 50 cents for the bleachers or $2.50 for a box seat. It
seems to me that the Supreme Court

  Senator THURMOND. NOW you pay about $20.
  Judge BREYER [continuing]. Well, they pay more, yes, that is
true--from a legal point of view, from a legal point of view, I know
there are those cases that have said in an antitrust context that
baseball is special. I know that is now being considered by Con-
gress, and I think that the courts will follow whatever Congress de-
cides in that matter.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, could you please discuss your
views on the proper scope of the extraterritorial application of our
antitrust laws--very briefly.
  Judge BREYER. Well, I am glad you said "briefly," Senator, be-
cause briefly, I know it is an enormously complex matter. There
used to be a case called Timberlane. There were conferences that
were set up with the Justice Department. They would negotiate a
variety of things. I can promise that in any case that raised that
issue before a court that I was on, I would examine it carefully, I
                                         296

would keep an open mind, and I would look into the complexity
and understand it as best I could.

  Senator THURMOND. I might say we are working with the Justice
Department now on some legislation.

  Judge Breyer, do you believe that U.S. antitrust laws should
apply equally to U.S. and foreign business, or should they seek to
favor U.S. companies compared to foreign business?

  Judge BREYER. The normal rule is when firms behave similarly,
they are treated similarly; and where firms have an adverse impact
on this country, they are treated similarly in terms of what they
intend to do and what the effect is. I would start from that as-
sumption that the law applies to both alike, but there might be
special circumstances.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Breyer, I am aware that in the past,
you have lectured on the use of legislative history and touched on
it during the hearing. Could you please summarize your current
views on the proper use of legislative history in statutory construc-
tion?

  Judge BREYER. In summary form, I have thought that there are
many instances, indeed most, where an open question in a statute
is best understood through the use of legislative history. By using
that history carefully and not abusing it, I think a court can better
understand what the human purposes are that led Congress to
enact a particular statute, and once one understands those pur-
poses, technical matters often fall into place; you understand them
better, too.

  There are instances where courts have used legislative history to
reject absurd interpretations of statutes, to find out whether there
are technical meanings, to discover whether there was some kind
of drafting error, to decide whether there are special meanings of
a statute that the parties and Senators wanted to use, to under-
stand better what the purposes were. All those are instances where
I think it is very appropriate. I recognize sometimes it can be
abused, and it should not be.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, those are all the questions I have. I
think you are an able man and a fair man, and I hope you enjoy
your career on the Supreme Court.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy is next to question. He is on
the telephone, I am told, right now; if staff would check to see if
he is ready to go. [Pause.]
  Thank you.
  We are just not accustomed to someone not using his whole time.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I
appreciate your accommodating some of those on this committee
who are also on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, who
have been meeting with the leader on some of the health issues.
  But I welcome the opportunity just to ask Judge Breyer a few
questions on your work of areas of interest to many Americans, in-
cluding the rights of persons with disabilities, and housing dis-
crimination. These have been areas that this committee has been
particularly interested in; the Americans with Disabilities Act is
something that the Committee on Labo"r and Human Resources is
very much interested in; and also the questions of crime.
                                      297
  We talked earlier about your role on the Sentencing Commission
and the importance that that truth-in-sentencing really means to
Americans and also to the integrity of the whole criminal justice
system.
  There is another area that I wanted to hear your views on, and
that is the area of bail and bail reform. You had a chance, as I
mentioned earlier, to talk about your role in the Sentencing Reform
Act of 1984. At the same time we passed that law, we also passed
the Bail Reform Act of 1984 in an effort to improve different as-
pects of the criminal justice system.
  The Bail Act, of which I was the prime sponsor, permits judges
to consider whether the defendant is dangerous in deciding wheth-
er he or she will be released or kept in custody before the trial and
to deny bail to suspects who are likely to pose a danger in the com-
munity. It also created a presumption that defendants charged
with the most serious, violent crimes, and drug crimes, are at risk
of fleeing before the trial.
  You have had several opportunities to interpret that law as a
judge, including one, the Jessup case, in which you upheld the con-
stitutionality of the law's presumption that major drug offenders
pose a danger to the community.
  So in your experience as a judge, has the Bail Reform Act helped
judges, been useful in deciding which defendants need to be de-
tained before the trial?
  Judge BREYER. In looking over the act and applying it over the
years, Senator, I recognize that the act is an effort to balance two
separate things. One is the ordinary right of the person accused of
a crime to have bail before he is actually convicted. The other is
the problem that there are some defendants who might run away,
and they really might; they will never be seen again. And there are
others who might be particularly dangerous, and if they are out on
bail, they will commit crimes.
  So I know that Congress tried to balance those two things in the
act that you sponsored. I know it created special circumstances for
dangerousness and likelihood to flee, where the person could be
kept in jail without bail. We have a set of presumptions. We inter-
preted them in the first circuit as other circuits did, and in seeing
cases come up thereafter, it seems to me that they are working rea-
sonably well--that is, it seems to me the cases where you see the
person put in prison or jail before, without bail, before trial, looking
through a record, they look like people who really might run away,
or they look like people who really are dangerous and would en-
gage in other crimes, drug crimes.
  And I have not really seen successful appeals, or many of them,
from that. So it seems to be working reasonably well on that basis.
  Senator KENNEDY. We tried to provide some additional flexibility
for the judges also, on the ability of those who might be accused,
and where there was at least some understanding and awareness
that they would be present, taking into consideration their ability
to make bail. There were a number of circumstances where people
did not have the wherewithal, even though there was not the pre-
sumption that they were dangerous or that they would flee, and
they were being held I think in a way which was an injustice, ver-
sus those who were going to flee, particularly those involved in
                                      298
drug crimes, as well as who had a repeated record of convictions
for violence against individuals. It was primarily targeted to deal
with the individuals who had a very strong and continuing record
of violence and who, on the basis of that record, presented a real
danger to the community.

  In the second area of disability, in the Wynne v. Tufts University
case, you dissented from an en bane opinion holding that a trial
was required to resolve a medical student's Rehabilitation Act
claim that Tufts University Medical School was required to alter its
testing methods to accommodate the student's learning disability.
The medical student had failed eight of the first-year courses; two
of the eight, for a second time, and one for a third time. The dis-
trict court granted summary judgment to the medical school be-
cause the student was not otherwise qualified under the Rehabili-
tation Act, since his inability to pass the multiple choice test indi-
cated that he would not be qualified to analyze complex written
materials as a physician.

  The court majority reversed, stating that there was insufficient
evidence that the medical school had considered alternative means
of evaluating the medical student's performance. You dissented, be-
cause you believed that an affidavit from the dean of the medical
school demonstrated that satisfactory performance on the multiple
choice exam was the only way to assure that the medical students
would be able to analyze complex written material that is nec-
essary for the safe and responsible practice of modern medicine.

  If the rights of persons with disabilities to have reasonable ac-
commodations made to enable them to participate in all aspects of
our society is to be meaningful, then those who are subject to the
law must make a serious inquiry to determine whether procedures
that hurt persons with disabilities can be replaced with less bur-
densome procedures.

  My question is, Will you construe the laws forbidding discrimina-
tion on the basis of disability in a manner that protects the rights
of persons with disabilities to obtain the reasonable accommodation
of their disabilities?

  Judge BREYER. The first part of my answer is that particular
case was, in my mind, an extremely close question as to the
amount of evidence. It went back, and summary judgment was
granted again; and it came back again. I do not know on those
close questions; they are very difficult.

  The answer to your second question, the second half of your an-
swer, is yes; I understand in that act, and also in more recently
legislation, that Congress has passed important laws that recognize
the importance of persons with disabilities being treated both fairly
and properly, and of people making an effort to those people who
do have disabilities. I understand that purpose, and I will interpret
those laws with that in mind.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think we have had a good deal of talk
about the Boston courthouse, but I know just from visiting with
many of the disability groups up there who visited with you, that
your sensitivity on the issues of access, availability in all parts of
that courthouse was something that was enormously impressive,
certainly to all of the people who worked with you on that.
                                      299
  There was one other case, Doe v. Anrig, that related to the reim-
bursement of tuition for private school education. As I understand,
you ruled that what was then called the Education for All Handi-
capped Children Act, which required parents be reimbursed for the
cost of educating their child in private school while their lawsuit
was pending, to force the State to provide him with an appropriate
education. Writing for the court in 1984, you upheld their right to
obtain the reimbursement, so that the act's broad purpose of assur-
ing that all children with disabilities receive an appropriate edu-
cation be preserved. I think that was certainly an important deci-
sion.
  In many respects, housing discrimination is one of the most in-
sidious forms of bigotry, since racial separation fosters the igno-
rance that perpetuates racism. I know you are familiar with the
1968 Housing Act which we passed, which was not effective, did
not have adequate remedies. We came back after the election of
1980, and in that session, we tried to pass a Fair Housing Act, and
we failed to get cloture on it by I believe it was three votes; and
then, in 1987, we passed a Fair Housing Act which prohibited dis-
crimination not only on the basis of race, but also disability, as well
as with children. There was increasing evidence of discrimination
against families in those areas.
  But now, on the issue of discrimination on the basis of race, in
NAACP v. HUD, you authored a 1987 opinion for the first circuit,
ruling that HUD has a statutory duty to enforce the Fair Housing
Act and to ensure that localities participating in Federal housing
programs eliminate discrimination. You ruled that persons ag-
grieved by HUD's failure to do so could sue the Department under
the Administrative Procedures Act to force the Department to en-
force the law.
  My question is would you describe for us how you reached the
conclusion that persons aggrieved by HUD's failure to enforce the
Fair Housing Act could go to court to obtain relief. This was prior
to the time that we took Federal action, so it was an enormously
significant and important decision, which I think in an important
way really made an important difference in terms of the need for
congressional action in this area, which subsequently followed.
  Judge BREYER. It is a decision, Senator, that really gave me
enormous satisfaction as a person and as a judge. And the reason
I felt it important both was is that you only have to look around
in this country, and you see terrible social problems of poverty and
discrimination, and no housing and no reading, and violence, and
so forth. Everyone knows the long list of terrible problems.
  Then Congress does address those matters in statutes, and in
this case, the statute had a very important purpose which I would
describe as social justice.
  Then a case arose in the court of appeals, and the district court
had thought that a series of very complicated technical doctrines
prevented the district court from carrying out that purpose in this
instance. So it was a case where I felt knowledge of the technical
part of the law helped the court and helped me analyze those tech-
nical doctrines fairly, with an idea of what they had in mind, and
enabled us, I think, to cut through the technical doctrines, to show
to the district court that they were not the obstacle that the district
                                                300

court had thought and that the technical doctrines permitted the
district court to get to the heart of the matter, which was discrimi-
nation in housing, and to create appropriate relief.

  So I felt that it was an instance where knowing the technical
doctrine, using it, understanding it, allowed the possibility of re-
moving it as an obstacle to the social justice that the basic statute
passed by Congress aimed at.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it was a recognition, it seems, in any
fair reading of that case, that it really was not the kind of remedy,
and you came up with what was a very creative, legitimate remedy
for action, which resulted in eliminating the kinds of discrimina-
tory procedures that were being followed at the time. And Congress
in the year afterward followed that precedent, and that was enor-
mously important.

  That really completes my questions. I would just like to add, Mr.
Chairman, that I think that this has been, over the period of the
past 2 days, an enormously important hearing on the qualifications
of the nominee. I think all of us on this committee, as has been
stated before, have benefited from the personal association with the
nominee for the most part--there have been new members added,
obviously--and many of us I think on this committee, and hope-
fully the American people, have been finding out what those of us
who have observed Judge Breyer as the chief judge of the first cir-
cuit--the keen intellect, the broad understanding of constitutional
issues, the kind of thoughtful judicial temperament which I think
is so important in reaching these decisions and a real awareness
and understanding of the importance of applying constitutional
principles to real life situations that affect our fellow citizens' ev-
eryday lives. I think that will be a distinguishing mark, among oth-
ers, of this nominee's service on the Supreme Court.

  Judge Breyer, I look forward to voting for you, both in this com-
mittee and on the floor of the Senate, at an early time.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  One thing on which there is no disagreement--and I do not dis-
agree with a single thing the Senator said--as I kidded you in the
closed session, thoughtful you are. I indicated, and I will say this
publicly, that I thought you were the judicial version of Paul Sar-
banes.
  Judge BREYER. That is very complimentary.
  The CHAIRMAN. The only thing that Paul does, though, is he
spends time going like this, rubbing his face, and you just sort of
give a studied pause. In both cases, you communicate what is in
fact true; both of you are very thoughtful.
  I turn to my thoughtful colleague from Maine, the poet laureate
of the Senate, Senator Cohen.
  Senator COHEN. Judge Breyer, would you explain to us the dif-
ference between affirmative action and quotas?
  Judge BREYER. NO, because I am trying to decide in the--gen-
erally speaking, I think affirmative action means you make an
enormous effort, you make a really serious effort. A quota is an ab-
solute number that you have to meet. Affirmative action means you
take this seriously and you really look. That is the general accepted
version I think in a lay person's terms.
                                      301
  Senator COHEN. In other words, if there is no numerical figure
that is either set in law or policy, then it really is not a quota, but
an affirmative action program?
  Judge BREYER. Then you are on the edge. I mean as I under-
stand it--and I am not saying how you would measure a person's
real effort--internally, internally, when a person makes an affirma-
tive action effort, it means what it says. It means you really look,
you really understand the situation. You understand that a lot of
people haven't had the opportunities that other people have had.
You think to yourself, why aren't there the persons of this race or
whatever, why.
  Remember why. Remember the history. And then taking all that
into account, remembering the history, remembering the discrimi-
nation that may exist, remembering that some people have a lot
less opportunity than others, then you go out and look and say I'm
going to find these people who may not have thought of coming,
and you really try very, very hard, and that is subjective. It might
fail, but if it does fail, you better be able to tell yourself that you
really looked very, very hard.
  A lot of that is subjective, but that is the subjective difference
that I think of in my own mind.
  Senator COHEN. If you have a situation such as the congression-
ally established policy of affirmative action programs in the ab-
sence of a change in that policy, is there any merit to a contention
on the part of an individual that he or she is equally qualified to
be admitted to a medical school, a law school, a position, and is de-
nied that opportunity based upon his or her race? Is there a con-
stitutionally protected argument here that that is a denial of equal
protection of the law?
  Judge BREYER. What has happened I think, Senator, in the af-
firmative action cases legally in the Supreme Court is that the Su-
preme Court basically has recognized two things. The first thing
that it has recognized is that there are injustices that need remedy-
ing, and those injustices stem from that long history, and the long
history before the 14th amendment and the long history after the
14th amendment, where the injustice was perpetuated.
  So they begin with the first point, which is we have to see a need
rooted in that history of past discrimination. And the second point
is, once the first point is there, once we see that need, then the pro-
gram has to be carefully tailored. Why carefully tailored? Because
it is quite clear that an affirmative action program seeking to rem-
edy past injustice can in fact adversely affect other people who
themselves did not discriminate. Of course, those people are upset
and, therefore, you can absolutely understand that.
  Now, looking into the way in which those two problems are to be
balanced, it seems to me that the Supreme Court has looked at a
number of individual factors and they have distinguished, for ex-
ample, in terms of that other third person, between taking away
from that person what he or she already have, like a job, or not
giving to that person something he or she did not ever have, like
a promotion. And while there is a problem in both cases, the second
is a little bit less harmful than the first. And they have looked at
how long the program will last, and they have looked at how tai-
                                               302

lored it is to the problem, and they have looked at is it going to
expire, is it coming along well.

  It seems to me there are a number of factors they have looked
at, as they have tried both to remedy and to balance, in order not
to work too much harm to others.

  Senator COHEN. The question I have is, if Congress were to
change the policy itself, so that there is no longer an affirmative
action policy, and yet either companies or institutions were to pur-
sue such a policy on their own or its own, is there a constitutional
argument to be made on the part of an individual who maintains
that he or she has been discriminated against based upon either
sex, gender, race, or some other factor?

  Judge BREYER. If you go beyond
  Senator COHEN. In the absence of a congressional policy is what
I am asking.
  Judge BREYER. If you go beyond those cases you know where the
Supreme Court has spelled out what is permissible in terms of
these two sets of factors, and you were to pass a law doing some-
thing like a quota, is that what you are thinking of?
  Senator COHEN. I am saying that you simply do not have an af-
firmative action program mandated by Congress.
  Judge BREYER. YOU don't have one.
  Senator COHEN. Assuming it is taken off the books.
  Judge BREYER. Assuming it is taken off the books, then there are
still cases like Weber, for example, where the Supreme Court will
permit employers to adopt these programs to remedy past discrimi-
nation. There are cases like Bakke, where the Supreme Court has
said, you know, that universities can do it. So there are cir-
cumstances, and indeed courts can as part of a remedy.
  Senator COHEN. IS there ever a statute of limitations in terms of
past injustices, or is that something the court makes a determina-
tion on as to whether the past injustices have been either rectified,
if that can be the case, or that this no longer should be a policy
to be pursued privately or by public institutions? Who determines
when the past injustice has been remedied?
  Judge BREYER. Well, if it is a court case, I suppose that there are
now standards, which I am not totally familiar with, frankly, which
the Supreme Court has tried to promulgate in a number of cases,
saying, well, it is time and the problem is over in the school area,
for example. I haven't looked at those, but if it arises in the court
case, in the court circumstance, I suppose the court, when faced
with a challenge, would look to see if this is still really necessary
or not. Suppose it has been complied with. Suppose it has been
met. I suppose that is a judgment that a court would make, but it
has to be careful.
  Senator COHEN. IS that policymaking?
  Judge BREYER. It isn't, if it is following the legal standard. But
one has to be careful.
  Senator COHEN. I know you have talked quite a bit about legisla-
tive history. I just want to go back over it for a few moments. In
your article on the uses of legislative history in interpreting stat-
utes, you say that critics maintain that it is constitutionally im-
proper to look beyond the statute's language or that searching for
congressional intent is a semimystical exercise like hunting the
                                               303

snark. Of course, Justice Scalia has been perhaps the biggest critic
of legislative intent, and you have debated him on this subject and
you are familiar with what his written statements are on the mat-
ter.

  But he has called legislative history an omnipresent make-weight
for decisions arrived at on other grounds, and referred to its use
as "the Conan Doyle approach to statutory construction." In his
view, the Court's task is not to enter the minds of the Members of
Congress who need have nothing in mind in order for their votes
to be lawful and effective. I might point out he often thinks that
we have nothing in mind, without the qualifier about being lawful
and effective, but, rather, to give fair and reasonable meaning to
the text of the United States Code.

  You point out that the problem is not with the use of legislative
history, but its abuse--care must be taken. The question I have is
that the Supreme Court recently, I believe, has ruled in cases
where legislative history has been discounted. I must say that I
have questions in my own mind as to what extent any court should
take into account what we say and how we say it.

  For example, the managers of a bill bring a measure to the floor.
We debate it openly and toward the conclusion of that debate, after
everyone has long since departed, the managers will insert col-
loquies which are not read to the other members, but are simply
inserted in the record so that many members have virtually no idea
what the colloquy is until long after the measure has been passed.

  I took this into account, because on a certain piece of legislation
I stood on the floor with some colleagues and I read the colloquies
into the record, so at least to put everyone on notice that this is
the interpretation that we were giving to this legislation.

  But in the absence of an open declaration or reading of it, I
would dare say that most members have little idea of the colloquies
that are inserted in the record as a matter of course. So I think
there is some merit to the question of challenging what Congress
intended, when something is not as clear as it ought to be on the
face of it, in the statutory language.

  I would like to ask you your opinion. Would it make a dif-
ference--perhaps on a constitutional basis--but would it make a
difference from your interpretive analysis as to whether or not this
had been widely discussed in an open forum, or simply inserted in
the record where members are not aware of it? Does it make a dif-
ference, or is it sufficient if I simply put a colloquy in the record?

  Judge BREYER. The answer in my mind is, of course, it is dif-
ferent, but that is a difference that courts should take into account,
and it doesn't make it useless.

  Suppose, for example, you, after the Senators are all thinking
about a bankruptcy law, it is easiest with a law that isn't too con-
troversial, and you all get together and all the Senators who are
working on this bill work out a set of words that is going to distin-
guish which kind of cases can be brought by consent before the
bankruptcy judge and which cases there is a right to bring before
the bankruptcy judge even without consent. That is awfully tech-
nical, and the words that describe that are pretty technical, too,
and they can refer to another case in the Supreme Court which is
filled with technicality.
                                               304

  Well, might or you might read that statute and read those tech-
nical words that everybody really agrees to as a matter of policy,
because you have thought about it as a matter of policy. Yet, one
might still scratch his head and be puzzled. And if you have de-
cided to help by putting a statement in the record, even though it
came after the debate was over, that is something a court might
look to and lawyers might look to for enlightenment, because it
might be apparent that there is no policy disagreement among you
or your colleagues about what you are trying to do. But it is impor-
tant to explain what you are trying to do.

  That is why I say it depends. If there is a huge disagreement,
beware of that later admitted statement. If it is simply a kind of
explanation, it can help guide.

  Senator COHEN. The only point I would make is that many times
members are unaware of these declarations of intent, and for the
court to rely upon those declarations of intent which are not shared
by a majority of the members and, in fact, are unknown until after
the bill is passed, I think would be a misreading of the legislative
intent.

  In that connection, you wrote an article in 1992 in Southern Cali-
fornia Law Review on legislative history and interpreting statutes,
and you point out if the history is vague or seriously conflicting,
don't use it. That was your advice. I mention this, because about
9 years earlier you decided a case, Wald v. Regan, if you are famil-
iar with that.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. YOU struck down a Treasury Department regula-
tion--I will not go into the details of it--but, in any event, you re-
lied upon legislative history in striking down that particular regu-
lation, because it didn't comply with the International Emergency
Economics Powers Act. The Supreme Court reversed you in a 5-to-
4 decision. They looked to the legislative history and came to a
completely different conclusion.
  Judge BREYER. They did.
  Senator COHEN. What is interesting about it is that the dissent
pointed out that the majority was confused about the legislative
history. So, I was wondering if the legislative history has been
thrown out by both the majority and yourself under those cir-
cumstances?
  Judge BREYER. I don't think so, actually. I understand that legis-
lative history can point in different directions and I understand it
can be complicated and confused, but I think it is worth trying. I
think it is like you do your best, you do your best. You look at it,
you try to draw information from it, you try to help understand the
human purpose. People can still disagree about it and it isn't al-
ways done properly, but I think it is worth trying.
  Senator COHEN. I would like to turn quickly to the subject of
hate crimes. We have had in 1992 more than 7,000 hate crimes re-
ported in this country, most of which were motivated by racial bias.
In 1992, the Supreme Court struck down a Minneapolis law which
imposed punishment for the display of inflammatory symbols. I
think it was RAV v. City of St. Paul. Are you familiar with that
case?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
                                               305

  Senator COHEN. The defendant had burned a cross inside the
fenced yard of a black family, and the Court held that because the
State had not criminalized all fighting words, the law isolated cer-
tain words based on their content or viewpoint and, therefore, vio-
lated the first amendment. I am not exactly clear how the Court
came to that conclusion by burning a cross inside of a black fami-
ly's fenced-in yard amounts to protected expression.

  Nonetheless, in 1993, the Court then had another case, Wiscon-
sin v. Mitchell, in which it upheld the constitutionality of a Wiscon-
sin statute that enhanced the maximum penalty for crimes that
were committed by those who intentionally selected the victim be-
cause of that victim's race, religion, color, disability, sexual orienta-
tion, national origin, or ancestry.

  I was wondering, from your perspective, because of your work on
the Sentencing Commission, do you see any difficulties in the lack
of any universally accepted definition of a hate crime or problems
in trying to determine an offender's motivation?

  Judge BREYER. What I have said on this publicly really are two
things. One is in response to your question directly. Of course, it
is difficult in instances, but there are instances where it isn't dif-
ficult. And like many matters of law in tough areas, you can say,
all right, I understand that there are difficult borderline calls, but
that doesn't mean stay away from the main thing which isn't so
difficult. So there will be some that are difficult and some that are
not. The not is not. In other words, there are many cases where
it isn't too hard to figure out.

  The other thing which you point out is, of course, from a first
amendment point of view, it is easier, if you are enhancing the pen-
alty of conduct, it is already illegal, than if you do get right into
an area where there isn't such conduct and only expression. That
thought doesn't decide cases, but, nonetheless, the actual decisions
I am sure will come up again and again. I know that RAV is a very
controversial case.

  Senator COHEN. Yesterday, you talked about the Boston court-
house. Let me come back to it for a moment. I see that Senator
Kennedy is not here, but I am sure that he is aware of the con-
troversy and has touched upon it himself. You have mentioned
that, in looking through your architecture books and perhaps
through your own empirical research, you came across one town, I
can't recall what it was now, that had the century or two-century
old structure which really became the town meeting place. I as-
sume from that that you were implying that you wanted this new
courthouse to also have that kind of attraction to the community.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. It struck me that Boston doesn't really need that
kind of an attraction to be a meeting place. If you look at the tre-
mendous development that has taken place in the city of Boston,
there are many, many places that one can go in that city, a beau-
tiful city, to attend a variety of functions. For me, somehow, the
courthouse has always remained very much a singular symbol in
our society.
  I would say, for example, if you were talking about designing a
courthouse for the Supreme Court, you would not look to see
whether or not you could make it compatible or attractive to a vari-
                                               306

ety of either enterprises or other types of activities that could take
place there. It is the place for the dispensing of justice.

  So I was curious about the impact of the past upon your thinking
for the future as far as that courthouse was concerned. And I raise
it in conjunction with matters that were brought up before the Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee, in which I and other members also
serve. What we found is that there seems to be a disparity, or at
least the GAO has found that the Federal judiciary has overesti-
mated its space needs over a 10-year period by more than 3 million
square-feet, which means that the Government may be building 1.1
billion of unneeded court space. That is what the GAO has deter-
mined.

  They have also determined that there seems to be a great dispar-
ity between the construction costs of Federal courthouses versus
those of State courthouses, almost double the amount. So it raised
questions in our minds in terms of whether we were building edi-
fices that were either unneeded, that the goal could have been
achieved in a much less expensive way, still comporting with the
needs of having a structure that would stand the test of time and
stand for future generations, as well, and that these costs were
very excessive, compared to State courts.

  I suppose you can make a case that Federal courts are more im-
portant and need to be more lasting than State courts, but I sug-
gest that State justices and judges might take great issue with
that. By the way, I might point out that the GSA, the Administra-
tive Office of the U.S. Courts, and the Congress all share respon-
sibility in this. You have to come before us, we have to give the au-
thorizations and appropriate the dollars, so it is not just picking
out the judiciary and trying to point fingers and blame.

  But it does raise questions as to why Federal courthouses cost
much more than State or local facilities. Are you aware of any ac-
tivities surrounding the selection site for the Boston courthouse
that could be considered in any way either improper, extravagant,
or unnecessary?

  Judge BREYER. NO, I think we followed all the rules.
  Senator COHEN. As you know, a lot has been made of the fact
that you have got 63 private bathrooms, 37 separate law libraries,
33 private kitchens, spiral staircases, and so forth. In your judg-
ment, those were necessary or would you consider them to be ex-
travagant?
  Judge BREYER. The bathrooms, it is a general rule that a judge
does have a bathroom in his chambers, and there are a lot of peo-
ple working there and
  Senator COHEN. How many judges in that building?
  Judge BREYER. I think there is room for somewhere close to 30,
and there is the U.S. attorney, and there are a number of others.
Whatever the normal rules were, we followed them.
  In respect to the law libraries, I feel that it is very important
that each judge has a library, and that library should be close. A
law book is to a judge what a scalpel is to a surgeon, and you don't
want the judge very far from the book, because maybe the judge
won't look into the book, and nobody wants that. So it is normal
that books are near judges, and I think that is proper.
                                               307

  The kitchens consist of a small area where a judge, at his own
expense, not government expense, can go and buy a small refrig-
erator and bring in a little microwave, which he would purchase,
in order to have lunch, say, with his clerks or the other people in
the chambers.

  Senator COHEN. What was the total cost you recall of this facil-
ity, $220 million?

  Judge BREYER. I think Senator DeConcini gave the cost yester-
day. I think it is 750,000 square-feet. It is a big building, and I
think the cost, with land purchase and everything, was around
$218 million or somewhere around there.

  Senator COHEN. I might point out that we are familiar with the
cost of expensive buildings. You are in one right now. As a matter
of fact, when it was first built, it was I believe the most expensive
building in the city of Washington at that time, the Hart Building.

  As a matter of fact, most Senators were reluctant to move into
this building, and by congressional fiat, the Senate leadership or-
dered the younger members to vacate the premises that they were
then occupying and move in here, because the senior members
were unwilling to take the public reaction to the costs of this Taj
Mahal.

  The CHAIRMAN. I want the record to show that my office is not
in this building. [Laughter.]

  Senator COHEN. YOU were then a senior member at the time.
  Just a couple of more questions, Judge. I want to go back to the
book that you wrote that Senator Biden had on his desk yesterday,
called "Breaking the Vicious Cycle." In the books, you talked about
the vicious cycle of public demand and said that the excessive regu-
latory response is the product of several factors that work in tan-
dem. At the root is an ill-informed public, with skewed perceptions
of the risk, fed by unsystematic media reports, a distrust of ex-
perts, and low levels of mathematical understanding. I believe I
have summarized your basic analysis of this vicious cycle that you
have talked about.
  You point out that Congress is susceptible to public concerns; it
contributes to the distortions of priorities. The public fears are
picked up and translated into policy by a Congress that does not
have the institutional resources to resist draconian legislation es-
tablishing rigid objectives with little room for adjusting priorities
within limited budgets or balancing costs against benefits.
  Then you go from Congress to the regulators, who compound the
problem, as bureaucrats respond with overly conservative assump-
tions in order to forestall charges of inattention or neglect, and the
regulators also aim their rules narrowly to deal with one problem
while worsening another. For example, proposed rules concerning
disposal of sewage sludge designed to save one statistical life every
5 years would encourage waste incineration likely to cause two sta-
tistical cancer deaths annually.
  What you recommend, as I recall, in this particular book is to
create a small, centralized administrative unit within the executive
branch, with a mandate to rationalize risk policies across agencies.
Critics have pointed to that and suggested that it is unrealistic in
the United States of America to establish a sort of platonic admin-
istrative group of wise men, circle of wise men, who would in fact
                                               308

be an elite, top-down policy coordination group, that would be un-
thinkable in a society that prizes open debate, diversity of opinion,
and easy access to Government.

  In other words, they suggest, this is a proposal that might work
well in Singapore, but not a Seattle, or indeed, a Washington, DC.

  How do you respond to that?
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator. The response is three. The
first is you put in half, I think, when you say too far; and the other
half is too little. The problem that the book is aimed at is spending
a lot of money over here to save a statistical life that may not even
exist, at the same time that there are women with breast cancer
who would live, but who do not because they cannot afford or find
the place for the mammograms; and there are children who do not
have the vaccines that will save them from death for a lot of dis-
eases. And I think there are two pages in that book that summa-
rize, one sentence after another, all those things that might be
done but that are not done.
  So the book is a plea--though it is put in technical terms--it is
put in a plea not to cut back by 1 penny this Nation's commitment
to health, safety, and the environment. But please, let us think
about the possibility of reorganizing that commitment so that there
are fewer women and children who are dying of things they really
will die of because the money was not there, when there are mon-
eys being spent on the statistical life that might not exist. That is
the first point.
  The second point is there is a plan there for reorganization. The
point about the reorganization is not really to create a new bu-
reaucracy that will take power from the people. Rather, the people
have delegated already to the bureaucracy power to do particular
things. And there, it seems to me wise, or at least I suggest it, that
the people who are already there--in, let us say, parts of the Office
of Management and Budget--not be trained solely as cost-cutters,
not be trained solely as people who do policy analysis, but perhaps
take on a career where they learn what really goes on at EPA for
part of their career; where they come over to Congress and work
for a while and learn something about that; where they go out into
the field and maybe learn what people are really thinking, and
then come back and have, with that experience, more ability to
transfer resources from one program to another that a pure cost-
cutter might lack.
  And the third problem, which is a real problem for democracy
and is a tremendous problem for you and a tremendous problem for
me, is I think I have a guess of what people want in that area, and
may guess is that what they want is more life saved. And my guess
is that is what you want, too.
  So a lot of what I have written about in that book is should stat-
utes try to do that, or should they go into such detail as dioxin-
FO20 to the 14th degree in three molecules, et cetera. That is the
problem of delegation. That is the question of what level of specific-
ity do you delegate.
  I absolutely think that people want more safety, and that is the
basic power that should be delegated. I think it becomes very, very,
very difficult to expect people to become experts on risk analysis,
or how many molecules there ought to be in what kind of sub-
                                      309

stance. And that is the kind of concern that I am worried about
that leads me to think there are ways of organizing the bureauc-
racy better to save more human life, with the same commitment
of resource that we now have.

  Senator COHEN. But you say the root of it is an ill-informed pub-
lic with skewed perceptions of risk

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. Fed by systematic media reports
and a distrust of the experts.
  Judge BREYER. Right.
  Senator COHEN. HOW do you propose to break that--and
compounded by Congress, which is also contributing to the distor-
tions of priorities--how do you break that cycle by having the small
group of experts in the field, or in OMB or some of the other agen-
cies, who will then do what--better inform the public? Better in-
form Congress?
  Judge BREYER. And this, you might say is Utopian, I know. But
you realize what it is I think the public is informed about. I do not
think they are not informed about what they want. I do not think
they are not informed about there being a problem. I think they do
know what they want, and I think the public does know that there
is a problem. And I think they are right.
  What is very hard to get public consensus about is the right
number of molecules, or the right chemical substance exactly
where. That is the problem of information. And what is perhaps a
little Utopian, I would call the biggest problem that I find from a
policy point of view--the problem of building trust in the Govern-
ment. And my suggestion there has been a little bit like this: Sup-
pose the President of the United States--this is what I have said
before--had somewhat broader authority to take money or re-
sources from one program and to move it to another, and that he
was under a mandate to meet the following condition--come back
and prove to us that in doing so, you have saved more human life.
And suppose that began to be done. Then, you might gradually--
you might gradually--build public trust in that kind of circulating
career path where people come to Congress and EPA and OMB and
create this institution, and people in the country begin to under-
stand that more life is being saved, a little at a time. You might
gradually build some confidence in that institution, hard though it
is to break into a mode of public trust. And if you could do that,
you would end up saving more life, and that is the thrust of the
book.
  Senator COHEN. I think that sort of outcomes analysis is prob-
ably unrealistic in view of the life cycle of any President of this
country; that by the time one were able to demonstrate that, then
he or she would certainly long be out of office. So I am not sure
that is going to be a practical solution.
  I see my time is up, and I appreciate your answers, Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I hope that was spoken as a political sci-
entist
  Judge BREYER. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. And not as a judge
  Judge BREYER. Absolutely.
                                      310
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Because we make those judgments
every day. The American people have no doubt that more people
die from coal dust than from nuclear reactors, but they fear the
prospect of a nuclear reactor more than they do the empirical data
that would suggest that more people die from coal dust, from hav-
ing coal-fired burners.
  They also know that more lives would be saved if we took that
25 percent we spend in the intensive care units in the last few
months of the elderly's lives, that more children would be saved.
But part of our culture is that we have concluded as a culture that
we are going to, rightly or wrongly, we are going to spend the
money, costing more lives, on the elderly. We made that judgment.
  I think it is incredibly presumptuous and elitist for political sci-
entists to conclude that the American people's cultural values in
fact are not ones that lend themselves to a cost-benefit analysis
and to presume that they would change their cultural values if in
fact they were aware of the cost-benefit analysis.
  I have no doubt that more people know that more people die of
cigarettes than they do of other substances, but they have con-
cluded they would rather have the money spent on research in
other areas. We make those decisions every day, and I am de-
lighted that as a judge, you are not going to be able to take your
policy prescriptions into the Court.
  I yield to Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, I would like to ask you a few questions about your
decision in the Ottati case. As I understand the Ottati case, you
upheld a ruling that allowed a company responsible for polluting
43 acres in Kingston, NH, to clean up that site about one-tenth as
much as EPA determined was necessary to protect Kingston's resi-
dents from 439 cases of cancer over their lifetimes.
  I do not want to question you about the merits of your decision
in that case. What concerns me, however, Judge, is that you de-
cided a case that reduces polluters' and their insurance companies'
liability for cleaning up hazardous waste at a time when your in-
vestment at Lloyd's of London included environmental liability in-
surance policies.
  In retrospect, Judge, do you feel that possibly you should have
recused yourself from hearing that case?
  Judge BREYER. Senator, I looked at this very carefully. There
was no party that I had invested in in the case. It had been fully
disclosed. The issue to me, and I think the issue under the canons,
is whether there would flow from that investment a substantial ef-
fect on my investment from that decision in that case. That is not
a speculative effect, it is not a remote effect, it is not a contingent
effect. It is a real, substantial effect. And having looked at that
case before and looked at it again, it seems to me that it was cor-
rect under the canons that I could sit in that case. I do think that,
though I understand in fact the various problems you have raised.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I know that there are some who
think that it was proper under the canons; there are some who dis-
agree. Justice Scalia--whom I did not think I would ever be
quoting in connection with the law--but he says that 455(a) covers
all forms of partiality and requires them all to be evaluated on an
                                      311
objective basis so that what matters is not the reality of partiality,
but its appearance.

  He goes on to say: "Quite simply and quite universally, recusal
was required whenever impartiality might reasonably be ques-
tioned." He is not addressing himself to this matter as such, but
that is a quote from him.

  Now, in your response to Judge Heflin, you acknowledged that,
as Professor Hazard said, it was possibly imprudent for you as a
Federal judge to invest in Lloyd's. Isn't the corollary of that reason-
ing that it was possibly imprudent for you to decide the Ottati case
since your Lloyd's syndicates included environmental pollution li-
ability?

  Judge BREYER. What he said was imprudent, Senator, he be-
lieves that it is ethical, that no ethical canon was violated, and he
is concerned--and I have since read this--whether or not it is pru-
dent for a judge to have an investment in an insurance company.
And haying listened to your concerns, which I realize were in very
good faith and were very, very important to address thoroughly, I
have come to the conclusion that it would be best not to have such
an investment, and that is a matter of prudence; it is not a matter
of ethics. But having listened to that, that is how I feel about it.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Having said that it would probably be
prudent not to have such an investment, isn't the corollary of that
equally true, and that is that were similar matters to come before
you in the future, matters that might have some impact upon your
Lloyd's investment, would it not be prudent in those cases to recuse
yourself from hearing those cases?

  Judge BREYER. I think that I must have a very, very careful sys-
tem to achieve the very objective you are announcing and enunciat-
ing and I have listened to. What I think that system is is that it
must be absolutely disclosed fully, in whatever court I am in, just
what that investment is, and indeed, the parties have to be di-
rected, their attention directed to it, and the parties have to be able
to--anonymously, so I do not know which party--either orally or in
writing, point out how there might be a real impact on that invest-
ment from a holding in the case. And then I think that must be
communicated to me in a way that I do not know which party
raised the issue, and I must evaluate that with great care and
then, having done so, if I come to the conclusion that there would
be a direct, a real impact on my investment, then I recuse myself.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I think you said a direct, real impact.
What we are talking about in the Ottati case is not a question of
whether or not your investment in Lloyd's was being affected by
your judgment in the Ottati case, but whether or not your judg-
ment in the Ottati case might set precedents, might set certain
standards in the law

  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator METZENBAUM [continuing]. That could affect your invest-
ment.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator METZENBAUM. There is no question Lloyd's was not on
the Ottati liability. Now, as a matter of fact, environmental law ex-
perts tell me that as a practical matter, the Ottati case does make
it more difficult for EPA to pressure polluters into speedy hazard-

     85-742 - 95 - 11
                                         312

ous waste removal under stringent cleanup standards; second, it
reduces EPA's ability to clean up more hazardous waste sites be-
cause EPA must use its own limited resources to clean up these
sites, rather than making the polluters clean them up immediately;
and it allows the district courts to weaken EPA's cleanup require-
ments to one-tenth--one-tenth--of EPA's standard when the agen-
cy seeks a preliminary injunction.

  Is that not the practical effect of your decision in Ottati?
  Judge BREYER. The question, from my point of view, is was there
a real, direct impact on the investment. And I think the question
of whether there is a real, direct impact on the investment by those
who have looked at it--the answer is no. And I think that what I
would like to do in the future is to look to see, after having been
advised by the parties or anyone who wants to, is there a real im-
pact on the investment from the holding in the case.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, it should be pointed out that Ottati
did have a direct and predictable effect on pollution insurance, par-
ticularly like Merritt 418, which was your investment, because all
polluters and their insurers stand to benefit from that ruling, by
less hazardous waste cleanup and weaker cleanup standards. So I
think that the Ottati case is relevant to your investment, but indi-
rectly, not directly, and to what extent, neither you nor I know.
  Would you agree with that?
  Judge BREYER. If I thought there were a substantial, that is, a
direct, effect, I would have taken myself out, and that would be the
correct thing to do. If, judgmentally, I think that the effect is re-
mote or speculative or contingent, then I think the thing to do is
to sit. And in making my judgment on that case, I concluded that
any effect on my investment was remote or speculative or contin-
gent, not substantial, not direct.
  I think that was a correct judgment. What I am trying to do is,
in the future, make certain that I am fully informed so I can make
similar judgments with complete information, with the parties fully
understanding the problems, the likelihoods.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield on Ottati? I am con-
fused. Since I asked about the case, Judge, I thought the facts in
Ottati were that the EPA chose a procedural route that allowed the
district court judge to make a judgment that the judge otherwise
would not have been able to make had the EPA proceeded and at-
tempted to enforce its own judgment. Is that correct?
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. What I am confused about is how does that affect
any insurance case, on anybody. I am confused about that.
  Judge BREYER. I could not find a way. I think it does not. I think
it does not. And I suppose there are people who have thought of
some way, but I think any way people might think of would be
speculative. I personally cannot think of a real way.
  The CHAIRMAN. If you had ruled--if the EPA had gone directly
to the district court judge under a different procedure, and the dis-
trict court judge substituted his or her judgment as to what was
sufficient under the statute for EPA, then I can understand how
it could be argued that you have changed the rules of the game and
put district court judges, who could be more or less stringent than
EPA, in the driver's seat. But that was not the case, was it?
                                      313

  I thank the Senator for allowing me to yield, because I am con-
fiised about this.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I would just say that I do not think
I want to debate the substance of the Ottati case with my friend,
the chairman, and I will ask him to give me additional time by rea-
son of the interruption.

  But the fact is under the conclusion you reached, it was nec-
essary for the EPA to go back to get a final order, which could take
an additional 2, 3, 4, 5 years, which would be very costly to EPA,
and in the interim, fewer waste sites would be cleaned up, and
there would be less cleanup as a result of Ottati. As a matter of
fact, in the Ottati case, you say additional cleanup will cost an
added several million dollars, and then you say:

  International Mineral and Chemical has already spent about $2.6 million, all for
very little purpose, since 1 part per million is not significantly safer than 5 or 10.

  That is your language.
  Just prior to that statement, you note:

  Evidence suggests that a one part per million standard would reduce the risk of
439 human cancers from lifetime exposure to about one in a million.

  You then stated that

  Allowing 10 times more contamination would lead to 10 times as many cases of
cancer.

  How could you conclude that by allowing 10 times more pollu-
tion, that causes 10 times more cancers, you are making the envi-
ronment significantly safer? I have trouble following that, and I
have to say that with respect to the chairman's inquiry on the
question of when the decision is made, following your order, there
was to be something like a 2-, 3-, 5-year delay, at substantially ad-
ditional cost to the EPA, and I do not think any of the EPA lawyers
or the EPA questions the fact that your decision was a major set-
back to their efforts.

  Judge BREYER. I did not see it that way, Senator. I thought that
the case involved fact-related matters growing out of a particular
waste dump, and I think those fact-related matters were viewed
under the standard of whether the district court was clearly erro-
neous.

  It is very difficult for an appellant to get an appeals court with
a 40,000-page record on a fact-related matter to achieve a reversal
under a clearly erroneous standard. EPA did, indeed, achieve such
a reversal on one of the matters before us. We decided in favor of
the EPA on one of those fact-related points, and we decided on the
other fact-related points that the district court's decision was not
clearly erroneous.

  That is basically, in my mind, what was at issue in that case in
the area you are talking about.

  Senator METZENBAUM. That case, I think, had been dragged out
for about 10 years up until the time it got to you.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I think you added maybe another 5 years
to the matter of getting the matter resolved. And I think that does
help the defendants in those cases, the polluters, and it certainly
does not help the EPA. But let me proceed.
                                      314

  I do not know if you realize that the polluters' own experts ad-
mitted that their cleanup fell far short of their own proposed le-
nient standards. As a matter of fact, the records before you show
that up to 280 times more contamination was involved than EPA
considered safe or 28 times more contamination than even the pol-
luter acknowledged would be dangerous.

  My question is: In view of that additional exposure and risk, why
did you disregard the data on the need for more thorough hazard-
ous waste cleanup?

  Judge BREYER. On the issue of volatile organic compounds, one
of the fact-related issues, after reading through many thousands of
pages, we all came to the conclusion that the district court was
wrong, and we supported EPA and sent it back for more thorough
cleanup on that point. On the other fact-related points, we decided
there was enough evidence to support the district court.

  Quite honestly, when I finished, I thought maybe EPA has won
on this aspect of the case, because it is very difficult to achieve a
reversal on that fact-related type of issue. It won some, the impor-
tant one of VOC. It lost others. I thought the whole matter is fact-
related, fact-specific. I went through it conscientiously, reading
thousands of pages of records. And on the basis of those thousands
of pages, I came and my colleagues came to the fact-related conclu-
sions that we wrote in the opinion.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, in a recent book, you express actu-
ally pretty much disdain for EPA's approach to cleaning up the en-
vironment. In Ottati, when you say,

  The site was mostly cleaned up. All but one of the private parties had settled.
The remaining private party litigated the cost of cleaning up the last little bit, a
cost of about $9.3 million. How much extra safety did the $9.3 million buy?

  That is your language.

  Without the extra expenditure, the waste dump was clean enough for children
playing on the site to eat small amounts of dirt, but there were no dirt-eating chil-
dren playing in the area, for it was a swamp.

  Judge Breyer, I think in that situation you were not actually cor-
rect. TTie record before the district court indicates that the land in
dispute in Ottati was not a swamp, but the land in dispute was
zoned residential. And the record shows the land is partially sur-
rounded by a residential neighborhood where children play, and,
therefore, the children did have an exposure. It was not just a
swamp.

  But let me go on to
  Senator KENNEDY. Are you going to let him answer? Do you want
to answer?
  Judge BREYER. From my appearance of reading the records, Sen-
ator, the area was the way I described it, and there was--but the
point that I want to make is what I have written in the book and
the decision in the case are two totally separate things. I have gone
in my mind, thinking that case is decided as a judge. It is decided,
recognizing as I wrote that when the EPA decides something in an
administrative context rather than coming into a case in court, all
presumptions are for the EPA. It did appear in a book written on
a policy basis, having nothing to do with my role as a judge, point-
ing out a variety of things that I have tried to point out, for other
                                      315
people--environmentalists and many others--to read and to accept
or to reject as they wish.

  My object, purely as a person who is interested in public policy,
was to write matters down so that other people could consider
them, question them, criticize them, say they are absolutely wrong.
That is fine with me. I like that. I think that is important to get
that kind of criticism as a policymaker, and, indeed, to get it as a
judge as well.

  But I want to be very, very clear that that book does not have
to do with my role as a judge.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I hope the Chair will continue to allow me
additional time for questions that are not mine.

  Judge, the Ottati case becomes very relevant because you were
a major investor in Lloyd's. I have recently come to know an invest-
ment in Lloyd's is unusual. A Lloyd's investor puts up only a very
small deposit, and the investor's real investment is his or her per-
sonal guarantee.

  If the syndicate loses money, the investor's personal assets pay
the losses. It makes investing in Lloyd's very, very risky. A Lloyd's
investor can be wiped out, lose everything right down to his home,
his car, his total assets. A Lloyd's investment is totally different
than a purchase of stock, whether in a mutual fund or an insur-
ance company or any other kind of business investment.

  So your decisions having to do with Ottati and seven other envi-
ronmental cases is particularly relevant to our hearing, because
you have had and continue to have a very substantial exposure to
Lloyd's.

  Now, do you have any disagreement with the description that I
gave of Lloyd's investors?

  Judge BREYER. I do, rather. That is to say, I do not know if you
are speaking theoretically or practically.

  When I went into Lloyd's, I viewed it as a very conservative in-
vestment in which, in fact, you are exposed to insurance companies
that sell and insure and buy anything in the world. And all these
things over time, whether there are earthquakes in Japan or
whether there are tidal waves or whether there is maritime losses
or these kind of loses--there can be losses in everything, anything.
You never know what your own syndicate may be winning, may be
losing, whatever it is. It is done in a conservative way so that
whether a particular case there is a loss or does not balances out
somewhere else, and you do not know.

  Now, as a practical matter and as a theoretical matter, as a prac-
tical matter I believed and I still believe that my risks and benefits
would consist of several thousand dollars in income each year, and
sometimes several thousand dollars--by that I mean under $10,000
or $12,000 certainly, possibly having to write a check. There was
a deposit at Lloyd's that possibly was meant for the worst case that
went up to about $150,000.

  Theoretically--theoretically--if worse had come to worse, and it
was stressed to me at the time that over 300 years in conservative
syndicates, worse did not come to worse. But if worse came to
worse, luckily because I am in a very fortunate economic situation,
about 20 percent to 25 percent of our family assets would have
been lost. That is the worse, theoretically, coming to worse.
                                      316
  Senator METZENBAUM. And that would have been about how
much money?
  Judge BREYER. It would have been an awful lot of money. It de-
pended on the year. It depended on the year.
  Senator METZENBAUM. We are talking about something in excess
of
  Judge BREYER. We are talking about several hundred thousand
dollars.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Or maybe $1 million.
  Judge BREYER. I do not think it could have gone that high, but
it is possible.
  Senator METZENBAUM. But neither you nor I nor any of us know
what the loss will be in connection with this one particular syn-
dicate you went into, which was 418, which had exposures in as-
bestos where you have already recused yourself in those cases, and
also had pollution exposures. And it seems to be arguable as to ex-
actly how much the risk could be, but everyone seems to agree that
Merritt 418 was probably one of the worst of the Lloyd's of London
exposures or syndicates.
  Judge BREYER. Senator, what I do if I have a lot of money at
stake or if I have a little money at stake, if there is a big invest-
ment or if there is a small investment, it is the same question. The
question is: Look at those cases, see if there is anyone from the in-
vestment that is a party in that case. If so, you are out of it. If not,
look again. Look again at that case to see if the decision in that
case could substantially affect your pocketbook. If so, you are out
of it. If not, fine.
  I apply that test with alarm bells to whatever investment I have,
big or small. And in that case, no alarm bell went off, and the rea-
son that no alarm bell went off is I thought judgmentally that
there was no substantial effect on a small investment, on a big in-
vestment, on a medium-sized investment, on any investment. And
I think that that conclusion has been verified by others.
  Senator METZENBAUM. In retrospect. You are saying it has been
verified by others. You mean that the White House asked some
ethics professors for their opinion, and one said it was imprudent,
others said that it was entirely proper, and some other professors
apparently have said it was totally inappropriate.
  Judge BREYER. What I must do as a judge is I must make up my
own mind on a case-by-case basis whether there is a substantial
impact or whether there is not.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Would the Senator yield on that
point? I think we ought to put into the record, at this point in the
record, exactly what those letters contained. And I dare say they
are not as described by the Senator from Ohio. I think in fairness
to this nominee we ought to put into the record what those legal
scholars and ethicists that have been called on by this committee
under Republicans and Democrats alike and who are some of the
most distinguished, thoughtful, and profound individuals that write
on this subject matter. We will just put that in the record. I think
that is what is important, rather than characterizations about
some
  Senator HATCH. And all but one found .in your favor and said
there was nothing unethical.
                                      317

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, as a matter of fact
  Senator HATCH. Let's get with it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I did not think that I was in a debate
with my colleagues on this committee.
  Senator KENNEDY. We want an accurate statement of what has
been characterized in the record.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, the fact is I have no problem about
putting it in the record. Also put into the record the indication by
Professor Hazard that the matter of hearing the case was impru-
dent. Also put in the fact, I believe, that there is a letter coming
from a Professor Freedman, who teaches ethics at Hofstra, in
which he comes to the conclusion, as I am informed, that it was
inappropriate and was unethical. But I want to make it clear here.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, he did not say it was imprudent.
  Senator HATCH. NO, he did not say that.
  Senator KENNEDY. That is what we are getting at. He did not say
it was imprudent. He said because a potential for possible conflict
of interest, a possible appearance of impropriety, in light of the
facts, no conflict of interest or appearance of conflict materialized.
And I do not think it is fair to go on and mischaracterize it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. What does he say about the word impru-
dent?
  Senator KENNEDY. I have put it in the record, Senator.

  You have asked for my opinion whether Judge Breyer has committed a violation
of judicial ethics in investing in Lloyd's name and insurance underwriting while
being a Federal judge. In my opinion, there was no violation of judicial ethics. In
my view, it was possibly imprudent for a person who is a judge to have such an
investment because of the potential for possible conflict of interest and because of
possible appearance. However, in light of the facts, no conflict of interest or appear-
ance of conflict materialized.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I have no objection putting that in.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is different from what was stated.
  Senator HATCH. It certainly was.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I want to ask the Chair also, there is a
letter coming from Professor Freedman, who indicates, as I under-
stand it, that he considers it was unethical. But I want to make
it clear: I am not challenging the ethical propriety of your conduct
because I believe you conducted yourself in a manner that you con-
sidered to be ethical and still do.
  I am concerned about what happens tomorrow when cases come
before you, and I think we are entitled to your view on that, Judge
Breyer.

Lloyd Cutler, Esq.
Counsel to ths President
Mhlte Mouse Counsel's Office
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. Cutler:

         you have asked ·· to answer the following question: Did
Judge Stephen Breyer violate section 4S5 of title 2S of the
United States Code ("$455") by sitting on eight cases involving
CERCLA when he was a "name" in a Lloyd's of London syndicate that
insured against environmental pollution among other risks?

         I have been asked to assume (a) that Judge Breyer did not
know and could not have known the identities of the syndicate's
insureds or the terms of their policies; (b) that Judge Breyer
did know or could have known that environmental pollution was one
of the risks against which the syndicate insured; and (c) that
Judge Breyer was exposed to a possible loss of 25,000 pounds, had
insurance against additional loss of up $188,000, and that
reasonable estimates are that his actual loss will not exceed the
insurance coverage though they cculd.

         In answering your question, I am going to disregard the
assumption in (c) and assume instead that at the time Judge
Breyer sat on the eight CERCLA cases he had at least 25,000 of
financial exposure and possibly more.

         I have reviewed the eight CERCLA cases. In my opinion, Judge
Breyor did not violate $455.

         A judge may not sit in a case in which the judge or certain
family members have a "financial intereet, however small" in a
"party" or in the "subject matter in controversy." $455(b)(4),
 (d)(4). Judge Breyer had no financial interest in the parties to
the CERCIA case nor in their subject matter. An example of the
latter would be a judge's stock ownership in a company that,
though not a party to a proceeding, was the subject of control
between the actual parties.

         Where the judge has an intereet other than a "financial
 interest" in a party or in the subject matter in controversy,
different rules apply. The judge is not then disqualified
"however small" his or her interest. The size of the judge's
"other interest" then matters: It must be "substantial1}."
S455(b)(4).

         This difference recognizes two truths: the public is less
likely to suspect a judge's impartiality when the judge's
interest is other than in a party or the subject matter in
controversy; and if any "other interest," even insubstantial
ones, could disqualify judges, the scope of disqualification
would be too broad with no public gain. ";W)han an interest is
not direct, but is remote, contingent, or speculative, it is not
                                319

the kind of interest which reasonably brings into question a
judge's impartiality." in re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.. 861
F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir. 1988)(construing S4S5(a), discussed
below).

        Section 455(b)4) and (b)(5)(ill) recognize the different
policies when a judge's interest is not in a "party" or in the
"subject natter in controversy." These provisions require recusal
only when the judge (or certain family members) have "any other
interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of
the proceeding." $455(b){4).

         This different standard has two distinguishing elements.
First, the effect on the judge's interest must be substantial.
Second, the word "could" has been repeatedly construed to require
that the effect of "the outcome of the proceeding" on the judge's
interest must be not be "indirect" or "speculative." in re Placid
O H co.. 802 F.2d 783, 786-77 (5th Cir. 1986). Construing
S455(b)(4) in Placid Oil, the Court wrote: "A remote, contingent,
and speculative interest is not a financial interest within the
meaning of the recusal statute... nor does it create a situation
in which a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned."
Id. at 787.

         The Court's last reference, to "impartiality," brings us to
S455(a), which requires recusal when a judge's "impartiality
might reasonably be questioned." While $455(a) and $455(b)
overlap, they are not congruent. Llteky v. United states. 114
S.Ct. 1147 (1994). Nevertheless, here, I reach the sane
conclusion under both provisions.

         Placid Oil is an instructive case. It was brought against 23
banks, seeking recision of credit agreements and other relief
 "based on a number of alleged wrongful acts of the Banks." Id. at
786. Plaintiffs sought recusal of the district judge, who was
 alleged to have "a large investment in a Texas bank that may be
affected by rulings in this case." Plaintiffs argued that "any
rulings adverse to the Banks will have a dramatic impact on the
entire banking industry and thus on [the judge's] investment as
well," thereby giving the judge a "financial interest in the
 litigation." Id. The Circuit rejected the recusal effort:

                 We find no basis here for requiring recusal. We are
                  unwilling to adopt a rule requiring recusal in every
                  case in which a judge owns stock .of a company in the
                  sane industry as one of the parties to the case.... id.

This position was followed in Gas Otllitiea go. of Alabama, inc.
     Southern natural Gas Co.. 996 F.2d 282 (11th Cir. 1993), cart.
     i d 114 S.Ct. 687 (1994).

         I see no evidence that the decisions in Judge Breyer's
CERCLA cases "could" have a direct and substantial effect on his
 interest in a syndicate that has insured against the risk of
 liability for environmental pollution, without parsing every case
here, I found their holdings to be relatively narrow, some quite
 limited. For most of the cases, it would be impossible to say how
the holding could affect Judge Breyer's own interests or those of
the syndicate in which he invested. For all of the cases, the
Judge's interest is "not direct, but is remote, contingent, or
speculative." In re Drexel Burnham Lambert, supra at 1313.

         Given the twin requirements of substantiality and the
caselaw definition of "could" as used in $455(b), Judge Breyer
did not have to recuse himself in the eight CERCLA cases. He did
not violate S455.

              Re: Judge Stephen Brever

Dear Mr. Cutler:
       Your have asked for my opinion whether Judge Stephen Breyer

committed a violation ofjudicial ethics in investing as a "Lloyd's Name" in
insurance underwriting while being a federal judge. In my opinion there was
no violation ofjudicial ethics. In my view it was possibly imprudent for a
person who is a judge to have such an investment, because of the potential
for possible conflict of interest and because of possible appearance of
impropriety. However, in light of the facts no conflict of interest or
appearance of conflict materialized. I understand that Judge Breyer has
divested from the investment so far as now can be done and will completely
terminate it when possible.

       1. I am Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania, and
Sterling Professor of Law Emeritus, Yale University. I am also Director of
the American Law Institute. I have been admitted to practice law since 1954
and am a member of the bar of Connecticut and California. I am engaged in
an active consulting practice, primarily in the fields of legal and judicial
ethics, and have given opinions both favorable and unfavorable to lawyers
and judges. I was Consultant and draftsman for the American Bar
Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct promulgated in 1972, on which
the rules of ethics governing federal judges are based. I have also been
Reporter and draftsman of the American Bar Association Model Rules of
Professional Conduct, promulgated in 1983, and before that consultant to
the project for the ABA Model Conduct of Professional Responsibility. I am
author of several books and many articles on legal and judicial ethics and
write a monthly column on the subject.

       2. I am advised that Judge Breyer made an investment as a
"Lloyd's Name" some time in 1978. He has since terminated that investment
except for one underwriting, Merrett 418, that remains open. He intends to
terminate that commitment as soon as legally permitted. I have further
                                         321

assumed the accuracy of the description of a Lloyd's Name investment set
forth in the memorandum of July 3, 1994, by Godfrey Hodgson. My previous
understanding of the operation of Lloyd's insurance, although less specific
than set forth in the memorandum, corresponds to that description.

       3. I have assumed the following additional facts:

                                              Uki/
       (a) As a "Name" Judge Breyer/Sot have, and could not have had,
knowledge of the particular coverages underwritten by the Merrett 418
syndicate. It would have been possible for a Name to discover through
inquiry that environmental pollution as a category was one of the risks
underwritten by the syndicate.

       (b) Judge Breyer had "stop-loss" insurance against bis exposure as a
Name, up to $188,000 beyond an initial loss of 25,000 pounds. This is in
substance reinsurance from a third source against the risk of actual
liability.

       (c) A reasonable estimate of the potential loss for Judge Breyer is
approximately $114,000, well within the insurance coverage described above.
However, there is a theoretical possibility that his losses could exceed that
estimate.

       (d) The Merrett 418 syndicate normally would have closed at the
end of 1987. It remains open because of outstanding liabilities to the
syndicate that were not later adopted by other syndicates. These
outstanding liabilities include environmental pollution and asbestos liability.

       4. I am advised that Judge Breyer as judge participated in a
number of cases that one way or another involved the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
commonly known as the Superfund statute. None of these cases involved
Lloyd's as a party or by name in any respect. None appear to have involved
issues that would have material or predicable impact on general legal
obligations under the Superfund legislation. Most of the cases are fact-
specific and all involve secondary or procedural issues. I have assumed that
the description of these cases in the attached list is fair and accurate.

       5. In my opinion, Judge Breyer's participation in the foregoing
cases did not entail a violation ofjudicial ethics. None of the cases involved
Lloyd's as a party or as having an interest disclosed in the litigation. None
could have had a material effect on Judge Breyer's financial interests. None
had a connection direct enough with Judge Breyer as to create a basis on
which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as that term is used
in Section 455 and in the Code of Judicial Ethics.

       6. There is a close analogy between the kind of investment as a
Name and an investment in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is an investment
that holds the securities of operating business enterprises. Ownership in a
mutual fund is specifically excluded as a basis for imputed bias under
Section 455 and the Code of Judicial Ethics. This exclusion was provided
deliberately, in order to permit judges to have investments that could avoid
the inflation risk inherent in owning Government bonds and other fixed
                                         322

income securities but without entailing direct ownership in business
enterprises. A Names investment is similarly an undertaking in a venture
that in turn invests in the risks attending business enterprise. Just as
ownership in a mutual fund is not ownership in the securities held by the
fund, so, in my opinion, is investment as a Name not an assumption of
direct involvement in the risks covered by the particular Lloyd's syndicate.

       7. In my opinion it could be regarded as imprudent for a judge to
invest as a Lloyd's Name, notwithstanding that no violation ofjudicial ethics
is involved. The business of insurance is complex, sometimes controversial,
and widely the subject of public concern and suspicion. The insurance
industry is highly regulated and insurance company liability often entails
issues of public importance. In my opinion it was therefore appropriate for
Judge Breyer to have withdrawn from that kind of investment so far as he
could legally do so, simply to avoid any question about the matter. That
said, I see nothing in his conduct that involves ethical impropriety.

                                                      ly yours,

                JUDGE BREYER'S "CERCLA" (8UPERFUHD STATUTE) CASES

          Judge Breyer has participated in eight cases involving the
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
 Act (CERCLA), the Superfund statute. None involved Lloyds as a
 party or by name in any other respect. Moreover, none involved
 the kind of issue that would have a direct or predictable impact
 on the insurance industry's Superfund obligations, much less on
 Lloyd's itself.

          The cases address a variety of matters. Most are highly
 fact-specific. Included among them are decisions that enforce an
 EPA penalty against a chemical company; apply the judicial
 doctrine of res iudicata (which bars relitigation of the same
 matter); and confirm the federal government's sovereign immunity
 from state requests for civil penalties on CERCLA claims.

          A summary of the cases is attached.

 1. Waterville Industries. Inc. v. Finance Aut-hnritv of Maine. 984
F.2d 540 (1st Cir. 1993). The issue in this case was the
 "security interest exception" in CERCLA, which exempts from the
statute's definition of "owner" a "person who, without
participating in the management of a vessel or facility, holds
indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest
in the vessel or facility." In an opinion by Judge Boudin,
joined by Judge Breyer, the court interpreted the provision and
unanimously agreed with the Finance Authority of Maine that it
met the requirements of the provision.

          Particularly because there is no reason to think that a
lender, a borrower, or a property owner is more or less likely to
have insurance, the case does not present the kind of issue that
would have a direct or predictable impact on the insurance
industry's Superfund obligations.

2. State of Maine v. Dept. of N a w f 973 F.2d 1007 (1st Cir.
1992). In this case, the state of Maine sued the United States
Navy because one of the Navy's shipyards had not complied with
Maine's federally-approved hazardous waste laws. The only
CERCLA-related issue was whether the CERCLA statute waives the
federal government's traditional sovereign immunity against suits
by states for civil penalties. Judge Breyer's opinion held that
the CERCLA statute does not waive th« federal government's
sovereign immunity.

3. Reardon v. United States. 947 F.2d 1509 (1st Cir. 1991) (en
bane). The issue in this case was whether landowners are
entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before the EPA
is allowed to place a lien on their property. In an opinion by
Judge Torruella, joined by Judge Breyer, the First Circuit
applied a recent Supreme Court precedent, which had found a
Connecticut attachment lien statute violated due process. The
First Circuit held that CERCLA's lien provision had a similar
flaw.

         The case thus gives people the right to notice and an
opportunity to be heard before a lien is put on their property.
It concerns the timing of procedures, and in no way eliminates,
lessens, or affects the liability of landowners who are
responsible for clean-up costs.

4. All Regions Chemical Labs v. EPA. 932 F.2d 73 (1st Cir. 1991).
In this case, Judge Breyer's opinion upheld the EPA's imposition
of a $20,000 penalty against a chemical company that failed to
                                      324

 notify the EPA immediately about the release of hazardous
 substances from its property.

           In this highly fact-specific case, the decision upholds the
 EPA's penalty, over the private company's objection.

 5. Johnson v. SCA Disposal Services of New England. 931 F.2d 970
  (1st Cir. 1991). Judge Brown's opinion, joined by Judge Breyer,
 applies the judicial doctrine of res iudicata. which prohibits
 relitigation of the same matter. It does not address CERCLA or
 Superfund issues.

 6. United States v. Kavser-Roth. 910 F.2d 24 (1st Cir. 1990). in
 an opinion by Judge Bownes, joined by Judge Breyer, the court
 agreed with EPA that a parent company could be found to be an
 "operator" liable for clean-up costs even if the site was
 nominally run by a subsidiary. The court also agreed with the
 EPA that the trial court properly found that the parent company
 was an "operator" in this case.

          The decision does not present the kind of issue that would
 have a direct or predictable impact on the insurance industry's
 Superfund obligations. (In many CERCLA cases, there are numerous
private parties with conflicting allocation claims, and imposing
 liability on parent corporations might have different effects on
different insurers at different times).

7. United States v. Ottati & Goss. 900 F.2d 429 (1st Cir. 1990).
In this decision by Judge Brevet, the court agreed with the
district court ..hat, when EPA requests a preliminary injunction
under a particular CERCLA provision, the district court has
discretion and is not, contrary to EPA's submission, obliged to
defer to EPA's request for an injunction unless it is "arbitrary
or capricious." The First Circuit emphasized that "to read the
statute in this way does not significantly handicap EPA" because
the agency may receive full administrative deference at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings. The Court of Appeals also
reviewed the district court's factual findings, agreed with EPA
that the district court should further consider one matter, and
found that the district court's other findings were supported by
the record. The court also ruled on various miscellaneous
issues, including one in which it agreed with EPA that the
district court should further consider whether EPA should be
entitled to recover certain costs.

         None of the holdings in the case presents the kind of issue
that would have a direct or predictable impact on the insurance
industry's Superfund obligations. The standard for district
court consideration of requests for preliminary injunctive relief
concerns only district court discretion at a preliminary stage of
the proceedings. The factual issues, moreover, are highly case-
specific and dependent on the record in the particular case.

8. Dedham Water Co. v. Continental Farms Diary. 889 F.2d 1146
(1st Cir. 1989). In this opinion by Judge Bownes, the First
Circuit agreed with other courts that a plaintiff need show only
that a defendant's release of hazardous wastes caused it to incur
response costs, not that the wastes actually contaminated the
plaintiff's property. Particularly because either side in such a
dispute might have insurance, the case does not present the kind
of issue that would have a material or predictable impact on the
insurance industry's Superfund obligations. (A subsequent
opinion in the case specified that a new trial was required.
Judge Breyer dissented, arguing that the district court should
have discretion to further consider the matter. The issue was
unrelated to CERCLA or Superfund. In re Dedham Water Co.. 901
F.2d 3 (1st cir. 1990)).

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
224 Dirksen Office Building
DC 20510

Dear Senator Biden,

         As one who has worked in the field of lawyers' and
judges' ethics for almost three decades, I write to
oppose the confirmation of Chief Judge Stephen Breyer as
a member of the Supreme Court. My opposition is based
upon Judge Breyer's violation of the Federal
Disqualification Statute, 28 U.S.C. §455.

         We have heard much in recent years about a "litmus
test" for judges. The reference has been to the
nominees' positions on substantive issues, and the test
has fluctuated with the politics of the moment. If there
is one test that should be constant, however, it is that
the record of a nominee for judicial office should not be
tainted by a serious violation of judicial ethics. Judge
Breyer fails that test.

                   The Disqualification Statute (5455^

         The Federal Disqualification Statute (§4 55) was
enacted by Congress to ensure respect for the integrity
of the federal judiciary. Discussing the statute in the
Lilieberg case, the Supreme Court said that "We must
continuously bear in mind that to perform its high
function in the best way, 'justice must satisfy the
appearance of justice.'""

         The problem, the Supreme Court explained, is that

          · Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Con:'.,
108 S. Ct. 2194, 2205 (1988), quoting In re Murehison, 75
S.Ct. 62 3. 62 5 (1955).
                                   326

"people who have not served on the bench are often all
too willing to indulge suspicions and doubts concerning
the integrity of judges."2 Section 455(a) wa3 therefore
adopted to "promote confidence in the judiciary" and to
eliminate those "suspicions and doubts."

         Accordingly, §455(a) expressly requires that every
federal judge "shall", disqualify himself from any case in
which his impartiality "might" reasonably be "ques-
tioned.ni This statutory language is intentionally
broad, requiring the judge to avoid the "appearance of
impropriety whenever possible."4

         Writing for the Supreme Court just this year.
Justice Scalia said that §455(a) covers all forms of
partiality, and "requirefs] them all to be evaluated on
an objective basis, so that what matters is not the
reality of [partiality] but its appearance."5 And
Justice Scalia added: "Quite simply and quite
universally, recusal was required whenever 'impartiality
mi/ght reasonably be questioned.'"6

         This objective standard -- which is to be applied
"universally" and "whenever possible," -- means that the
judge cannot remain in a case on the ground that he,
personally, is a person of integrity who would not be
affected by a personal financial concern. Rather, t.he
question is whether the "average judge" would be offered
a "possible temptation" not to "hold the balance nice,

        That last quotation goes back to cases decided even
before §455 was enacted -- cases like Tumey, MurchJ3on,
and Lavoie.e Those cases hold that constitutional due
process requires the judge to disqualify himself unless
his interest is "so remote, trifling, and insignificant"
as to be "incapable of affecting" an individual's
judgment.9

             Judge Breyer' a Violation of the Statute

        I have quoted at some length from controlling
Supreme Court cases like Liteky, Lilieberg, Tumey.
Murchison, and Lavoie, because, so far, they have been
virtually ignored in these hearings. Neither Professor
Stephen Gillers nor Professor Geoffrey Hazard has
discussed these cases in their letters to the Committee
in which they conclude that Judge Breyer did not violate
the Statute.10

        Judge Breyer was a member, or Name, in the Lloyd's
Merrett syndicate 418 in 1985, insuring asbestos and
pollution losses.11 His exposure to liability continues
to this day. As of 1993, the total losses on that
account were $245.6 million. Other Names have had their
fortunes wiped out in total Lloyd's liabilities

v. Lavoie, 106 S.Ct. 1580 (1986).

         9 The quote goes back to Justice Cooley's treatise.
Constitutional Limitations.

         1"' Professor Gillers cites Liteky only for the point
(which is immaterial to his conclusion) that "[w]hile
§455(a) and §455(b) overlap, they are not congruent."

         ": The information was first revealed publicly in an
article in Newsdav on June 24, 1994.
                                   328

approaching $12 billion. For years, therefore, the Names
have been understandably jittery.

        The New York Times has described Judge Breyer's
membership in Lloyd's as "A Tricky Investment."12
Although Judge Breyer has assured this Committee that he
will get out of his membership as soon as possible, this
is a questionable pledge. He himself has testified that
he has been trying to extricate himself for years. And
according to Richard Rosenblatt, who heads a group of
hundreds of American Names who are "afraid of being wiped
out," it would cost Judge Breyer more that $1 million to
insure himself against his personal share of his
syndicate's losses.13 Even then,.he would remain liable
if his insurer could not pay.14

        Judge Breyer and the White House have assured this
Committee and the public that Judge Breyer's reasonably
anticipated liability is negligible. And the ethics
experts who have "cleared" Judge Breyer have based their
opinions on just such misleading assumptions. As
Professor Hazard says, he was told to assume that Judge
Breyer's possible losses are well within "stop-loss"
insurance coverage that the Judge already has. For
similar reasons, Professor Gillers has commented that his
own opinion is "rather narrow."15

        But consider Mr. Rosenblatt's estimate that
insurance coverage of Judge Breyer's liability would cost
more than $1 million. That reflects the calculation of
hard-headed actuaries, not overly optimistic politicians
eager to minimize the true dimensions of the Judge's
difficulties.

        Having said that, let me emphasize that my opinion
is not dependent upon the precise size of Judge Breyer's
liability.16 As Professor Hazard said in his opinion,
the business of insurance is complex, sometimes
controversial, and "widely the subject of public concern
and suspicion." Unfortunately, Professor Hazard did not
recognize that his own description of Judge Breyer's
position as an insurer echoes the Supreme Court's
description of the purpose of §455 -- to avoid public
"suspicion and doubts." Predictably, and properly,
"public concern and suspicion" have been focused on the
integrity of the judiciary because of Judge Breyer's
failure to disqualify himself when the Statute required
him to do so.

        As the White House has admitted, Judge Breyer "knew"
or "could have known" that environmental pollution was
one of the risks he was insuring as a Name. (In fact, he
was notified of this by his syndicate.) But, they
contend, he did not know precisely which of his cases
involved those risks. In effect, they argue that Judge
Breyer could not know for sure whether a particular
pollution defendant standing before him was carrying the
Judge's blank check in his pocket.

        But under §455(c) of the Disqualification Statute,
the Judge had an absolute responsibility to "inform
himself about his personal ... financial interests." *7
(Professors Gillers and Hazard ignore this requirement in
their opinion letters.) Thus, the bizarre defense of
Judge Breyer is that he violated his statutory duty to
know the details of his personal financial interest, and
therefore he didn't violate his statutory duty to
disqualify himself.

        ·6 See the original article in Newsday, June 24,
1994.

        "' This is in contrast to the second clause of the
same subsection, which requires only that he make a
"reasonable effort" to inform himself about the financial
interests of members of his household.
                                      330

        In fact. Judge Breyer did violate the statute in
failing to disqualify himself. Take, for example, United
States v. Ottati & Goes, Inc.15 Two years after Lilie-
berg explained the broad scope of §455(a), Judge Breyer
failed to disqualify himself from Ottati & Goss -- even
though the case involved the Environmental Protection
Agency's powers to impose liability on polluters like
those the Judge knew he was insuring.

        In Ottati & Goss, the issue was whether the EPA
could impose remedies against polluters, subject to
judicial revision only on a finding that the EPA had
arbitrarily and capriciously abused its powers. Lower
court decisions were split on the issue. A decision by
the First Circuit would be an important precedent.

        Judge Breyer expressly recognized this in his
opinion in Ottati & Goss, saying that the case raised a
question with "implications for other cases as well as
this one." And he said again: "The EPA's ... argument
[has] implications beyond the confines of this case."

        That was enough to require that Judge Breyer
disqualify himself. In effect, he was in the position of
deciding his own case, or, at least, of setting a
precedent that could affect his own liability.

        How the Judge ultimately decided the case has no
effect on his duty to disqualify himself. His decision
in Ottati & Goss compounds the appearance of impropriety
that the Statue forbids, because the Judge wrote an
opinion weakening the power of the EPA to impose
liability on polluters. And his opinion, predictably,
has been influential, causing the EPA to change its own
regulations.

        Similarly, Judge Breyer participated in Reardon v.
United States,"' where the First Circuit again made it
more difficult for the EPA to impose liability on

           ·'- 900 F . 2d 4 29 (1 990 ) .

           ··· 94 7 F.2d 1509.
                      331

polluters. In Rear don, the EPA had removed tons of
contaminated soil and put a lien on the property to
secure payment of its costs. The loss represented by
that lien is the same kind of loss that Judge Breyer was
liable to reimburse as an insurer. And the decision held
that the EPA did not have the power to impose the lien.

Is it not clear that Judge Breyer's impartiality

"might" reasonably be "questioned" in Ottati & Gosa and

in Reardon?  Would not his participation cause

"suspicions and doubts" about the integrity of judges?

Is that not precisely the problem that the Congress

intended to resolve with §455(a) of the Disqualification

Statute?

        One contention put forth by the White House is that
Judge Breyer was not asked to disqualify himself by a
litigant. That is irrelevant. The Statute doe3 not
permit a judge to wait to see whether a litigant has
smoked out his interest and makes a motion for
disqualification. Rather, the Statute is "self-
executing," requiring the judge to take the initiative.
As Justice Scalia said for a unanimous Court in Liteky,
the Statute "placed the obligation to identify the
existence of those grounds upon the judge himself, rather
than requiring recusal only in response to a party
affidavit. "20

        Another contention is that the Judge's membership in
Lloyd's is "analogous" to being an investor in a mutual
fund, and therefore is exempt from the statute under
§455(d)(4). There are two important differences between
being a name in Lloyd's and being an investor in a mutual
fund. One is that mutual fund3 are typically highly
diverse. But Lloyd's is solely involved in insurance,
and the Judge knew that one or more of his insurance
liabilities related to environmental pollution. Another
major difference is that an investor in a mutual fund
cannot lose more than the principle invested. In
Lloyd's, on the contrary, one's entire fortune i3 at
risk, a3 hundreds of Names have found to their dismay in

             at 115.
                          332

recent years.

         It has also been argued that §455(a) is not the
right section to apply. The contention is that the
correct section is §455(b)(4), which (on one reading)
requires that the judge's interest "could" be
"substantially affected by the outcome of the
proceeding." There are three answers to that argument.

         First, those who make that contention have been
assuming, contrary to fact, that the Judge's potential
liability is negligible. (See discussion above).

         Second, §4 55(b) does not require that the Judge's
interest be "substantial" if it is an interest in the
"subject matter in controversy." In that event, the
judge must disqualify himself "however 3mall" his
interest might be. §455(d)(4). And some read the phrase
"subject matter in controversy" to include the remedy --
such as the lien in Reardon -- if that is what the
litigation is about. One could similarly say that the
subject matter of the controversy in Ottati & Goss was
the enforcement powers of the EPA. Thus, Judge Breyer
was required to disqualify himself under §455(b)(4) in
both those cases "however small" his financial interest
in the outcome might be.

Third, the "substantially affected" provision of

§455(b)(4) does not preclude application of the basic

provision, §455(a).       And §455(a) can require

disqualification when the Judge's impartiality "might

reasonably be questioned" even when the amount of

financial interest is not in fact substantial. In

Liljeberg, for example, the Supreme Court relied

principally upon §455(a) even while recognizing that

§455(b)(4) al3o applied.

         Ignoring the Supreme Court cases in point, Professor

Gillers has placed his primary reliance on In re Placid
Oi1 Company. ~l But Placid Qi1 is obsolete, having been

decided two years before Lilieberg (discussed above).

802 F.2d 783 (5th C u . , 1986
                                     333

With no analysis whatsoever, the appeals court in Placid
Oil said in a single conclusory sentence that the judge's
interest in that case did not create a situation in which
a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
The court also said that the judge'3 interest at issue
was, in fact, "remote, contingent, and speculative" --
unlike Judge Breyer's position in Ottati & Goss and Rear-
don. Professor Gillers' reliance upon the obsolete and
limited holding in Placid Oil, while ignoring Lilieberg
and all of the other Supreme Court authorities, renders
his opinion highly questionable.

         The court in Placid Oil also says that a judge is
not automatically disqualified if he has any stock at all
in a company that is in the same industry as a litigant.
That certainly remains true. But Judge Breyer has much
more than a minor interest in a company in the same
industry. He is an insurer with a potential liability
that he cannot avoid for less than $1,000,000.

         In addition, Judge Breyer, with his wife, holds
investments of over $2 50,000 in chemical and
pharmaceutical companies. Moody's Investors Service says
that these are "among the highest risks" for Superfund
liability.22

         Judge Breyer has also held significant long-term
investments in several liability insurance carriers that,
according to the Financial Times, have been "haunted by
the prospect of big claims for environmental liability,"
especially Superfund./3

         In 1994 his biggest single U.S. investment is
American International Group. According to Best'a Review
-- an industry trade magazine and investment adviser --
A.I.G. is "depending on ... judicial trends" on Superfund

of Bruce Shapiro in The Nation, p. 76, July IS, 1994.

for its future financial health.^

         The Judge also owns stock in General Re Corporation.
That company's 1994 annual report warns investors that
their future earnings could be affected by "new theories
of liability and new contract interpretations" by judges
on Super fund.25

         Judge Breyer appears to have been accommodating
these concerns. And his investments in such companies --
unlike that in Lloyd's -- are investments that a judge
with ethical sensitivity could, and would, have gotten
out of and stayed away from.

                   Conclusion

Chief Judge Stephen Breyer has more than once

violated the Federal Disqualification Statute -- a

Statute that was designed to ensure the constitutional

requirement that "justice must satisfy the appearance of

justice."  In violating that Statute, he has,

predictably, caused the very "suspicions and doubts"

about the integrity of judges that the Statute was

enacted to avoid.

         These violations of his judicial responsibilities
raise serious doubts about how Judge Breyer would conduct
himself as a Justice of the Supreme Court. And his
refusal to recognize anything more serious than
"imprudence" reinforces those doubts.

         In addition. Judge Breyer's violations, and his
insistence that he has done nothing improper, raise the
concern that as a member of the Supreme Court, Judge
Breyer would vote to weaken the Federal Disqualification
Statute, thereby encouraging other federal judges to
disregard the intent of Congress in enacting that law.

For these reasons, I oppose confirmation of Judge

       The Honorable Joseph R. Biden
       Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary
       United States Senate
       224 Dirksen Office Building
       Washington, D.C. 20510

       Dear Chairman Biden:

                The White House Counsel's Office has given me a copy
       of Professor Monroe Preedman's letter to you of July 13,
       1994, and asked me to reply to it. Since the letter takes
       issue with my July 8, 1994 letter to the white House
       Counsel, I appreciate having this opportunity to do so.
       The issue, of course, is whether chief Judge Stephen
       Breyer violated 28 TJ.S.C. 8455 when he sat in certain
       pollution cases while he was also a "Name" in a Lloyd's
       syndicate. Z will assume general familiarity with the
       facts and the prior correspondence.

                Professor Preedman is in my opinion in error when he
       charges Judge Breyer with illegal conduct. Professor
       Freedman has misconstrued the governing rules and ignored
       governing precedent. X shall explain how presently.
       First, though, the Committee should be aware of a
       critical doctrine that has not yet been identified.

                Section 455, which derives from the 1972 ABA. Code of
       Judicial Conduct, states the Congressional rules for
       recusal of a federal judicial officer. The section has
       two kinds of rules: categorical rules and standards. The
       categorical rules require no judgment. They either apply
       or they do not. The standards, by contrast, require
       judgment.

                An example of a categorical rule is S45S(b)(5)(1),
       which would require a judge to step aside if the judge's
       "spouse, or a person within the third degree of
                          337

relationship to aither of them...is a party to the
proceeding...." This circumstance either exists or it
does not. If it does, recusal ia required.

         The two provisions of 8455 that have been cited in
connection with Judge Breyer (until Professor Freedman
injected a third, discussed below) contain standards, not
categorical rules. The first standard is that part of
§455(b)(4) that requires recusal if the judge (as an
individual or fiduciary) or certain relatives of the
judge have "any other intarest that could be
substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding. *
The second standard is 5455 (a), which requires recusal if
the judge's "impartiality might reasonably be
questioned."

         As should be clear, these two standards require a
judge to interpret imprecise words like "could,"
"substantially affected," "might" and "reasonably." The
meaning of these words (and the standards that contain
them) are, of course, clarified as cases construe them,
but they have never, and were not intended to, become
fixed categories.

         When we deal with standards, we deal with a
continuum. In some matters, it will be self-evident that
a judge's "impartiality might reasonably be questioned"
or that a proceeding's "outcome" could "substantially"
affect a judge's interests. In other matters, the
opposite will be clear. But in many cases, different
judges will apply the standards differently.

         That doesn't mean that one judge is right and the
other judge wrong. It means only that as with all
flexible standards there will be room for disagreement.
The way that' the judicial system accommodates this
reality is pertinent to the questions before the
Judiciary Committee.

        Appellate courts routinely defer to a judge's
decision regarding application of a standard by upholding
the decision unless it was an "abuse of discretion." Tow^
of Worfolk v. U.fl. Army Corps of Entylnaara. 968 F.2d
1438, 1460 (1st Cir. 1992); Pope v. Federal Express
CQXXU. 974 P.2d 982, 985 (8th Cir. 1992) . This test
recognises that there is significant room for
                           338

disagreement in the application of a standard. Reasonable
minds may differ and neither will be wrong.

         While Professor Freedman holds that Judge Breyer
should have recused himself in certain of his pollution
cases, I and others who study the law of judicial
disqualification have reached an opposite conclusion.
That difference of opinion is rather strong evidence that
the situations confronting Judge Breyer did not self-
evidently require his recusal, but were instead
situations in which reasonable minds might differ on the
application of the standard. Judge's Breyer's conduct was
not, therefore, an abuse of discretion and Judge Breyer
did not violate §455 notwithstanding that another judge
might have elected differently.

         Not only do I believe that Judge Breyer'a decision
to sit in the pollution cases was reasonable, I believe
it was right. In the balance of this letter, I will
explain why §455 did not disqualify Judge Breyer and
where I think Professor Freedman goes wrong.

         1 have already quoted from 5455(b)(4) . A judge must
not sit if the judge (including certain relatives) has
"any other interest that could be substantially affected
by the outcome of the proceeding." The words "any other
interest" are to be distinguished from a separate basis
for recusal if a judge has a "financial interest in the
subject matter of the proceeding or in a party to the
proceeding." Such a "financial interest" requires
recusal "however small." Section 455(d)(4).

         No one has suggested that Judge Breyer had a
"financial interest" in a party to proceedings before
him. Professor Freedman has rhetorically asked, however,
whether Judge Breyer had a "financial interest" in the
"subject matter" of proceedings before him. (Freedman
letter at p. 8.) This suggestion is wrong, as I shall
discuss below.

         in order to trigger 5455<b)(4)'s r«fer«nce to "any
other interest," several facts must be true (and the
judge's failure to recognize their truth must be an abuse
of discretion) . These facts are that the (i) the judge
has an "other interest" that (ii) "could be" (iii)
"substantially affected" by (iv) "the outcome of the
                          339

proceeding.n

         Judge Breyer had an investment in Lloyd'B. I assumed
in my letter to Mr. Cutler that he had unlimited
financial exposure on that investment. That satiofios
factor (i). However, it does not Batisfy factor (ill),
even though I am assuming that Judge Breyer's financial
exposure is unlimited.

         The word "substantially" refers to the effect on the
"interest" that the "outcome of the proceeding" "could"
have. Professor Thode, the Reporter for the ABA Judicial
Conduct Code from which this part of 5455 (b) (4) was
drawn, has written: 'Here the issue is not whether a
judge has a 'substantial interest,' but whether the
interest he has could be substantially affected by a
decision in the proceeding before him." E. Thode,
Reporter'a Notes to Code of Judicial Conduct 66
(1973)(hereafter "Thode").

         In measuring the possible effect of the 'outcome of
the proceeding" on the judge's interest, we must construe
the word "could." As stated, "could" is not a precise
word. "Could" could mean "could conceivably" or it could
require a closer nexus between tho outcome of the
proceeding and the effect on the judge's interest. The
courts have construed "could" to require a closer nexus.

         My letter to Mr. Cutler cites two cases that require
a "direct" connection between the outcome of a proceeding
and the judge's interest. By contrast, a "remote,
contingent:, and speculative interest" will not suffice.
In ra Placid Oil Co. . 802 F.2d 783, 786-77 (5th Cir.
1986); Gaa Utilities Co. of Alabama. Inc. v. Southern
Natural Gas Co. . 996 P.2d 282 (11th Cir. 1993), cert ·
denied,. 114 S.Ct. 687 (1994).

         While Professor Freedman suggests (p.9) that Placid
Oil is ·obsolete," because of the Supreme Court's
decision in LlHeberq v. Health Services Acquisition
C Q T J U ' 486 U.S. 847 (1988), two year later, this is
wrong. First, the Eleventh Circuit cited Placid Oil in
1993 for the very point made here. Other courts have
cited it, too, after Mlicfafln- See, e.g., McCann v.
PnimrrmrinflfilonB Design Corp.. 775 P. Supp. 1535 (D. Conn.
1991).
                         340

         Second, the facts of U H a h a r o cure dramatically
different form those in Placid Oil. In LlHeberg. a
university with which the judge had a fiduciary
relationship would (as a result of contractual
obligations and real estate values) gain millions of
dollars i£ the judge awarded the rights to a certificate
of need for a hospital to the defendant. That gave the
judge, as fiduciary, an interest "however email" in the
subject of the litigation (the certificate) and also an
interest that could be substantially affected by the
outcome of the proceeding. The facts of U H e h t r o show a
"direct" effect on the judge's interest as a fiduciary,
and of course the effect was substantial.

         Permit me to make this clearer with an example.
Assume that the outcome of a case will nearly certainly
cause a $100 decline in the value of the judge's stock
interest. The effect, then, is "direct," but the judge's
financial interest is not "substantially affected"
because the amount is too small. Now assume an
omniscient observer could tell us that the outcome of a
proceeding will have l/l000th of a chance of causing the
judge's stock interest to decline by $100,000. There, the
effect is substantial but it is not "direct."

         Professor Freedman cites two cases in which he
concludes Judge Breyer should not have participated. Did
the Judge abuse his discretion by concluding that the
decisions in these cases could not have a direct and
substantial affect on hiB financial interest in Lloyd's?
That is the question.

          One issue in United states v. ottati & G O B S . inc..
900 F.2d 429 (1st cir. 1990), the issue Professor
Freedman cite8, was whether a federal judge had to grant
the EPA the precise injunction it requested (so long as
the request was not arbitrary) or whether instead the
judge had broader discretion. Judge Breyer held that the
judge had broader discretion.

         Professor Freedman writes that Judge Breyer should
not have properly decided that case because it "involved
the [EPA's] powers to impose liability on polluters like
those the Judge knew he was insuring." (Freedman letter
at p. 6.) This is just wrong. It is not the standard.
Professor Freedman cannot say with any degree of
341

confidence that the decision in Ottati & Goaa would have
a direct and substantial effect on the judge's interests.
Furthermore, Professor Freedman leaves out an important
part of the case. The EPA had two routes for seeking
judicial injunctions. It had proceeded under one of them,
judge Breyer expressly acknowledged that if it had
proceeded via the other route (seeking enforcement of a
nonarbltrary BPA order!, "the court mist enforce it. · id
at 434.

         How think about the chain of events one would have
to envision to get from the holding in ottati ft Qamm to
the conclusion that Judge Broyar's interests could be
directly and substantially affected. One would have to
say that because a trial judge will have discretion
whether to grant an BPA injunction when the BPA proceeds
along one route rather than another, it could happen that
in another case the BPA would elect that first route in
an action against an insured of Judge Breyer's Lloyd's
syndicate, that the judge in that case will deny BPA the
injunction it seeks (relying on the discretion Judge
Breyer's opinion affords), that the syndicate would not
have to pay to comply with the particular injunction BPA
wanted, and that the effect from all this on Judge
Breyer's ore rata financial interest in the syndicate
would be "substantial.· That chain of events is what the
caselaw Means when it uses the words "remote, contingent,
and speculative.·

Professor Preedman also cites Raardon v.  ^^

Statafl/ 947 F.2d 1509 (1st Cir. 1991) . Reardon ie even a

more farfetched example than ottati & Goaa. Judge Breyer

sat on an en bane court that held that, absent exigent

circumstances, due process required "notice of an

intention to file a notLee of lien and provision for a

hearing if the property owner claimed that the lien was

wrongfully imposed." Id. at 1522. Professor Preedman

wrongly nays that the decision "held that tho BPA did not
have the power to impose the lien.1* (letter at p.7.) It

did, so long as it gave notice of ita intention to do ao

and afforded a hearing thereafter.

         Professor Freedman connects Reardon to the situation
at hand this way: "The loss represented by that lien is
the same kind of loss that Judge Breyer was liable to
reimburse as an insurer," (letter at p. 7.) This is
                        342

beyond "speculative." What "loss" is Professor Freedman
referring to? Think about the extended chain of events
one would have to describe to get from the Reardon
holding to Judge Breyer's interests. The EPA would have
to give notice of an intent to impose a lien on property
of an insured of the Judge's Lloyd's syndicate. Then,
before the EPA could file its lien, the recipient of the
notice would have had to defeat that effort by making a
quick disposition of the property, thereby defeating the
BPA's security interest. As a result of that disposition,
somehow (I'm not clear how) the syndicate would escape
its insurance responsibility and the pro, rata savings to
Judge Breyer in particular would have to be substantial.
Reardon simply does not support Professor Freedman's
conclusion.

         Before I leave 1455(b), I want to recognize that a
"remote, contingent, and speculative" interest is not the
same as no conceivable interest whatsoever. A system of
judicial recusal must balance between the risk of real or
apparent personal interest, on the one hand, and an
unduly broad standard that disqualifies a large number of
judges (or severely limits their investments), on the
other. A broad standard would lead cautious judges to
step aside no matter how improbable an effect on their
interests. I believe the courts have' struck the right
balance. But the line will sometimes be unclear, calling
on the judge to exercise discretion.

         On occasion, by definition, even a remote interest
will become a reality. Today's issue of Hewsday reports
that a loser in a case before Judge Breyer sued a. Lloyd's
syndicate for reimbursement of its expenditures under an
insurance policy the loser had with Lloyd's. The
syndicate may or may not have been Judge Breyer's
syndicate. Let's assume it was Judge Breyer's syndicate.
That is part of the price of a balanced rule. A rule that
prohibited a judge from sitting if a decision could have
any conceivable effect on his or her interests would have
its own (in my view less appealing) price.

         In addition, I have been asked to assume that Judge
Breyer did not and could not have known the particular
insureds under his Lloyd's syndicate. Section 455(b)
quite clearly requires knowledge.
                                 343

                    Professor Freedman also relies on S455(a), which
           requires recusal if a judge's "impartiality might
           reasonably be questioned." Apparently, Professor Freedman
           believes it to have been an abuse of discretion for Judge
           Breyer not to recuse himself under this provision.

                    Section 455(a) requires recusal when an "objective,
           diaintereated, observer fully informed of the facts
           underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would
           entertain significant doubt that justice would be done"
           in the particular case. Union Carbide Cornr v. U.S.
           Cutting Service. Tnc.. 782 F.2d 710, 715 (7th Cir. 1986) .
           I do not believe that conclusion can be reached on the
           facts of the cases in which Judge Breyer sat. Certainly,
           it was not an abuse of discretion to reject application
           of 8455(a) as so defined.

                    A stronger objection to §455(a) exists. As I
           mentioned in my letter to Mr. Cutler, while not
           congruent, 8455 (a) and §455 (b) do overlap. As a matter of
           statutory interpretation, it is improper to resort to
           $455(a) when Congress has specifically legislated
           criteria for recusal in the particular circumstances
           described in 8455(b) and these criteria are absent. As
           the Court wrote in Litekv v. United states. 114 S.Ct.
           1147, 1156 n.2 (1994), "it is poor statutory construction
           to interpret (a) as nullifying the limitations (b)
           provides, except to the extent the text requires."

                    Here, 8455(b)(4), as construed in caselaw, requires
           that the outcome of the proceeding before the judge have
           both a direct and substantial effect on the judge's
           interests. Liteky tells us that we should not use S455 (a)
           to "nullify" these requirements. Specifically, here, we
           should not use 8455(a) to require recusal where the
           effect is "remote" or "speculative" or "contingent." In
           any event, the same test is employed to reject recusal
          under 5455 (a). ^n re Dnexel Burnham Lambert. Inc. 861
           F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir. 1988) (remote, contingent, or
           speculative interest does not reasonably bring judge's
           impartiality into question.)

                    Let me conclude by addressing two other of Professor
           Freedman's points. First, he suggests that Judge Breyer
          might have had a "financial interest" in the "subject

                                                            8

matter" of the cases before him because the legal issue
he decided could arise In a case involving hia Lloyd's
syndicate. Professor Freedman does not even adopt this
view himself. He says merely that "some have read* the
phrase "subject matter in controversy" to include the
remedy, like the lien at issue in Reardon. He also writes
that " [o] ne could similarly say" that EPA enforcement
powers in Qttati & G O S H were the "subject matter" of that
controversy.

         'One" could, of course, "say" many things, just as
"some11 may have "read* the statute a variety of ways. But
the fact is that no authority supports the view that a
judge can have a "financial interest" in a question of
law. As Professor Thode explained, the "subject matter"
language "becomes significant in in ram proceedings.*
Thode at 65. Another example is LiHebara. where the
university on whose board the judge sat had a financial
interest riding on the holder of the certificate of need,
which was the subject matter before the judge. This is
not a case like TmiWY Y- state of Ohio. 273 tf.S. 510
(1927), cited by Professor Freedman, where the
adjudicator had a financial interest in the very fine he
imposed on the defendant because he would receive part of
it.

         Professor Freedman suggests (p. S) that Judge Breyer
violated his duty to keep himself informed of his
financial interests. Section 4S5(c). My letter was
premised on two assumptions about what Judge Breyer knew
or could have known and what he did not know and could
not have known. I charged him with knowledge of what he
could have known but he can't be faulted with not knowing
what he could not have known.

         Thank you for this opportunity.

                                                      Sincerely,

  Judge BREYER. Yes, Senator. I have taken into account your con-
cern, and I understand the concern, and I think it is extremely im-
portant that people have confidence in the integrity and that there
is absolutely no conflict in such circumstances. What I intend to do,
as I said, is that whatever investment I have in this area in what-
ever court I am in will be posted clearly, all information given, with
the clerk of court. The parties in every case will be directed to that
so they will find it and know what it says. They will be told that,
anonymously--anonymously--they may write out or tell orally to
the clerk any way in which they see that the holding in this case
could really affect that investment.

  Then the clerk would or an appropriate person would commu-
nicate that to me anonymously. I would consider very carefully, in
light of what you and others have said, whether in any case there
would be really an impact on the investment from the holding of
that case. And should I conclude there would be, I would recuse
myself.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I believe that that is a major step in the
right direction. I think it is the right step, and I think that the con-
cerns that many of us have about your continued exposure in the
Merritt syndicate 418 may warrant or may necessitate your
recusing yourself in future cases.

  I believe that it is our obligation to and I think we have sen-
sitized you to this issue. Nobody has said, at least I have not said--
some have said but I have not said--that you have conducted your-
self in an unethical manner. I do not think that you have. But I
think that if the Ottati case were before you again, using the
present standard that you are talking about, I somehow have the
feeling that you might not have gone forward in hearing that case.

  It is a fait accompli, and you are not going to hear the case over
again, and so it does not necessitate our going into a lengthy dis-
cussion. But I think your new approach to matters, until you get
out of the Lloyd's investment, will be helpful, and at least this Sen-
ator thinks it will make you that much better a Supreme Court ju-
rist than I hope you will be notwithstanding.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I guess my time has expired.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU can have more time, because I interrupted
you, if you want to take a few more minutes.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Several more. All right. I think I will.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  On this whole question of the Merritt 418 and its relationship to
your exposure and cases you have heard, the latest annual report
emphasizes not only the uncertain upper limit of losses, but also
the breadth of the exposure. With respect to asbestos, it says:

  The falling off in the number of new claims long predicted has yet to occur. Major
uncertainties lie in the estimate of the number of future claimants.

  You have already recused yourself in connection with asbestos
cases.

  With respect to pollution, it says:

  A number of claims have been made against our insureds and, therefore, against
us. The amount of theoretical aggregate liability is clearly huge and, indeed,
unquantifiable.
                                                  346

  Even the syndicate's auditor, the accounting firm of Ernst and
Young, will not give a firm opinion as to the size. I think that the
point that I would make with you, Judge, is that you were aware
that you had certain exposure. You had concerns. You actually sent
several letters to other investors in Merritt 418, dated from Feb-
ruary 1992 through February of this year.

  Those letters indicate your knowledge of Merritt's asbestos risk
in 1987 and 1988 and describe why you decided by 1988 to recuse
yourself from asbestos cases because of Merritt's asbestos risk.

  You say in one letter:

  I was surprised Merritt syndicate was involved more than average, for this seems
contrary to what I had wanted. As a result, I have had to disqualify myself on all
asbestos cases, and ultimately, for that reason, in 1988 I decided to leave Lloyd's.

  And then it goes on, other letters that you wrote.
  I think we can agree that the Merritt 418 was obviously a bad
investment. The Merritt 418 had all sorts of exposure, asbestos,
pollution, other kinds of exposures. And the question of your
recusing yourself in future cases until you can discharge yourself
of the liability, potential liability that you have arising out of it I
think is a valid concern. I think you have addressed yourself to
that concern. I am pretty well satisfied that when and if matters
come up before you, you will be aware of some of the questions that
have been discussed with you here, and I wish you well.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Does that mean the matter is closed, Senator?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Pardon?
  The CHAIRMAN. Does that mean the matter is closed?
  Senator METZENBAUM. For the moment. [Laughter.]
  I think so, but who knows what the next hour will bring?
  The CHAIRMAN. I surely do not.
  I know the next 10 minutes will bring a break. You have been
sitting there a long time, Judge. Why don't we break until 10 min-
utes after. That is about 8 or 10 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Our next questioner is the distinguished Senator from Wyoming,
Senator Simpson. Senator, the floor is yours.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much.
  Judge Breyer and associates, fellow lawyers and family and so
on. Anyway, in my first round of questions, I mentioned that bills
had been introduced in both Houses of Congress by members of
both parties to eliminate birthright citizenship. I kind of fired this
out the other day, knowing you would mull it, as you do. The issue
of eliminating birthright citizenship in the case of a child born in
the United States to persons who are here illegally.
  There are calls for repeal of what we would term birthright citi-
zenship for children of aliens who are in an illegal status, and part
of the impetus behind this interest in changing the law regarding
birthright citizenship is that these children, often born impover-
ished to impoverished parents, are immediately eligible for public
assistance, and then that assistance, of course, is provided to the
parents who care for their citizen child even though the parents
themselves would not qualify for public assistance because they are
illegal, undocumented persons.
                                             347

  Having been in this issue for some 15 years, I have never seen
more of a rush toward doing something. Things are being said by
people on both sides of the aisle that, if I had said them 10 years
ago, I would have been prey to the designation of bigotry or racism
or some other. But this is an issue filled with that when we talk
about immigration and refugees and legal and illegal and perma-
nent resident aliens and so on.

  But illegal immigration in the United States, in combination
with the development of the modern welfare state in this country,
has increased the fears and resentments of many citizens in the
most heavily impacted States.

  And as I mentioned to you, the citizenship clause of the 14th
amendment provides that any person born in the United States
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof is a citizen of the United
States.

  While the citizenship clause was intended originally to benefit
black Americans, it is obvious that this "jurisdiction requirement,"
as it has been called, was intended to narrow the scope of the
birthright citizenship principle.

  Clearly, the American-born children of foreign diplomats who re-
ceive extraterritorial immunity from our laws are not subject--not
subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Further, the debate over the
Civil Rights Act of 1866 makes clear that citizenship of Native-
Americans was also an issue.

  I mention the 1866 act because the citizenship clause in that
statute was apparently the basis for a similar provision in the 14th
amendment.

  So at the time the framers of the citizenship clause wrote that
provision, the United States maintained a policy of open borders.
It was a time when immigration was thoroughly encouraged. We
wanted to populate the vast open spaces of a young nation, and I
suppose there were no illegal aliens in 1868. Immigration at that
time was essentially unregulated. Today the vast majority of Amer-
icans would consider an open-border policy to be nonsensical, if not
unthinkable. And so, rather, now all policy discussions today
revolve around control of our borders and a sovereign nation's duty
to control its borders.

  One scholar examined this issue of birthright citizenship in some
depth. His name was Peter Schuck, of Yale. He has written:

  It is difficult to defend a practice that extends birthright citizenship to the native-
born children of illegal aliens. Parents of such children are, by definition, individ-
uals whose presence within the jurisdiction of the United States is prohibited by
law. They are manifestly individuals, therefore, to whom the society has explicitly
and self-consciously decided to deny membership. And if the society has refused to
consent to their membership, they can hardly be said to have consented to that of
their children who happen to be born while their parents are here in clear violation
of American law.

  In my view and research and study, the meaning of the clause
"subject to the jurisdiction thereof is very unclear and ambiguous.
And my question to you: As a general matter, may the Congress
by statute define an ambiguous constitutional provision?

  Judge BREYER. The short answer, Senator, is it would depend
upon the provision and it would depend upon the statute. You have
raised the question about whether those words "subject to the juris-
diction thereof are meant to exclude only a few people, such as
                                               348

diplomats' children and some others, or whether Congress can con-
trol that definition by statute.

  I understand the question, and I am absolutely certain if legisla-
tion of that sort is enacted, court challenge will follow immediately.
And, therefore, we would consider that--I would have to if I was
on the Court--in the context of litigation, get the briefs, get the ar-
guments, and think hard about it.

  Senator SIMPSON. Actually, mine is the general question, al-
though it was obviously long and somewhat tedious, about the sin-
gle issue of the birthright. But on the general question of whether
the Congress may statutorily define or clarify any ambiguous con-
stitutional provision, do you have a view on that, completely aside
from the citizenship clause jurisdiction issue requirement?

  Judge BREYER. The reason that I say I think it depends is be-
cause I know there are legal arguments about the extent to which
section 2, I guess, or section 5 of the 14th amendment does or does
not allow Congress to do or say certain things in statutes.

  So, not having gone into it thoroughly, I suspect it depends upon
the particular statute and the particular provision. Always there
will be a question with any statute and any provision: If there is
an area of ambiguity, does that particular statute nonetheless fall
outside of it? So those are the kinds of questions that would arise.

  Senator SIMPSON. And will arise?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, they will.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is why you do not intend to go any fur-
ther.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  Senator SIMPSON. IS that correct?
  Judge BREYER. That is exactly right.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thus sparing you further pain.
  Let me ask you, I want to follow up on home schooling. Surpris-
ingly enough, I have received a tremendous amount of mail. I do
not know what group is generating this, but I want to be certain--
and I know others have asked about it, and should, and my col-
league, Senator Warner, who is not on the panel, our panel, asked
me about it. And he, too, is receiving a great deal of material. But
we discussed the New Life Baptist Academy case Tuesday, and you
assured me you had nothing against or no bias against home
schooling.
  If I might just ask a final question on that, at least from me, as
a Justice you will be, of course, interpreting the Constitution. And
so I am interested, and I know many, as I say, in my State and
other States are interested, in hearing your interpretation of the
Constitution as it pertains to the right of parents to teach their
children at home and the right of religious organizations to operate
private schools.
  In your mind, what does the Constitution have to say about that?
  Judge BREYER. In general, though not in detail, I think it fair to
start from the proposition, it is true, religion is extremely impor-
tant to all of us. Even if we have different religions, we share the
fact that it is important. And from a constitutional point of view,
it is there protected in the first amendment because the Founders
recognized the importance of religion and the importance of allow-
ing people freely to exercise their religion. They had learned
                                         349

through experience. That experience came from the religious wars
of the 17th century. They put that in the Constitution to be abso-
lutely certain that that free exercise was protected.

  In my own view, if someone or a State or someone tried to pre-
vent people from teaching their religion to their children or practic-
ing a home school that was based on that kind of thing, very seri-
ous constitutional questions would arise. They would have to be de-
cided in the context of the case. But on their face, it would be a
very serious problem.

  Senator SIMPSON. But the Constitution, without
  Judge BREYER. It is designed to protect the right of the parents
to pass along to their children their religion and to protect that
from State interference.
   Senator SIMPSON. And to then also have home schools if that
  Judge BREYER. I think those home schools based on that prin-
ciple follow from that, and that is why I say somebody who tried
to prevent that legally would suddenly face very, very serious con-
stitutional challenges.
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that is important, and I have
been listening to what Senator Brown has asked, and others. It
seems rather absurd that you can get on your hind legs now and
do about any kind of oral expression known except you cannot pray
in schools. I do not know how it got to that point, but I think that
certainly there has been a great removal of religion from our soci-
ety. And I am not talking about forcing it on people, but commence-
ment exercises. I understand all those things, but it seems to me
that it is a part of the heritage of our country, one of the only coun-
tries on the face of the Earth founded in a belief in God, that is
the United States.

   They came here to freely exercise their religion. That is who
came here. And to see it all twisted in these ways through judicial
interpretation through the years is puzzling, a curious thing to me.
We have almost removed religion, certainly the establishment of re-
ligion. I think I understand that. But to remove these things in a--
well, enough. But that is a puzzler to me when we are the country
that was founded--the only one I know of founded on a belief in
God, and when all of its Founding Fathers were deeply committed
in almost elitist ways to worship. Interesting.

   You do not have any comment on that, do you? You are waiting
for more?

   Judge BREYER. NO, I understand this is an area--how the first
amendment is applied in this area is a matter of great contention
legally. But I do not think it is contentious, and I think the vast
majority of people, I think there is a kind of consensus that that
first amendment--it is not my opinion. I think there is a consensus
opinion that that first amendment protects the right of people to
pass their religion on to their children, and the home school situa-
tion on its face seems to fall within that. Therefore, I think there
is a consensus. Not my personal opinion but a consensus that some
protection is offered there.

   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I thank you.
   In response to the question on judicial activism in the committee
questionnaire, you said, among other things:
                                         350

  One must recognize that legislators and executive entities have sometimes failed
to address problems until constitutional violation resulted. It would be vastly pref-
erable for all branches of Government and for the public if the political branches
were able to resolve such issues and render their determination through judicial ad-
judication unnecessary.

  Then you also noted that:

  If the legislature or the executive either acts or fails to act in a manner that re-
sults in a violation of individual rights, the Court's role must include the difficult
and sensitive task of defining an appropriate judicial remedy.

  Could you share, if you would, what are some of those issues
which have not been resolved by the executive or legislative
branches which, in your view, the judicial branch has had to re-
solve through judicial adjudication? Are there any such issues or
problems before us today for which the judicial branch might be
called upon to define an appropriate judicial remedy due to present
and historical inaction by the executive and legislative branches?

  Judge BREYER. It is certainly true, Senator, that Congress gets
advice from all kinds of people, everybody in the country, including
judges, including policymakers, including dozens of others, and it
is up to Congress to decide, the legislature, what to do. So, there-
fore, I would stick to a historical example. The one that most obvi-
ously comes to mind is: Wouldn't it have been a wonderful thing,
in my mind, if sometime around the year 1870, 1880, 1885, 1890,
any time before 1954, that Congress had decided to enact laws that
made that promise of fairness in the 14th amendment a real thing?
How wonderful that would have been. And yet there was not that
law.

  I think in 1954 the Court said that promise will be made a re-
ality, and it has been a very difficult thing, but an ultimately criti-
cal thing, that that become real. I can hardly think of all our coun-
try's problems--and there are so many, whether you start with vio-
lence, or hunger, or children, or reading, or anything. Right there
at the top of that list is the need to make that promise a reality.
And that is hard.

  So I think the courts began that in 1954, and I know Congress
has stepped in, and I just wish, wouldn't it have been wonderful
if that had been done earlier.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I remember Justice Brennan, in visits
with him, and Justice Burger, I was fortunate to come to know
both of them personally. Wonderful men. And they would both say,
in rather remarkably guarded ways: When will you people begin to
do something about illegal immigration? This is when the commis-
sion started back in the early 1980's because the court cases were
coming in. The Texas case; you had to educate the children of an
illegal, undocumented person because you couldn't visit the sins of
the parent upon the child, and that child was entitled to an edu-
cation, and is. So that was a gentle goading from the other side of
the triangle of our constitutional government, like: Don't you think
you ought to get busy with something? And I remember we did get
busy, and we did a bill, and eventually dealt with that in a way
which we will have to revisit.

  But one final question, and then I will yield back the balance of
my time. A continuing aspect of the game in these Supreme Court
nominations is the committee's efforts to learn or try to learn a
                                      351
nominee's position on one legal issue or another, countered by the
nominee's efforts to avoid disclosing where he or she stands on spe-
cific issues. This is our ritual.

  We say we need to know in order to assure ourselves and the
Senate that the nominee is within "the mainstream" of legal
thought. That was a phrase that we heard during these latter
years, "the mainstream." The nominees argue that it would be in-
appropriate, if not wholly improper, to indicate where a prospective
Justice stands on a particular issue which may come before the
Court on which the nominee hopes to sit. But if the nominee has
written or spoken on an issue, it is often rather difficult for him
or her to duck that issue at the confirmation hearings.

  The exceedingly bright and able Judge Bork had written and spo-
ken extensively. He had done 106 opinions. None of them had been
overruled. And six of his dissents became majority opinions of the
U.S. Supreme Court. But before my eyes, the nomination process
turned him into a lot different guy than that.

  That was a painful thing, and I would not want to revisit any
of it. And there have been others just as painful.

  But as a result, with him we had a lengthy and wide-ranging,
free-range discussion of his views on many constitutional issues
during his hearings, and that is reported historically that that
might have hurt him badly.

  Justice Scalia handled it quite differently. He declined to respond
to most questions on current constitutional questions, a man of
similar brightness and ability as Judge Bork or as you. He felt it
inappropriate, and said it clearly, to discuss legal issues that are,
to use your words, I think the other morning, "up in the air," issues
that are still "up in the air."

  Now, however, my question: Justice Scalia was recently reported,
at least reported--I never really believe everything the fourth es-
tate says because I think they blur journalism with divinity. There
will be a report on that now that I have done something ugly and
quite evil with them, but line them up in the other alley because
we will do it again.

  Now, Justice Scalia recently is reported to have suggested that
caning might pass constitutional muster. I do not know that. In the
last year, Justice Blackmun announced to the country his position
on the death penalty. Now, other sitting judges, Justices, have
made statements disclosing their position on various controversial
issues, and without necessarily commenting on the behavior of any
particular Justice or nominee or yourself, do you see any valid rea-
son why a Supreme Court nominee should be less forthcoming than
a sitting Justice about his or her views? I am not going to ask you
about a view, but should they be less forthcoming about his or her
views on constitutional jurisprudence during confirmation hearings
than he or she might be after becoming a sitting Justice, other
than wanting very much to obtain the job? Would not the public
perception of bias be just as applicable to a sitting Justice as to a
nominee?

  Judge BREYER. YOU are asking me if I can think quickly of a dis-
tinction, and obviously I cannot. But, nonetheless, I think what is
important, which is what I have tried to do, is to expose to you how
I might go about thinking and dealing with a problem.
                                               352

  What the basic view is, how I see things basically, the reason,
as I see it, for hesitating to go into--there are three, really--to go
into something that is going to be a specific case, the best reason,
which is usually the true reason, is that I have not thought about
it in that kind of depth, and I should not go say something that
I have not thought about that is likely to come up in the context
of a particular case. That is always true.

  A second reason is, even if you think you have thought about it,
how often it really is true that I think I know something, I think
I have thought it through, and then a real case comes along--
maybe it is like a vote. I do not know if it is or not, but suddenly
it is real. Suddenly you really know that people's lives turn on it.
And that produces a tremendous degree of concentration that
might previously have been lacking.

  You read the briefs, and you understand the full facts, and that
is not true in a context before it becomes real. And of course, the
third reason is that you want to impress upon people that you will
be fair and openminded in a particular case, and decide on the
basis of briefs and arguments and thought at the time.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think it is important for Supreme Court
Justices and Justices in the State Supreme Courts to interact with
the public, to let them know that there is not just mystery coming
down from on high. Do you feel that way?

  Judge BREYER. Yes; there are many, many ways of interacting.
In my career, I have written quite a lot, and I have gone to bar
meetings, and I have gone around and talked to people. It is not
secret. It is not--there should be this interaction, and trying to
work out how you do the interaction, what is going to far, what you
can say, what precisely the boundaries are in terms of policy issues
relating to courts, and all the different things I might have taught
about or whatever--that is difficult. There are no easy answers to
those things, but the need to get out and communicate, I have al-
ways felt strongly; I have tried to build a career that reflects that.
I do not guarantee I have always drawn the line correct, but that

  Senator SIMPSON. Will you hope to be able to continue to do that?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I do.
  Senator SIMPSON. And you will do that.
  Judge BREYER. Every instinct I have cuts in that direction.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think it would be very important.
  Judge BREYER. I will be careful. I would be careful if I am con-
firmed.
  Senator SIMPSON. Oh, yes, you will. They will be watching. They
will not be watching for the good things you are saying; it will be
as you dibble around the edges. But I remember Justice Burger. He
would speak about advertising of lawyers, go to forums, lay it on
the line. I remember his great phrase he had, with regard to court-
appointed attorneys and people who were not prepared in court,
that we had 747 litigation and Piper Cub lawyers. That was con-
troversial.
  I think it is very important for judges to speak out, let them
know that they are not just there to please those who are engaged
in Elysian mysteries. And I said when we started that, knowing
you as I do, you will not give them legal mumbo-jumbo. You will
                                      353

give them justice and understanding, in English, of what it is you
have done. Is that your hope?

  Judge BREYER. I certainly hope so.
  Senator SIMPSON. It is mine, too, and I know you will, from my
knowledge of you.
  I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I have further questions; I am
just going to submit those in writing, if I may.
  Thank you for your courtesies and your manner in conducting
the hearing.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. He likes judges that are controver-
sial, but that is easy for a man who never has known controversy
to say that. If you had a little controversy, political controversy,
you might not encourage him so much to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. It takes one to know one, my friend. You have
been there.

sponses follow:]

                                        QUESTIONS FOR JUDGE BREYER

                                SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSON

                                                      JULY 14, 1994

   1. I am asking this question at the request of Senator Warner.
  A number of Senator Warner's constituents have called and written asking what
are your views of "home schooling" and "private religious schools." This week you
addressed some testimony to these issues. Senator Warner has asked me to give you
the attached op-ed piece from the July 13 Virginia Pilot written by Michael Farris,
who is the president and founder of the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense
Association, for you review.
   Specifically, in the case of New Life Baptist Church Academy v. Town of East
Longmeadow, the District Court had ruled that it was a violation of the First
Amendment for the public school district to evaluate teachers and curriculum in the
New Life Baptist Church Academy, a "private religious school."
   You reversed the lower court's decision on September 7, 1989. This raises con-
cerns with not only those whose children are home schooled or in private religious
schools, but also for others who are committed to a strict interpretation of the First
Amendment.
   Judge Breyer, what assurances can Senator Warner give his constituents about
your views on "private religious schools" and the protection afforded these institu-
tions in the First Amendment?
   And, religion aside, what protection does the Constitution offer to those parents
who wish to teach their children at home?
   2. What do you think of the efficacy of state medical malpractice and product li-
ability tort laws in the following areas:
   (a) compensating people who have been injured or killed by corporate or profes-
sional negligence;
   (b) deterring the marketing of unsafe products and the practice of substandard
medical care; and
   (c) alerting state and federal health and safety agencies to information that en-
ables them to perform their generalized duties?
   3. What are your views on the preemption of state tort laws through a federal
statute1 that does not confer federal question jurisdiction over tort lawsuits?
   In other words, do you think it is wise for Congress to pass a federal law to gov-
ern product liability or medical malpractice lawsuits that are brought in state courts
under state common and statutory law?

   1 S . 687, which was recently defeated on the Senate Floor, would have preempted state prod-
uct liability laws with a statute that would be interpreted by 30 different state court systems.

                                            JUDGE BREYER'S RESPONSES

                                                                                                        JULY 18, 1994.

Senator ALAN K. SIMPSON,

261 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.

  DEAR SENATOR SIMPSON: Thank you for your additional questions dated July 14,
1994. I am pleased to offer the following responses to your inquiry.

   1. Home Schooling. Many years ago, in the cases of Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S.
390 (1923), and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), the Supreme Court
made clear that the "liberty" guarantee of the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment ensures parents' right to "direct the upbringing and education of chil-
dren under their control." 268 U.S. at 534-35. The Court reaffirmed the existence
of that right in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965). That basic guar-
antee of liberty protects parents who are not motivated by religious considerations
as well as those who are. Thus it is well-established law that the Constitution offers
protection independent of the Free Exercise Clause to parents in deciding how to
educate their children.

  At the same time, it is also well-established law that the state has a "compelling"
interest in making certain that its children receive an adequate secular education.
See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Voder, 406 U.S. 205, 213 (1972) ("There is no doubt as to the
power of the State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to im-
pose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education."); Meyer
v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. at 402 ("The power of the State of compel attendance at some
school and to make reasonable regulations for all schools * * * is not questioned.")

  In the case of New Life Baptist Church Academy v. Town of East Longmeadow,
885 F.2d 940 (1st Cir. 1989), the First Circuit was required to engage in a delicate
balance of those competing interests of parents and the state, and to ensure that
both interests were respected. The state laws at issue in New Life Baptist provided
that a local school commission must "approve" the quality of secular education (i.e.,
in nonreligious subjects) provided at private schools--religious and nonreligious
alike--in order for students of those schools to comply with the state's compulsory
school attendance laws. A unanimous panel, in a decision which I authored, upheld
the proposed approval process after ensuring that the state's regulation of private
secular education was "reasonable" and no more burdensome upon constitutional
protections afforded to private religious schools than necessary to serve the state's
interest.

  Several of my other opinions have recognized the importance of accommodating
religious beliefs and of guaranteeing parents' right to send their children to private
schools. See, e.g., Members of Jamestown School Committee v. Schmidt, 699 F.2d 1,
13 (1st Cir.) (Breyer, J., concurring) (states have latitude to provide services such
as bus transportation to children attending private religious schools so long as those
services are provided equally to public school students), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 851
(1983); see also Aman v. Handler, 653 F.2d 41 (1st Cir. 1981) (public university offi-
cials may not deny official recognition to religious student organizations simply be-
cause they disagree with the organizations' views); Alexander v. Trustees of Boston
University, 766 F.2d 630, 646 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (states must
tolerate deviations from regulations and statutes where doing so would further the
accommodation of sincere religious beliefs); Universidad Central de Bayamon v.
NLRB, 793 F.2d 383 (1st Cir. 1986) (en bano) (faculty hiring by church-operated
universities should be exempt from the National Labor Relations Act).

  I might add that the test our court applied in New Life Baptist might be viewed
as more protective of the free exercise of religion than the test later adopted by the
Supreme Court in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon
v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), and far closer to the test that Congress recently en-
acted into law in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

  2. State Medical Malpractice and Product Liability Tort Laws. The efficacy and
wisdom of state medical malpractice and product liability tort laws is a highly con-
troversial issue currently the subject of extensive legislative debate at both the state
and federal levels. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on essentially legis-
lative judgments. As a judge, I would enforce any constitutional federal legislation
enacted in the area.

  3. Preemption of State Tort Laws. The wisdom of enactment of a federal law to
govern state product liability or medical malpractice lawsuits is likewise a legisla-
tive determination that is currently the subject of extensive debate. As a judge, I
would enforce any federal legislation enacted in the areas that is in accord with the
Constitution.

  Thank you for your inquiry. My best wishes.
       Sincerely,

                                                                                                 STEPHEN G. BREYER.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  As we know, a vote has just started in the last few minutes, and
so I will not have the time to do a number of the questions I had
wanted.
  Judge Breyer, you are the first nominee in the nearly 20 years
I have been here that I have not been able to be here for every
word of your testimony, and I apologize for that. Unfortunately,
something that I had absolutely no control over, the foreign oper-
ations bill, was on the floor, and as we have in the last number
of years, we have done both our authorizing and appropriating in
the same bill. I am the manager of that bill, so I have been stuck
there.
  I had a lot of followup questions from your earlier responses. I
was impressed with your answers, but I was also impressed earlier
that on a number of my questions, very artfully, you did not go into
a full answer. I understand some of your reasons, but I would like
to follow up on a couple of those questions.
  One answer in your discussion with Senator Simpson made me
think of this question. You have talked of the ninth amendment.
You have talked of unenumerated rights. You and I had a discus-
sion of Justice Goldberg's decisions. But as I recall from my notes,
after you noted that the ninth amendment protected unenumerated
rights, as well as noting that a right to privacy is well-settled, you
said that what these enumerated rights "are and how you find
them is a big question." I would agree with that. You said you
looked for a reference to liberty in the 14th amendment, and as I
have read the transcript of your testimony in the evening, you have
talked about the dignity of the person during the last couple days.
Is that your way of articulating an unenumerated constitutional
guarantee?
  Judge BREYER. The ninth amendment, to Justice Goldberg, and
I think to many others, makes clear that fact that certain rights
are listed does not mean there are not others. Then the 14th
amendment takes the word "liberty," and the question that you ask
is, well, if there are others, how do we know what they are.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you find them--where do you find them?
  Judge BREYER. And what you have suggested is of course, you
start with the text, and then you look back to history, and you look
back to what the Framers thought. But so often, you cannot--what
the Framers thought is that the Constitution should adapt, pre-
serving certain basic values. So, what are those values? And we are
back to where we started with a historic approach. We are back to
where we started.
  I think the word "dignity" is important. At the most basic level,
the Preamble to the Constitution lists what the Framers were up
to--establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
  Liberties are then listed, some, and underlying things like free
speech and free religion, as I described or discussed when I talked
about my own family, listening, is an idea, in my mind, of dignity.
                                      356
Freedom from search, unreasonable search, unreasonable seizures,
rights to fair trial, rights to speak and discuss, rights to express
oneself creatively, rights to practice one's own religion without in-
terference--all of those things have something to do with an indi-
vidual, a man, a woman, a family, being able to lead a certain kind
of life, to have a story to their life that is a story of a dignified life.
That means many decisions must be up to them, and not to be told
to them by the State. That, too, is why the Constitution, in my
opinion, originally started out as a Government--and remains--of
limited power.

  Now, you reserve the area of autonomy. You look back into his-
tory. You try to determine what are the basic values that underlay
those things that are enumerated, and that gives you a key to
other basic values. You look to what Frankfurter and Harlan and
Goldberg and others talked about as the traditions of our people,
always trying to understand what people historically have viewed
as traditional, and the values being there, you look to history in
the past, to history in the present, and to the meaning, to what life
is like today, to try to work out how--maybe an idea a little bit
into the future, too--to get an idea of what are those things that
are fundamental to a life of dignity.

  I know those are very general statements, but in working that
out with precedents and working that out in the context of the
Constitution, you look and see what judges have tried to do, and
you try to behave in that particular way.

  Senator LEAHY. But you had said--in the discussion with Sen-
ator Simpson a few minutes ago, you talked about--if I am quoting
you correctly--in the late 1800's, it would have been nice if the
Congress, the President, the political powers, had taken the steps
that the Supreme Court eventually did in 1954.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. And I agree with you. The fact is, of course, the
Congress did not, and in fact, the Congress probably would have
been divided enough even in 1954 that they would not have taken
those steps. The remarkable thing is that the Supreme Court did
it, and did it in a unanimous opinion--probably one of the greatest
gifts to our constitutional history and to the integrity of the Su-
preme Court that they were able to do that unanimously.
  But doesn't that mean that there are possibilities that the Court
steps in, basically making a political as well as a legal decision? Or,
another way of putting it--when we speak of these unenumerated
rights, do you accept that there may be a time in the future that
what the Court may see as unenumerated rights are, because of a
changing society, something different than we might see today?
  Judge BREYER. I do not think the values are different. I think
how they might apply might be.
  Senator LEAHY. But obviously, the Court--you go from Dred
Scott to Brown--I realize they are differing things--Plessy v. Fer-
guson, whatever--if you look at some of these decisions, you find
the Court certainly changes. We still have the same Constitution,
but the Court changes in how it sees rights.
  Judge BREYER. That, of course, is true. But what I think in my
own mind in respect to that particular opinion, Brown, surely,
every time I think about it--and you go back to the pre-Brown
                                               357

world--you can ask yourself how could people have looked at that
promise, which is a promise of fairness, and think of the dignity
that underlies so many of the first 10 amendments, and say we
have it? They did not have it. It seems so obvious that that was
not there that I think of Brown as an instance of applying law that
was there, that was clear--a promise of fairness to circumstances
where the fairness did not exist.

  And perhaps it is hindsight, but I would like to think that if I
had been there before, it would have been foresight. And I under-
stand that judges, like any human beings, can make mistakes and
get things wrong, but you would like to think that if you are get-
ting things right, you are referring back to the basic idea of values
that reflect human dignity, that underlie the Constitution because
they are necessary to assure the promise of the Preamble.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge Breyer, in many ways, it is with probably
as deep a regret as I think I have had on just about anything in
years, that now, with the clock down to where we have 5 or 6 min-
utes left in this vote, I am going to have to leave. I am also extraor-
dinarily disappointed that 20 years of precedent has broken with
you in that I have not been able to sit here for everything you have
had to say, because I would like to carry on this discussion a great
deal.

  You will be confirmed--we all know that--but I hope that you
and I might have the opportunity to continue this discussion, if not
in an on-the-record basis, in an off-the-record basis. And I hope--
and I will put my closing statement in the record--but I hope that
you will resist any pressure to become cloistered from the world.
I have spoken of judges being outside the judicial monastery. I
have a feeling that your wife and your children will, should you be-
come too cloistered, bring you back to reality rather quickly.

  Judge BREYER. That is true.
  Senator LEAHY. And I suspect your friends will. But you need
that. Every judge needs that. They need to go out--if somebody
says, "Wait a minute, that is baloney. Let me tell you why"--be-
cause just as we in the Senate do, where people do not want to talk
back to us, we need to go out and do it. I hope that you will do
that.
  I will leave one question for the record, and this is the one I real-
ly am sorry that I am not going to be able to have a discussion with
you. I would hope that you and I might perhaps some evening,
some day, have this discussion. II is a question I ask all nominees
to the Supreme Court, and that is: Since you left law school, or in
the space of your experience, what are some of the most significant
cases the Supreme Court has decided? Judge, I would ask you if
you might take a moment after to submit an answer for the record.
I am just curious, what are those things that stand out the most
in your mind as those cases that have had probably the greatest
impact from this unique and wonderful Court on which you are
about to serve; what are the ones that have had the most impact?
  And with that, seeing that we are voting right now, we will re-
cess, subject to the call of the Chair.
  Thank you.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.

  [Response of Judge Breyer and the prepared statement of Sen-
ator Leahy follow:]

                    JUDGE BREYER'S RESPONSE TO SENATOR LEAHY'S QUESTION

                                                       LEADING CASES

  In response to Senator Leahy's request that I identify Supreme Court cases of
particular importance decided since I graduated from law school, I am providing the
following list of decisions, the importance and wisdom of which are, in my judgment,
widely accepted.

   1. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964). This case redeemed the promise of our
democratic form of government by ensuring an equal vote for every citizen.

  2. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). While the exact contours of the right
against self-incrimination remain a subject of debate, Miranda established the basic
proposition that the Fifth Amendment would prevent the most serious abuses of offi-
cial power.

  3. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969). By reinvigorating the clear and
present danger test in a case involving the Ku Klux Klan, this decision affirmed the
fundamental principle that the First Amendment must protect even the speech we
hate.

  4. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), and Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190
(1976). These cases established the critical principle that the Fourteenth Amend-
ment's guarantees extend to gender discrimination.

  5. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 714 (1989). This decision is important not
so much for its specific subject matter (the Sentencing Commission) but more gen-
erally because it reintroduced needed flexibility into the constitutional separation-
of-powers analysis, ensuring that Congress and the President can meet new chal-
lenges to effective governance posed by complex modern problems.

                                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY

  Mr. Chairman, I conclude my round of questioning with these observations: I
want to commend my colleagues for their thoughtful participation in these most im-
portant proceedings and to commend Judge Breyer for the way he has conducted
himself and his willingness to reveal something of himself and his thinking.

  Quite frankly, I would have liked him to be even more forthcoming and specific
in his responses, but I acknowledge that the appropriate line is difficult to draw and
recognize that my frustration may reflect my own perspective as a Senator asking
questions.

  I have sensed through the course of these proceedings a disappointment among
some that there has not been more controversy surrounding this nomination, that
we have not had to endure a donnybrook or witness a wealth of political maneuver-
ing. I suggest, to the contrary, that we should take pride in what is transpiring
here: This is an occasion when all three branches of our Federal Government can
be seen working together smoothly and efficiently.

  I hope that the members of the public who have had an opportunity to join us
over the last few days either in person or to witness these proceedings on television
have taken something positive from them. I again commend President Clinton for
having chosen a nominee who can bring people of diverse political views together
and who has engendered such praise as an excellent choice.

  Finally, if I might, I say to you, Judge Breyer, that after you are confirmed I hope
that you will successfully resist the pressures to become cloistered away from the
world. I think that your involvement with your family, demonstrated throughout
these hearings, provides some protection for you. I doubt that your active wife and
children are going to allow you to lose touch.

  In your opening statement and your answers over these last three days you have
indicated your intention always to remember the effects that your decisions will
have on real people--people who may not be powerful or well-connected. You have
demonstrated that you have not only mastered the complexities of the law but are
the fulfillment of your parents' influences toward public service and to awareness
of the impact your work will have on the lives of others.

  So I urge you even while sitting on the High Court to be of the world. I do not
suggest that you tailor your opinions to the winds of public opinion. Rather, I urge
you to remember that you have learned about government and people. I call upon
you to fulfill the promise you made to the American people as these proceedings
began--to remember that the decisions you help to make will have an enormous ef-
fect upon the lives of many, many Americans and to do your utmost to see that
                                      359

those decisions reflect both the letter and the spirit of law that is meant to help
them.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you.
  We went through legislative history, and I want to go back to
legislative history, but not in the general way I did the first time.
I will be a little more specific this time. I am somewhat concerned
about some of the answers you gave me about statutory construc-
tion yesterday--or, I guess it was 2 days ago, now. In light of that,
I want to ask you about your 1992 decision in Paleo.
  Paleo, for the benefit of those who do not know, had been con-
victed of four violent crimes, and under Federal law, a person with
three or more violent crime convictions who possesses a firearm--
and that is a very important ingredient--faces a 15-year manda-
tory minimum sentence. Paleo, as you recall, argued that the man-
datory minimum sentencing provisions did not apply to him be-
cause he claimed that three of his convictions were constitutionally
invalid. You ruled that the statute required that the criminal be al-
lowed to challenge his prior convictions in Federal court.
  Last May 23, this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Custis that
the same statute did not permit the defendant to challenge his con-
viction prior to sentencing. So I want to kind of compare your opin-
ion with the Supreme Court's.
  For instance, the Supreme Court interpreted the key terms in
the statute--three words--"three previous convictions"--according
to the statute's very plain language. In other words, as I would
read it, someone who has three previous convictions has in fact
three previous convictions.
  Now, in contrast, I think your opinion did not follow the plain
language, and you did not identify any compelling legislative his-
tory to justify your departing from the plain language. I think that
you interpreted the statute according to what interest you believed
the Government had in the operation of the statute, and you wrote
that:

  The Federal Government has no recognizable interest in imprisoning a defendant
on the basis of convictions that are constitutionally invalid.

  I suppose that your approach would be an example--and even
beyond you, I suppose--of a judge who would use a style of statu-
tory construction that would give me some concern. I am concerned
that such a judge might in fact be what I do not like, a kind of ac-
tivist-type judge who wants to put his own ideological imprint on
something, because often, activists narrowly define the Govern-
ment's interest at stake to rule against the Government.

  It seems to me that the Government's interest is having its stat-
utes enforced according to their plain terms and in getting dan-
gerous criminals locked up for long, long periods of time.

  I want to know why you interpreted the statute according to
what I see as being maybe your own views, instead of the Govern-
ment's interest, since you did not quote any legislative history. You
applied your view of the Government's interest, instead of what I
see as very, very plain language of the statute.
                                              360

  Judge BREYER. A difficult case. I think that if in fact I could have
read the statute, "three prior convictions," to mean what you say--
three prior convictions--the case would have been much easier.

  The problem in the case arose from the fact that you could not
read it that way because the Supreme Court had said at least some
of those things that say convictions are not convictions.

  They had said, for example, that one of those previous convic-
tions was a conviction that was obtained without the person having
a lawyer; then, it is not a conviction, even though it says "convic-
tion."

   So the dilemma--and this is why it was so very difficult--is it
assumed by everybody, everybody agrees, that you cannot just read
"conviction" to mean conviction. Certain ones do not count. Those
without a lawyer, for example, do not count. And now the question
is are there some other ones that do not count. And the simplest
thing seemed to me to be to say those that are unconstitutional do
not count, because if you do not do it that way, you would have to
say there are some unconstitutional convictions which are convic-
tions, and there are other unconstitutional convictions--those with-
out a lawyer--which are not convictions. And I did not understand
how to draw that distinction.

  On the other side of it was if you take the approach I just said,
won't it become very, very difficult for judges to work at sentencing
hearings? Won't people challenge it all the time? And what you
have in so many of these cases which was present there is you
have some very strong policy reasons, which policy reasons are a
key to try to understand how Congress would have wanted a stat-
ute interpreted where the language cannot be read literally, and
where there is no legislative history. And where there is not, I am
trying to put myself in the shoes of a person in Congress who has
an objective, who is faced with the same kind of interpretive dif-
ficulties that I would be faced with.

  The Supreme Court went along with the opposite approach, I
guess, which is that it is better to say there are different kinds of
unconstitutional convictions, and some of them count, and some of
them do not count. That is a reasonable view, too, and I did decide
it the other way, and they are authoritative.

   But I do not think one view or the other is more or less a depar-
ture from the statute. I think in both instances, what you are try-
ing to do is interpret a statute in conditions where it cannot be
read just literally because of the circumstance I mentioned.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, could I ask you if, given what you know
about the Supreme Court's opinion in that Custis case, would you
have decided the Paleo case differently, either in terms of results
or reasoning?

  Judge BREYER. It would have had to come out the other way, in
my opinion. I know there are some distinctions. We actually--the
decision in Paleo was a very close, very difficult decision that we
debated quite a lot, and I do not like to give a legal opinion, and
so you are getting an off-the-cuff response to the Supreme Court,
putting myself back, and most of the lawyers, I think, and the
judges in our circuit would say that the recent Supreme Court
opinion suggests it should have come out the other way. I do not
make that statement definitely, but
                                      361
  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me contrast your opinion with the Su-
preme Court's decision--and then ask you to react to that.
  The Supreme Court did not find that the statute contemplates
that defendants could challenge their prior sentences. They pointed
out that another provision of the same statute says that a Federal
court cannot count a conviction "which has been set aside." To me,
this surely means that the defendant's convictions that have not
been set aside will be counted as the three strikes for an enhanced
sentence. And the Court analyzed other statutes that provided spe-
cific procedures for challenging the validity of prior convictions
used to enhance sentences. So Congress has drafted clearly in this
area, both when we want to allow challenged convictions and when
we do not.
  The Court also cited a 1980 Supreme Court case, interpreting a
prior version of the same statute to disallow challenges to convic-
tions. So then, that would lead me to ask why you did not consider
the other portions of the statute--or other statutes where Congress
expressly permitted defendants to challenge their convictions, or
even this 1980 Supreme Court case.
  Judge BREYER. I think that is all there, Senator, and I think that
what I am trying to do and I think most of us in the judiciary
would try to do is to try to work out what the intention of the Con-
gress is. The question that was a stumbling block for me and is in
the Supreme Court opinion that you read is, well, prior precedent
of the Supreme Court--which, by the way, they are free to modify
or interpret. We are not free to modify or interpret. Prior precedent
of the Supreme Court said that the defendant could challenge some
prior convictions; for example, convictions that were obtained with-
out a lawyer.
  That being so, what is the rule as to when a prior conviction
could be challenged and when it could not? Are there different cat-
egories of constitutional violation? Are some more important than
others? I cannot answer that question as a lower court judge.
  Looking at precedent when I looked at it, I found that there, and
whether I was right or wrong, I thought that was a major stum-
bling block to the interpretation that the later court came up with.
That was my thinking at the time, and that is what I tried to ex-
press in that opinion.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Paleo is about ineffective assistance from a
lawyer as opposed to the denial of a lawyer.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, exactly. Exactly.
  Senator GRASSLEY. And that is what Custis is about.
  Judge BREYER. Exactly; and the Court, the Supreme Court has
the power to say, look, there are differences in a conviction being
unconstitutional because the person did not have a lawyer and a
conviction being unconstitutional because he did have a lawyer and
the lawyer acted ineffectively. The Supreme Court has the power
to say those are two different things.
  As I interpreted it at the time, I did not see how to say that they
were two different things, that they were different kinds of con-
stitutional violation. I recognize the argument. You had to do it one
way or the other. You had to say there are different kinds, or you
had to create the procedural problem. And I thought more closely--
                                               362

to the intent of Congress was the way I decided it, and the Su-
preme Court said later, no, it was the other way.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I guess I will move on. I would just like to
leave a message with you. That would be in regard to the fact that
we are now working on a crime bill where we hope to make very
clear, three strikes and you are out, three prior convictions and you
are out. And maybe what you are saying is we have not done it
plain enough in the past. I think we have. I think the Supreme
Court has differentiated enough, and I guess maybe I would just,
based upon the Paleo case, ask you to take a view at whether or
not we were clear enough in this instance.

  There was a recent column by William Raspberry in the Wash-
ington Post. After surveying various studies, Mr. Raspberry has
come to a conclusion that the most effective antipoverty activities
are provided by religious institutions. He finds that church-based
drug rehabilitation and antiviolence programs are more effective
than others.

  However, he is concerned that the establishment clause, that the
Supreme Court has found blocks almost all public funding for paro-
chial schools, might also be interpreted to bar aid to these very suc-
cessful church-based antipoverty programs.

  I hope I do not have to say that I respect separation of church
and state, but I also believe that what the establishment clause de-
mands is neutrality toward religion. And I think a little bit along
the lines of Senator Brown. I think that when the Government goes
too far in avoiding religious issues, sometimes you can have gov-
ernment promoting secularism. I do not try to convince you that
that can be a form of religion, but it seems to me the absence of
religion is something we have to be concerned about in a society
that has a moral basis for our existence.

  I think that you may also agree with what I just said about neu-
trality toward religion based on a 1989 decision of yours involving
busing of parochial school students. The Government need not be
hostile to religion to comply with the first amendment. It need not
aid all antipoverty organizations except church-based ones.

  Can't Congress, consistent with the establishment clause, pursue
the secular objective of trying to eliminate drug use and violent be-
havior and poverty by neutrally aiding a whole range of entities
that have programs in these areas, including religious organiza-
tions?

  Judge BREYER. There are areas, vast areas, as I really said yes-
terday and the day before and would say the same tomorrow and
every other day, that there are vast areas where it is obvious that
churches receive assistance from the Government. The area of so-
cial services, the area of fire departments is the obvious example
I use, but there are many others. And there are tax exemptions--
tax exemptions aimed at religious institutions. And there are var-
ious busing, as in the opinion that you read. And the difficult ques-
tion, when you say neutrality, of course, immediately that is fine.
In the context of any individual program, what happens when
there is a challenge in court is someone says, yes, we understand
that; yes, you are absolutely right. But this particular one goes too
far.
                                             363

  Then what you have in a court case is the issue about whether
this is or is not going too far. And what I can say is I consider
those open-mindedly. You understand from my opinions in this
area that I have a practical bent of mind to see if it really is going
too far, not some theory, and that I will try to decide those cases
in that light.

   Senator GRASSLEY. In deciding establishment clause cases, do
you see yourself being more inclined to fine tuning as opposed to
making sweeping changes?

  Judge BREYER. It sounds to me most of these cases that have
come along have been involved in line-drawing, and is it really
going too far up here, or is it not quite far enough? Is this too far
or isn't it? That is my impression of most of what comes up in re-
cent years in this area.

   I cannot promise there will not be major cases that come up. Ob-
viously, there may be.

   Senator GRASSLEY. I have a question about our jury system. A
number of recent criminal trials have garnered huge amounts of
publicity, as you know. They also share something else in common.
It seems like whether it is the Menendez brothers or whether it is
John and Lorena Bobbitt or the police attackers of Rodney King or
the attackers of the truck driver, Reginald Denny, the defendant
was either acquitted outright or acquitted of all really serious
charges.

   Now, remarkably, this occurred in this last instance, in the case
of Denny, despite the fact that that was captured on TV videotape.

   Do you now believe that the jury system functions as well as in
criminal trials as it has in the past? And do you have any sugges-
tions about how to improve the function of criminal juries?

   Judge BREYER. It is interesting. Of course, I am not a trial judge,
but I talk to trial judges. And what is interesting to me when I talk
to trial judges is the enormous faith that they have in the jury sys-
tem. And again and again they will say, particularly in criminal
trials--it is very interesting because at lunch we discuss this every
so often. And in the district court in Massachusetts, the judges that
I usually have lunch with, you know, quite often, they say it works.
It works, again and again. And I do not promise you--and no one
would--that it always works, that it works perfectly. But you do
discover a tremendous sincere belief on the part of judges over and
over in the value of the that system, that it does basically work
pretty well. The jurors are admirable in contributing that time and
effort.

   So I know that people, thoughtful people like you and me, I hope,
and many, many others, are concerned with the way in which the
right to fair trials interacts with the free press right. But the basic
idea of the jury and the way it is working, my sense is among peo-
ple who deal with it, they think it works.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Even though it is working somewhat dif-
ferently in recent years than maybe it has historically, I do not
think there is anything basically wrong with it. It was meant to
have the opinion of the community invplved in the determining of
justice.

   But I think there is something disturbing about the last 30
years. It seems like society has been less willing to hold people re-
                                               364

sponsible for their actions in general. This is particularly true con-
cerning crimes. What were once poor excuses are now frequently
accepted as justification for finding the perpetrator to be a victim.
Additionally, it seems like respect for all of our societal institu-
tions, whether it be Mom and Dad in the home or our schools and
the teachers in those schools or our churches and synagogues and
the pastors and the priests and the rabbis connected with them, as
well as even law enforcement, the respect that they used to have,
it seems to me, has eroded greatly in the years. And the criminal
justice process, the laws and the judges' instructions are not im-
mune from these trends. I think maybe we are seeing some of this
reflected there, especially since the jury was designed to reflect
community sentiment. It might be reflected there like it is in other
places.

  What suggestion would you have for those of us in the legislative
branch who believe that we have got to stop blaming society when
an individual commits a crime, and make people realize that they
have to be responsible for their actions? And how do you suggest
we restore respect for institutions, including our criminal justice
system that sometimes loses respect when it looks obvious to the
public at large somebody is guilty and they get off?

  Judge BREYER. Of course, I agree that the trust problem is amaz-
ing. It is an amazingly big problem for institutions.

  In the particular area that you are talking about, what I have
said publicly--I hope it is not overly optimistic; many would think
it is--is that not all the solutions are legislative; that if, in fact,
you get members of the bar who are interested in criminal defense
work as well as those interested in prosecutions, and members of
the press, and they get a sense of what each other's problems and
responsibilities and so forth are, very often some of the things that
you are concerned about that interfere with fair trials or whatever
can be ironed out outside of the legal system, outside of laws and
legislation, from people simply understanding the institutional
problems of the other.

  That is the kind of thing I have talked about. I think it is still
possible.

  Senator GRASSLEY. When you say you have talked about it, do
you mean publicly or privately?

  Judge BREYER. Publicly.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes, and do you do it with the intent of trying
to wake people up to the problem?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. And when you see these problems, do you see
yourself as a leader who ought to help direct public opinion to
maybe look inwardly and trying to solve them and not always solve
them through a government action?
  Judge BREYER. I hope so. We so see ourselves in our own institu-
tions. I so much see myself as a judge, and we become so narrow,
in a sense, not understanding not just the other person's point of
view but the institution in which they are working. I think that is
true of press and judges and everyone else. And conversation in an
effort to see the different perspective, that is what I have said pub-
licly.
                                               365

  I have tried to encourage that, and I would try to encourage it
still.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU served in a number of different positions
with the ABA, and you have done some of this since becoming a
Federal judge. You have served on a governing body of the Admin-
istrative Law Section. I believe you have been a vice chair of the
section's Judicial Review Committee.

  As I am sure you are aware, there is much controversy these
days about the role of the ABA. The ABA has deeply involved itself
in a number of controversial social and political issues. Through its
governing bodies, the ABA has taken positions relating to legisla-
tive matters such as abortion, civil rights, affirmative action, pa-
rental leave, the death penalty, gun control.

  Just this past week, the president of the ABA stated his support
for the Racial Justice Act, which, of course, right now has our
crime conference bogged down.

  The ABA has filed amicus briefs with Federal appellate courts,
including the Supreme Court, addressing employment discrimina-
tion, good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, capital punish-
ment for minors, and the constitutionality of the independent coun-
sel and legislative veto, and I suppose there are a lot of other
things.

  In light of the ABA's activity in policy areas, questions have
come up concerning the propriety of judicial participation in the or-
ganization. In fact, in 1991, an ABA commission of judges, includ-
ing four of your fellow Federal appellate colleagues, recommended
limitations on judicial activity within the ABA.

  Specifically, the commission suggested that judges be permitted
to join various ABA committees and sections only if all policy state-
ments and all briefs disclaimed that they reflect the views of its ju-
dicial members or that judges participated in the adoption of the
views.

  The commission also recommended that judges not participate in
formulating or adopting ABA policies concerning matters on which
the judge in his own name could not comment upon.

  Finally, the commission recommended that no judge occupy any
ABA position that would lead the public to associate that judge
with ABA policy even if the judge played no role relating to the
specific policy.

  These recommendations were developed in light of the Code of
Judicial Conduct. The code prohibits judges from taking stands on
controversial legal issues, from making statements that might im-
pair court proceedings, and from engaging in activities that might
require recusal because they call into question the judge's impar-
tiality.

  In light of this report of the ABA's own commission, are you con-
cerned about judicial participation in the ABA? And what role do
you intend to play in that organization if you are confirmed to the
Court?

  Judge BREYER. The approach of that report--I am not saying
that I agree with everything in that report, but the approach of
that report is an approach that I would call disclosure, and what
I would think would be clear to the public anyway. The Adminis-
trative Law Section of the American Bar Association has taken the
                                                366

positions that are controversial that you describe, and I think it
should be apparent through ABA policy that they are not speaking
for judges when they talk about something controversial that
judges have no business talking about.

  And in the Administrative Law Section, should something have
come up that I thought was something I should not express my
view upon as a judge, I would just say so, if it was not apparent
to everybody from the situation that that was the case.

  I would not like to see membership in that association by judges
discouraged. I do think it is so terribly important for judges to be
associated with members of the bar and to be able to have forums
where they can discuss problems of judging, the institution of judg-
ing, problems of the bar, problems of the litigants that lead to the
bar, having clients. All these matters are terribly important, in my
opinion, to discuss outside the pure ivory tower of the judiciary.

  And I see the American Bar Association as offering forums where
those kinds of discussions are encouraged and appropriate, and I
favor that.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Could you think of maybe one example of
where you have not associated yourself with or spoken a point of
view in the association since you have been a judge?

  Judge BREYER. There are things that come up. I think that
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU think there has been some time, when
you have not associated with the ABA's point of view?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, on the ABA, there would be in the council
in the Administrative Law Section, things would come up and I
would just say this, of course, doesn't include me. I can't pinpoint
it, but I do have a distinct recollection there have been such in-
stances.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Since crime has become a very serious con-
cern of so many communities around the country, and particularly
the increasingly violent and even the random nature of it, and the
fact that even a lot of young people are committing more crime and
even more serious crime, citizens of some of these communities
have tried to keep young people from joining gangs and/or commit-
ting crimes, and one method they have used has been to impose
curfews on youth.
  The Washington Post had a front-page story this week that re-
minded me of this, and they said almost 1,000 jurisdictions across
the country have done this. The curfew reflects a belief that, after
a certain hour, it is important that kids be at home, not hanging
around the streets without supervision and, in the process, being
exposed to very dangerous situations.
  Some communities interested in enacting such curfews have been
discouraged from doing so, because of concerns regarding the first
amendment. Indeed, some judges who usually live in the commu-
nities, totally isolated from the crime-ridden world, as they do,
have found some curfews unconstitutional. That is not meant to be
derogatory, but I presume most judges don't live in crime-ridden
areas.
  It seems to me that the case law is quite clear that children do
not have the same constitutional rights as adults, and it also seems
to me that the interest of keeping children from being in situations
where they can be recruited to commit crimes, where they actually
                                               367

commit crimes, and where they are victimized by crime is a very
compelling argument for curfew. If local communities want to do it,
we should let them do it.

  I know you cannot express your views on specific language of any
specific curfew, because you might be dealing with that. But what
are your general views about whether the first amendment pre-
vents communities from imposing curfews on juveniles?

  Judge BREYER. I know your general statement that a child is dif-
ferent and in need of greater protection is correct, it is an impor-
tant interest. There are circumstances in which curfews, I am sure,
are normal in various circumstances in which they have been
upheld.

  The constitutional argument which you say is being made means
that I have to be cautious, because I would absolutely want to ap-
proach that with an open mind, and so it is hard for me to go fur-
ther into that. The interests that you identify, I am absolutely cer-
tain are there. In other words, I can't easily discuss this, as you
say, which is totally true, that it is likely to be the subject of a
case.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I do not have another ques-
tion, but I would like to take 2 minutes to do a Metzenbaum and
just ask him to consider something.

  The CHAIRMAN. I think everyone is entitled to be a Metzenbaum
at least one time in their life. I am a Metzenbaum today. That is
why I am wearing this tie. [Laughter.]

  While you are preparing your question, I should point out that
a number of press have asked me about this tie. This tie is a con-
sequence of some of my colleagues in the Senate, particularly the
Senator from the State of Washington, Patty Murray, walking up
to me and looking at me and saying, "Joe, I must tell you, you are
very dull," and then saying, why couldn't I be more like Howard
Metzenbaum.

  Now, I have been here a long time and this is the first time any-
one has said that to me, and so I went out and got a Metzenbaum
tie. So you can ask a Metzenbaum question.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I am not sure your tie is protected by
the first amendment. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. They are cartoon characters, for the record.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yesterday, we discussed the Supreme Court's
decision on illegitimacy, and I appreciate what you said, that you
would keep an open mind, if someone asked the Court to overrule
those decisions, in light of the changes in our factual under-
pinnings that have occurred over the last three decades.
  Throughout its history, the Supreme Court has overruled con-
stitutional decisions. Since the 1960's, the Court has overruled, I
think, more than 160 constitutional decisions. This has occurred, in
the words of Justice Brandeis, who, of course, was 40 years before
that, because, "Not only the decisions of the fact have been ren-
dered upon an inadequate presentation of then existing conditions,
but the conditions may have changed meanwhile. Moreover," he
continues, "the judgment of the Court in the earlier decisions may
have been influenced by prevailing views as to the economic or so-
cial policy, which have since been abandoned."
                                               368

  Now, it is one thing for the Supreme Court to overturn decisions
which were always contrary to the original meaning of the Con-
stitution and which were based on faulty social theory, as I think
these illegitimacy cases were. In hindsight, the Court's theory of so-
cial engineering that its decisions would not increase illegitimacy
have turned out to be wrong statistically, as well as practically. We
see it every day.

  It is quite another thing to say that the meaning of the Constitu-
tion changes as society changes. That view suggests that Justices
conduct an ongoing constitutional convention in which the law is
made up as the judges go along. Overruling decisions that were
never true to the Constitution in the first place is, as you under-
stand, a judicial obligation. But the Constitution is not up for grabs
with every case. Changed circumstances permit judges to justify
and to change the application of the constitutional provisions.
Changed circumstances do not change the core meaning of the pro-
vision. The latter belief makes it too easy for judges to enshrine
their own personal prejudices into constitutional law.

  So that is what I submit happens and did happen in some of
these illegitimacy cases, and we have had terribly disastrous re-
sults for our country, and there is bipartisan unanimity on it. And
if the President speaks in the State of the Union Message saying
that we have got to do something about the illegitimacy problem,
you know it is bad.

  So I hope that if you are confirmed to the Supreme Court, that
you would keep this distinction in mind between what is the basic
Constitution as what is the application of those principles to the
things of the day.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Now we are going to move to Senator Heflin. Again, let me make
it clear that it is 5 o'clock, but we are finishing tonight. So I would
ask staff to let their principals know that if they have questions,
please be ready to ask. I see two other of my colleagues are here
prepared to go, but I want all the staff to know that we will finish
with the witness tonight.
  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge, in an article entitled "The Regulation of
Genetic Engineering," you argue that the Government should re-
frain from the regulation of genetic engineering. In your article,
you reference the existence of strong natural forces that tend to
contain and reverse undesirable practices in connection with ge-
netic engineering.
  Would you say that these strong and natural forces govern the
field of bioethics generally?
  Judge BREYER. That, Senator, was a brief article years and years
ago. I think it was written at a time--I don't know much about ge-
netic engineering now, and I can say I knew less then--it was as
time when people didn't know a lot about it. And I think the thrust
of that was get to the scientists and find out what is really happen-
ing before you enact specific legislation. I think that was the thrust
of the article.
  I think since that time there have been programs in the legisla-
tures, in statutes. I think that the executive branch has acted in
                                      369
a variety of ways to try to assure adequate protection in that area,
like others.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, are you skeptical of the efficacy of govern-
mental intervention in bioethical issues?

  Judge BREYER. NO; it would depend on what it was. The ethical
issues are very, very important, very important. If I am remember-
ing correctly, one way in which some of those issues--I think Pro-
fessor Freund wrote an article suggesting you try to get members
of the community--doctors, ministers, and others--into groups that
can jointly work out the way of dealing with some of these implica-
tions and problems. That kind of approach, too, not necessarily the
only approach, but that can be a possible approach.

  Senator HEFLIN. I think it becomes pretty clear that you try to
pattern your thoughts in some organized fashion, and the word
"technocrat" has been frequently used in descriptions about you. I
know that technical approach has sometimes been criticized. I
think Cardozo once warned of judges who become pharmacists, on
the idea that they were unduly fond of neat formulas in which they
separated the cases and they separated their thinking. Do you have
any feeling that you are unduly a technocrat?

  Judge BREYER. I hope not. I hope what I am doing is using the
technical part to try to uncover the human purpose that we are try-
ing to help. Airline, et cetera, that was technical, you can say, but
they are real human beings who couldn't afford to fly, and those
real human beings have benefited, if it is a lower electricity rate,
it is a lower air fare. All these technical things have to do with real
people and may affect their lives a lot.

  I plead guilty to a dry style of writing. That is to say when I
wrote this book on regulation, the object of which, of course, was
to produce a style of regulation that would be effective and that
would help people. The Los Angeles Times, in reviewing that,
said--I don't know how the Los Angeles Times was reviewing a
technical book, but they did, and they said, well, Alice, when she
emerged from the pool of tears in "Alice in Wonderland," turned to
the door mouse, who was reading Hume's "History of England."
"Why are you reading that," said Alice. "We are all wet," said the
door mouse, "and this is the driest thing I know." That was before,
said the Times, Judge Breyer wrote this book. [Laughter.]

  Now, I plead guilty to that, but the purpose is a human purpose.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU know, there are problems that we are fac-
ing, and one of the problems we are facing in the judiciary is the
issue of backlogs and the creation of new judgeships. We have a
number of judges that we are trying to approve or go through the
confirmation process at trial and appellate level.
  In some circuits, there are proposals, on the ninth circuit particu-
larly, to increase the number of judges substantially. I think the
ninth circuit has 29 judges, and the idea is to increase the size to
38. Do you think that we need to try to relook at the organization
of circuits? I will ask you this, with an idea of having more of an
effective administrative approach toward it for decisionmaking.
Have we gotten so big in the judiciary, with so many judges, that
we need to relook at some alternatives that might be available?
  Judge BREYER. This is an area that you have thought about a
great deal, I think, from reading what the commissions have been
                                                370

that you have been on and your own experience. There are a lim-
ited number of alternatives, and eventually, I guess--you know the
door-closing approach doesn't work very well. The reorganizing
having more and more appellate judges has its problems. I some-
times describe that as judges can cause confusion, as well as en-
lightenment, and there are limitations on size and numbers at the
appellate level, certainly.

  The commissions have recommended, at least for future study,
the possibility of additional tiers in the Federal system. Without
advocating an approach, I think that eventually Congress and oth-
ers like you yourself who are interested in these problems will
begin to look at restructuring. That may happen. It may happen in
10 years, it may happen in 30, it may wait and see what happens
to the growth.

  The ultimate problem is delivering justice to people who have
problems. That is the basic bottom line. If it keeps growing and
growing, somehow, without depriving the public of justice, you have
to work out the effective way of doing it, and that could involve re-
structuring at some point.

  Senator HEFLIN. At the trial level, you know, we passed legisla-
tion in the Biden Civil Justice Reform Act authorizing various al-
ternate dispute resolution techniques. There are those, including
myself, who have some question about the constitutionality of the
mandatory aspects of ADR that might remove the right of trial by
jury. Do you have thoughts pertaining to alternate dispute resolu-
tion and whether its various forms can be effective? Do you have
any advice to leave us before you assume the black robe, and prob-
ably will not give us too much advice then from a legislative view-
point?

  Judge BREYER. I don't have better than you have, the ADR, et
cetera. There are human beings in the world. Those human beings
have problems. They get into disputes. Really, I think what they
are interested in, those people, are two things, to get the problem
resolved and to get it resolved fairly.

  Now, ADR, mediation, all those things have an enormous role to
play, because they can sometimes get people's problems resolved
faster, and then we have to watch, because there is a price that
could be paid in terms of fairness that you nor I nor anyone wants
to see paid. So I end up usually thinking, yes, it is a good idea to
look at all those things. They can produce wonderful results inex-
pensively. But watch, be careful that that system doesn't turn into
an unfair system.

  Those are the two general things in my mind that I think about
with that.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU reviewed a book in the New York Times en-
titled "Private Choices in Public Health." In that book, the authors,
Philipson and Posner, who are with the Chicago School of Economic
Concepts--and you have been accused of following that--used eco-
nomic theory to answer the public policy question of how much the
Government should spend on AIDS research. In reviewing the
book, you suggested that in matters relating to health and safety
policy, the Government should not use economic principles alone in
determining appropriate allocation of resources.
                                      371
  In that book, you indicated that Government allocates consider-
able resources to people who, by their own choosing, put them-
selves in danger, such as those who live on fault lines in earth-
quakes, and we come back and help. I think you used the illustra-
tion where we rescue mountain climbers, even though they know
the perils of where they are going into.
  What principles do you think, not just economic principles, that
one ought to follow in trying to follow the thing in a rational and
systematic fashion? What thoughts do you have on that? In that
book review, some questions are raised that are interesting, and,
of course, the issue of AIDS is something that is in the minds of
a lot of people today.
  Judge BREYER. The thrust of the review, it was a restrained
style. As I said, maybe my style is dry. I hope my thinking isn't
dry. My thinking was that, no, economics doesn't. So a person had
gotten into a bad fix and it was his or her own fault, to which the
response is so what, so what? If somebody comes to your doorstep
and they are in trouble, you help them. You help them, even if
maybe it is their fault. So what?
  In that kind of decision, I am not saying if you want to evaluate
a program or you want to know how well something is working or
you want to compare some alternatives, maybe economics has some
role there. But to the basic question of how do you help, that is not
an economic question. That is a moral question, and it is that kind
of thing that I think people should appeal to in that area, and that
is the kind of thing that they do appeal to, and you have to decide
those things as matters of legislative policy.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU have been asked about legislative history,
and this gives me some concern about the overall way that judges
interpret statutes, et cetera. I suppose that maybe my own think-
ing is that I may be halfway between Justice Scalia's concept and
yours.
  We had, for example, the Vietnam war that occurred. Some peo-
ple argue that that was unconstitutional, because Members of Con-
gress did not intend to authorize the President at the time to ex-
pand the war in the manner that he did. If, however, you read the
resolution, it was so broad that almost any exercise of Presidential
authority in Indochina would be in conformity with the language
of the resolution.
  Now, you could go back and find legislative history, pretty much,
that would have been that it was not intended to be as broad and
as comprehensive. Now, you have a situation where that occurs,
and then it may have been the authors' intent to give broad lan-
guage there. So it is a problem as to how far you go relative to the
language and how far you go in regards to legislative intent.
  I don't know, again, maybe a technocrat can decide some of these
issues, just like we have, of course, rules of statutory construction,
and it may well be that you have to have some type of rules that
need to be looked at.
  For example, report language, which is basically the report of the
chairman of the committee, but it may not be on the floor when the
discussion goes on, has been really the intent to go that far, or else
the Members of Congress did not read it and did not understand
it.
                                               372

  Another instance is where you have colloquys that are put into
the record and not read, but they are supposed to give legislative
intent. And sometimes, we use them as a way of reaching com-
promises, and it seems to me that it causes problems for judges.

  Report language--Justice Scalia makes a point that they never
voted on, and he says that you give attention to the report lan-
guage, and nobody ever votes on it, so you do not know whether
or not it really was the intent of the overall Congress, or was it
the intent of two or three individuals.

  It just seems to me that you are going to have more and more,
and you are going into a situation where you have got someone
who has strong opposite feelings, perhaps, from yours--but maybe
we will rely on your consensus-building ability to come up with
some rules relative to it. I think there is a need for some rules rel-
ative to how legislative history ought to affect the decisions that
are made relative to the interpretation of the intent of Congress.

  Do you have any comments on how far you think we might go?
Do you see problems with just outright saying, well, Congress
says--and here it is in the Congressional Record?

  Judge BREYER. It depends. I think no process works perfectly,
but I would like to think that in writing reports, there used to be--
and I think there is--it is a method. The different staffs of the Sen-
ators who are involved in that are supposed to, and when it is
working well, they understand their Senators' positions on matters
of policy, and they keep everyone informed.

  It used to be before any report came out, there were no secrets;
everything is circulated to everybody, and they are supposed to
read it and understand whether that correctly reflects the view, the
policy view, of the Senator who did the voting.

  And I do not know if it always works perfectly, but it is supposed
to be circulated, open, understood, and reflect the policy.

  Looking to reports--yes, sometimes. Sometimes floor statements
can help, and sometimes, for reasons that you say, they do not. I
find it more of an art, and it is hard.

  Senator HEFLIN. We are faced more and more in Congress with
the issue of federalizing crimes that have historically been in the
purview of the State legislatures for the crimes, and it may well
be that they feel that the issue is such; but there are dangers, of
course, of overburdening particularly, and judges are particularly
alarmed with the idea that they are transferring more and more
in the criminal field relative to it, and that that issue also has to
be looked at with the Speedy Trial Act, and that civil litigation
may suffer as a result of it because of the shortage of manpower,
the procedures that we follow, and increasing particularly in regard
to federalizing, putting more and more burdens on the Federal
courts.

  Do you have any thoughts as to what we ought to do relative to
this?

  Judge BREYER. My thinking is that people have a terrible prob-
lem with crime--it could hardly be worse; very, very bad--and they
would like help with it. And in respect to jurisdiction, that is one
aspect of the problem. That is not a determinative aspect.

  So my suggestion, if you are asking for a suggestion, is that
when Congress or a legislature of any State is working on criminal
                                               373 "·

jurisdiction, on criminalizing behavior, that they think out what is
going to happen in practice when this law is enforced--who will en-
force it; how; which courts will be affected--and then, with that in
mind, make a judgment about how to create a system, including
the way it gets into court, that will most effectively stop crime.

  In other words, I am asking, I think, to think, whether it is the
Justice Department, or here, or in other places, that they think
through ways of allocating crime-fighting resources as well as
courts, so that overall, you are more effective in the aim of fighting
crime.

  Senator HEFLIN. We have a number of problems dealing with the
issue of armed conflicts, and the Constitution relative to Congress'
power to declare war. And we have adopted the War Powers Act,
but there is a lot of feeling that we have gone to the extent where
executive decisions are made under the constitutional authority of
Commander in Chief, and that Congress, the representatives of the
people, have not really authorized the use of force in conflicts.
However, that is debatable when appropriation bills are approved.

  You, of course, have been here at various times. Do you have any
particular thoughts concerning the authority and what ought to be
done relative to this; or do you have feelings that the War Powers
Act is a proper approach to this issue?

  Judge BREYER. I do not have special thoughts that I would think
would be particularly enlightening in that area.

   Senator HEFLIN. NOW let me ask you about the Judicial Con-
ference. I am hearing more and more complaints that in the rule-
making power that the courts have--they send over their rules to
us, and we have a 6-month period in which to act to negate or to
change during that period of time. I hear more and more that there
is too much judge participation and not enough lawyer participa-
tion in the rulemaking process. And there are feelings that when
you get into judicial reform, that if you leave it to judges alone,
things will not change. I think C.K. Chesterton wrote a line one
time saying the horrible thing about all judges, legal officials, bar-
risters, and sheriffs was not that they were corrupt, or not that
they were incompetent, but that they had become used to it, and
therefore were not really looking to make much change that needed
to be made. And we are living in times where change is occurring
in so many different fields that we may well be looking in the fu-
ture toward some changes.

   But what has been your experience relative to--you mentioned
a while ago the American Bar Association and the relationship be-
tween judges and lawyers getting together to have a forum where
they can discuss issues. It seems to me that probably the Judicial
Conference and the advisory committees have moved away from
lawyer and public participants more than they should, and that
that input is needed.

  Judge BREYER. The input is important; the input is good. The
Conference itself works mostly through committees. The biggest
change that has been going on is the change resulting from the law
that you described earlier, Senator Biden's Civil Reform Act, and
that requires committees that are made up of lawyers and all kinds
of people who are not judges to have input into that process.
                                               374

  My impression has been that that input has been important and
has worked pretty well.

  Senator HEFLIN. I think that concludes my questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge on that score, there was a great deal of resistance at the
outset because of the very reason of including those folks, but I
must say I have been very pleased that most of the circuits have,
in an unsolicited way, come back and said, you know, this has
turned out to be a good thing for us.
  I think Judge Heflin has a point about the Conference itself.
  But I yield now--and again, just a little mechanical scheduling
here--I will yield to Senator Specter now, and what we will do
then is we will have a break, but
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, I am going to have about 5 min-
utes, or 10 minutes at the most, of questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, maybe, if it is OK, we can just finish with
Senator Simon, and then we will break. And then what we will do
is reconnoiter 10 minutes after that and find out how many other
Senators have questions. I do not think there are many more ques-
tions. Judge, and you are holding up well--your physical constitu-
tion is impressive--and then we will make a judgment as to how
late we will go. But we are going to finish with you tonight.
  So again, I say to the staff, please tell your principals to head
on back if they have questions.
  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Breyer, I not only compliment you on your stamina, but
your family on their stamina. Of all the participants, the Senators
have moved in and out--we have had votes and floor matters--and
not only have you been at the podium all the time, but your wife,
your three children, your brother, your sister-in-law. So it is a very
impressive family support.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you. I thank them, too.
  Senator SPECTER. When I finished my first round, I was asking
you questions about U.S. v. Ottati and Goss, which involved the
question of potential conflict of interest. And I said at the time that
I did not think there was an actual conflict of interest or anything
which undermined the question of your integrity.
  The question which I could not come to because of time limita-
tion was on the issue of Lloyd's potential liability on Superfund
cases; whether the principles that you set down in the Ottati case
might have affected many other factual situations where Lloyd's
could have had potential liability. And it has been called to my at-
tention that Justice O'Connor recused herself in two cases in which
NCR was a party in a tax challenge, and then participated in a
case involving Colgate-Palmolive Co. on an almost identical issue
which might have indirectly affected NCR's liability.
  The question which comes to my mind is whether there are not
ramifications which bear on public confidence, which should lead us
to take another look at the language of the disqualification statute,
which calls for disqualification, recusal, in a number of situations.
One is "any other interest that could be substantially affected by
the outcome of the proceedings." So that if a judge is to decide
Superfund liability, even though it does not involve Lloyd's, the
                                                 375

judge does not have an interest in any corporation, is not a party,
but those principles could affect a company in which the judge does
have an interest, that a broader look ought to be undertaken. And
you and I had a moment in our closed session to talk about such
potential liability, and you used the word "proximate cause," which
is a complex legal doctrine that befuddles many people as to how
far it goes on proximate cause. Lawyers will remember the Palsgraf
case, a traditional law school case, which illustrated how hard it
is to find out what is a proximate cause.

  And in the light of this issue, which is very much on your mind
and our minds, if you have a view that there might be a modifica-
tion of the recusal statute which would be broader--because when
people watch these proceedings, and disappointed litigants are
sometimes very, very disappointed--if we ought not go the extra
mile.

   Now, I realize we do not want to dissuade lawyers from under-
taking judgeships when they have investments, but my experience
has been that lawyers are very interested in being Federal judges,
very interested in being circuit judges, and even more interested in
being Supreme Court Justices.

   So might it not be worthwhile to broaden that recusal disquali-
fication statute so that there is absolutely no doubt anywhere? I
am not sure quite how we do it, but what do you think?

  Judge BREYER. I think the general word, better than "proxi-
mate"--I do not know if that was exactly it--what I am thinking
of with that is if the interest is--if there is only a speculative effect
on your investment, or a remote effect, or contingent, then, under
the present standard, you do not disqualify yourself. If it is a sub-
stantial effect, you do--direct, substantial--all right, those are the
words.

  And of course, as you point out, in that case, I did not think that
there could be more than an indirect or speculative or remote effect
on the insurance industry at all, let alone Lloyd's or my own pock-
etbook.

   Do you want to change that standard--that is really your ques-
tion. And I will sympathize with both things that you said. It is ab-
solutely crucial that the integrity of the system be clear, that peo-
ple have confidence in it, that they absolutely know that a pocket-
book is not guiding a case. That could not be more important to me,
not only personally--and it is personal--but to the system as a
whole.

   Now, if you are going to try to worry about--and it is worth wor-
rying about--but you will find judges do have investments. It is
perfectly clear that if any investment is directly involved in that
case, a party, you are out, even if it is worth one penny; but where
there is not that direct participation, the reason that the standard
have evolved as they have, I think, is because it is so possible there
will be remote or indirect connections in so many cases. Could a
judge sit in an FDIC case if he owns real estate somewhere, know-
ing that possibly the holding could in some remote way affect the
value of some real estate?

  What is the possible remote connection--do you see why I think
I agree with you that it is very difficult?

   Senator SPECTER. Oh, I understand. I understand your views.

      85-742 - 95 - 13
                                      376

  Judge BREYER. I am not saying that it is not worth thinking
about. I think it probably

  Senator SPECTER. We will struggle with it. It is a legislative mat-
ter. I have absolutely no doubt that you were not in that case with
any view to any money in your pocket.

  Judge BREYER. That is true. That is correct.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU would not be a Federal judge if you were
concerned about money, really.
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU might not even be a Senator if you were
really concerned about money. But the appearance, what litigants
think is something very different. And the principles from that case
are very far-reaching on Superfund liability and could involve lots
of money. We allocated $8.5 billion for Superfund. So that is some-
thing that we will struggle with, but I think that the experience
here today suggests that we would be wise to do that. It is a legis-
lative issue for the Congress.
  Shifting to another subject, Judge Breyer, there continues to be
intensive debate in this country on the establishment clause and
the appropriate separation of church and state. And I was pleased
to hear you forcefully affirm Jefferson's view of the wall of separa-
tion between church and state. That is not a universal view. Rev.
Marion Pat Robertson was quoted in the Washington Times on No-
vember 26, 1993, as saying the radical left keeps "talking about
separation of church and state. It is a lie of the left."
  The issue of the appropriate line comes up in a number of con-
texts. Now, there is absolutely no doubt that there is a valued place
in politics for people with deep moral and religious convictions, just
as there is a valued place in everyday life for people with moral
convictions. And there is no doubt that we need more morality in
our everyday life and not less of it. So there is no issue about ex-
cluding people from active participation in politics where people
have deep religious and moral convictions. But the question
emerges as to a mixture of church and state, where you have politi-
cal activities which are intimately connected with churches, and
there is the overlay of establishment--that is, help by the Govern-
ment--fairly directly in the tax-exempt status which churches
enjoy.
  And I would like to call your attention to two specific contexts
and then ask you a question. There are circumstances where politi-
cal rallies are held in churches, and a flier announces "(Blank) for
Congress. The (Blank) for Congress campaign is having our largest
rally in the (Blank) church on (Blank) day." And at the Texas Re-
publican Convention, there is a photograph of a placard for a spe-
cific candidate, on which it says a vote for that candidate is a vote
for God.
  The two questions which I would like to have your views on are,
first, what is your sense of what is happening to basic American
values involved in the mixture of this church and politics, and this
mixture of church and state; and how would you approach the un-
derlying constitutional issue--I am not asking you how you would
decide a case, but how you would approach the underlying constitu-
tional issue--on the implication of governmental financial sup-
                                               377

port--establishment, really--for churches through their tax-exempt
status?

  Judge BREYER. On the one hand, I know I had a case in which
I wrote that the school system, when they have a place open for
public meetings, has to let churches meet there, too, religious
groups, too. Certainly, there is support for religion in the Constitu-
tion.

  When you come to the establishment clause, it is well established
that that clause does not prohibit tax exemption. To the contrary,
there is tax exemption.

  Senator SPECTER. But the tax exemption is very narrowly tai-
lored and cannot cross the line where there is any support for a
political candidate--any support.

  Judge BREYER. And when you get into areas beyond that, when
you get into areas of definition when the support is greater, what
I have said before--and it is hard to go beyond this--is there are
difficult problems of line-drawing. The principle is fairly clear in
the establishment area at the extremes. Some is absolutely per-
mitted--the fire department, the tax exemptions of certain kinds,
busing of certain kinds. Some is quite clearly prohibited. And then
what you find are a difficult set of cases in this middle area, and
what is going too far.

  It is hard for me to be more specific than that, because those are
the cases that do come up, that are difficult, that I would have to
think about in light of the particular context. That is in the legal
area. Outside the legal area, I am not expert.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you have not given me too much on how
you would approach the legal issues, really, Judge Breyer; and you
have not given me anything on your sense of values aside from the
legal issues. We probe to get your thinking.

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. The one area which is not an impermissible
mixture of Senator and nominee is values. So how about it?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I think that is a fair question. And as I saw
what you described as the wall, what I saw as underlying that,
which I think is more important today than ever, is that we are
a nation--in terms of values--we are a nation of many, many dif-
ferent people, many different groups, many different religions, and
each person's religion--mine and yours, and that of every other
person--is extremely important to him, to her, to his family. And
the history of the first amendment teaches us that that importance,
legally, grows out of a world in which those religious differences on
matters of such importance led to wars, death--and you still see
that in some places.
  And for that reason, the thing that must be preserved is the free-
dom to practice, the freedom to pass that along to your children.
That is why schools are so important, and
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Breyer, those are--did you want to fin-
ish?
  Judge BREYER. NO, no.
  Senator SPECTER. Those are generalizations which I have heard
you say before, especially on the children, and I certainly agree
with you. And in our society, we are urging people to come into
Government and into politics with deep moral views and deep reli-
                                               378

gious convictions. But do you share my concern about having politi-
cal rallies in churches? It looks to me as if it is flatly against the
prohibition against political activity, support of a candidate when
a candidate is there, or where you have the mixture of "a vote for
my candidate is a vote for God."

  Does that give you a problem of our basic value on separation of
church and state?

  Judge BREYER. That is such a politically divisive and such a po-
litical matter, and so important to so many people in so many dif-
ferent directions, that I think I have to restrict myself in that very
divisive, potentially, very uncertain area. I have to draw back to
the law. And when I go back to the law and try to go further in
how I would approach the thing from a legal point of view, remem-
ber the thing that I have tried to identify as underlying this is each
person thinks, "My religion is terribly important," and each person
is right. Each person thinks, "I want to pass this on to my chil-
dren," and each person is right. But each person may think, or
many may think, "It is fine if the Government favors me and my
religion," but then, I would ask that person to think: But suppose
it is not your religion that the Government is favoring? And that
question, which asks for neutrality on the part of the people who
practice religion--me and you and everybody else--that is the kind
of question that the establishment clause is asking people to ask
themselves.

  Senator SPECTER. One final question on the subject before mov-
ing on. How would you approach the constitutional issue--I am not
asking you for a decision, but an approach--of the constitutional
issue that a religious group meeting in a church organizes itself as
a political party, perhaps takes over an existing party, and then re-
ceives taxpayer funds through Federal law which authorizes the
Treasury to defray the cost of a nominating convention for Presi-
dent?

  Judge BREYER. Oh, I see. You are thinking of the Government
program

  Senator SPECTER. Well, this is a specific Government program,
there is specific authorization for paying for Presidential cam-
paigns. And we do want people with deep religious and moral con-
victions involved in politics

  Judge BREYER. Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. But--but--how do you approach
the line?
  Judge BREYER. And can I go beyond the general thing that I
have tried to say about asking ourselves: "It is fine if it is my reli-
gion. How do I feel if it is somebody else's religion?" and is this
going to be impermissible favoritism, going too far, or is it the kind
of thing that we find all the time
  Senator SPECTER. And these are people who do not believe, do
not accept, the definition of church and state separation.
  Judge BREYER. The trouble is I keep coming back to thinking
that is one of those difficult line-drawing questions that could be
right in front of us if I am on the Court. That is my problem.
  Senator SPECTER. Senator Heflin broached the question of the
conflict between the President's authority as Commander in Chief
and the congressional authority to declare war, and this is a sub-
                                      379

ject which we have talked about with many nominees, and I know
that these confirmation hearings have some resemblance to profes-
sional football--we look at all your films, we read all your opinions
and all of your books; you look at the videotapes of our questioning
of a number of nominees. And I appreciated the meeting which you
and I had, and I told you that I was going to ask you the question
which I have asked before about the Korean conflict--was it a war?

  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, we are making some progress.
  Judge BREYER. Well, I do not know if that is too helpful, but yes.
Ask any of the people who were involved or their families, "Was
that a war?" and they will say it certainly was.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I was involved, stateside, however, but I
thought it was a war; maybe that is why I keep coming back to the
Korean war.
  We struggle in the Congress for a way to resolve it. Back in
1983, when Senator Baker was the majority leader, I drafted an ex-
tensive complaint, seeking original jurisdiction in the Supreme
Court, trying to get the agreement of the White House and the
Congress to make a submission under the War Powers Act. I do not
know that it would have worked, because there are ways that the
Court does not have to take those issues--nonjusticiable, not a case
in controversy, et cetera.
   Last year, we passed in an appropriation bill a prohibition of the
Department of Defense for using moneys in the military action in
Somalia beyond March 31, 1994. Now, we do not like to do that in
Congress, and earlier today, Senator Leahy and I were on the
floor--missing part of these proceedings--discussing the situation
in Haiti. There are some of us who are concerned that we may be
involved in a war in Haiti when the Congress is out of session, and
we passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we did not want to
see an invasion of Haiti; but a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does
not bind the President. Then, a resolution was offered that no
funds should be used for an invasion of Haiti, and that was de-
feated. And Senator Leahy and I came to sort of an agreement that
we really ought to face it head-on. No American war can succeed--
and we learned that in Vietnam--without public support, and the
way you start on that is to get congressional authorization. And I
hope that if the President wants to maintain the military option,
that he will come to the Congress and ask for a resolution of au-
thority, as President Bush did in Iraq, and let it be a congressional
declaration. If the President has to act in an emergency, so be it;
he can use his powers as Commander in Chief.
  And the question that I have for you, Judge Breyer: Is it realistic
to look for the third supreme branch? We know the courts are su-
preme to both the Congress and the President, because the Court
told us so in Marbury v. Madison. When the Constitution was
formed, the Congress was No. 1; the President was No. 2, in the
second article; and the courts did not come up until article III, but
all that was changed. It was renumbered in Marbury v. Madison.
  And the question is: Is it realistic to try to get some help from
the Court on breaking this conflict, which comes up very fre-
quently, between the President and the Congress, or do we have to
come back to the political give and take, and the withholding of
                                               380

funds, and the declarations on the Senate floor and the President
from his news conferences?

  Judge BREYER. It does--I looked up, I tried to find--after our
conversation, which was very interesting, I tried to see if there had
been any precedent where this kind of question was resolved in the
Supreme Court, and I think there has not been, though I think
that some of the Justices dissented and said that the Court should
get involved in that during the Vietnam period.

  I would say it does not surprise me, that absence of precedent,
because there is nothing more important than questions of war and
peace, and fighting and not fighting, and defending and not defend-
ing. And the kind of question you are talking about is of such ex-
traordinary importance to the public, and it is not surprising to me
that the courts, which are an unelected--unelected--third branch
of government, have said that these matters of such great impor-
tance in a political context should be worked out between the first
and second branches of government, both of which involve elections
and are responsible directly to the people. That does not surprise
me, that.

  Senator SPECTER. But these are constitutional issues.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. These are two basic, fundamental constitu-
tional provisions
  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. Which could really use some adju-
dication. We try all these right-angle automobile collisions in the
Federal courts; why not have the Federal courts get involved in de-
ciding this one? You cannot find a bigger one.
  Judge BREYER. I know, despite--I mean, I can understand what
has happened in light of what I just said, and it does seem to re-
flect something about the nature of these terribly important deci-
sions in a democracy.
  I thought--in addition, I know cases--we were talking to Senator
Pressler about the old, old case of the Indian tribes and so forth,
and sometimes, people can work out ways of getting these into
courts in certain contexts.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Breyer, moving to another subject--un-
less you want to say something further
  Judge BREYER. NO.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. I talked to you in our informal
section about Court-stripping, and it seems to me this is a fun-
damental issue. We talked about Marbury v. Madison, and I think
it is fair to say that you concluded the supremacy of the Court was
beyond challenge today
  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes, I think so.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. That Brown v. Board was beyond
challenge today.
  Judge BREYER. Correct, that is correct.
  Senator SPECTER. IS it your view that the Court cannot be di-
vested of jurisdiction to decide fundamental constitutional ques-
tions?
  Judge BREYER. I think the framework in that--basically, it is an
affirmative answer--the framework, the way that I see it legally
working out, there are two different circumstances. One, you start
                                      381
with article III, where it says the judicial power of the United
States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and other courts that
you in Congress create. And then it says the judicial power shall
extend to all cases of certain kinds, which it then enunciates.

  So that to me suggests--and this would be one kind of issue--
but if you take cases out of the courts and put them in a different
court, there will still be cases that you will not have the power to
take out of the Supreme Court because of the way that is written.

  The other kind of issue that comes up is where the courts are
deciding a case, but what Congress in principle might do is say let
us not make this a case. It used to be called a tort case. Now we
are going to give it to an administrative agency, and we will say
it is not a case anymore; it is an agency matter.

  Now, could Congress do that to any old thing and thereby remove
all those things from the Court? Justice Brandeis said the question
there is under what circumstances the process that is required by
the Constitution before you can invade life, liberty, or property is
due process; when is that due process judicial process? And obvi-
ously, he is thinking there would be a core of important cases
where the process that the Constitution requires before one takes
away liberty, and property in certain circumstances, that that is ju-
dicial process, and that is the area that the Constitution would pro-
tect.

  Senator SPECTER. I had questioned Chief Justice Rehnquist on
this issue, and he declined to answer, and finally did answer, that
the Congress could not take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court on first amendment issues. I then asked him about the
fourth amendment, and he declined to answer; declined on the
fifth, declined on the sixth. I then asked him why he would answer
on the first amendment but not on the fourth, fifth, and sixth. He
declined to answer that question, too.

  He went considerably farther, however, than Justice Scalia did,
who would not answer a question on Marbury v. Madison; and
Chief Justice Rehnquist went considerably further than Justice
Souter, who would not answer my question on whether the Korean
war was a war. And most of them went farther than Justice Gins-
burg did as a generalization.

  I was very surprised--and it has been my conclusion that nomi-
nees answer about as many questions as they think they have to.
I think you may be an exception, Judge Breyer. We may have the
"Breyer rule" coming out of these proceedings, that more questions
are being answered than a nominee would have to answer. I will
withhold judgment until the proceeding is over in its entirety, but
I think we may have the "Breyer rule" coming out of this proceed-
ing, which would be very good.

  I was very surprised in 1982 when the Senate passed an amend-
ment taking away the jurisdiction of the courts on busing as a rem-
edy, which is a constitutional issue. And I do not see how the Con-
gress can take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on con-
stitutional issues. Whether we like the remedy or do not, most peo-
ple long since have disliked busing. And let me ask you the ques-
tion: Does the Congress have the authority to take away the juris-
diction of the Supreme Court on a constitutional issue--equal pro-
                                               382

tection, the 14th amendment--to deprive the Court of the option of
remedy on busing?

  Judge BREYER. I do not think there is a categorical answer in
terms of constitutional versus nonconstitutional. The place to begin
in my mind is there is a famous opinion called Crowell v. Benson.
And really, in that opinion, Justice Brandeis wrote a concurrence,
I think, in which he tried to explain this view that sometimes the
process that is due is judicial process. And then, when is that proc-
ess judicial process; when does the right require judicial process?
And it is going to be something involving core liberty and terribly
important rights of fairness and so forth. And exactly which ones
and how would depend--if Congress ever passed such a statute,
and then it came up to the Court, you would get into looking at
the shadings and exactly how they did it. But that core principle
I think is well explained by Justice Brandeis in that case.

  Senator SPECTER. Would you agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist
that the Congress cannot take away the jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court on first amendment issues?

  Judge BREYER. Oh, you see, it is going to be the question--you
know there are issues and issues. The core principle there, the core
freedom of speech, it is pretty hard for me to see how that would
be possible, because if you want the kind of layman's reaction,
which is all I can do at this moment, it is to think my goodness,
what an important right, and isn't it judicial process--but indeed,
that kind of right, it maybe cannot be taken away with any proc-
ess.

  Senator SPECTER. I take that to be a "no."
  Judge BREYER. Yes, I think--what is the--I cannot remember at
the moment whether the question was phrased affirmatively or
negatively. [Laughter.]
  Senator SPECTER. The final question, Mr. Chairman.
  Can the Congress take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court on amendments IV, V, and VI?
  Judge BREYER. Again, it is the same core idea there. The core
idea, fundamental--some of those rights, they cannot take the right
away at all. And so, since you cannot take it away at all, you can-
not take it away with any process. And then, if you could limit it
at all, it is the kind of important thing that on its face would seem
to call for judicial process. The details would depend on a particu-
lar statute and what was really at stake.
  Senator SPECTER. I interpret that to be an answer under the
Breyer doctrine. Thank you.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think--I know, I should say--that Senator
Helms has many times introduced statutes to take away the juris-
diction of the Court. I do not think--I know the Congress never
successfully passed such an amendment. It could be it passed the
Senate; I do not know
  Senator SPECTER. We did pass it, Joe. We did pass it in 1982.

   The CHAIRMAN. I

  Senator KENNEDY. Was it the law?
  Senator SPECTER. NO; it did not go through conference. It did not
become the law. But I was really surprised
  The CHAIRMAN. But the Senate passed it.
                                               383

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. My recollection was it was a 58-
to-38 vote, and I could not believe my eyes and ears. I had not been
around here long. I still cannot believe my eyes and ears with some
frequency. But we in the Senate did pass an amendment which
took away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to use busing as
a remedy in a constitutional case under the equal protection clause.

  The CHAIRMAN. Again, Senator Simon says he only has part of
a round. I might say I think we are nearing the end. There is going
to be a vote relatively soon. Senator Simon will be able to ask his
questions, and we will take a break when the vote occurs.

  I would like those listening--as I understand it, Senator Brown
has some questions, less than a full round, and to the best of my
knowledge, after that, there is no one who wishes to take a full
round with the possible exception of Senator Pressler, and no one
wants to even take a part of a round that I am aware of, so we
could very well, with the grace of God and the good will of the
neighbors, be out of here by 7 o'clock--but then again, I have al-
ways been an optimist.

  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  First, a comment on what Senator Cohen and Senator Heflin
said in terms of legislative history. I think we dilute the strength
of legislative history, both for Justices and for the lower courts,
when we permit--and I have done it, along with all of us here--
when we permit speeches and other things to be entered in the
record as if given. The reality is the record ought to be the real
record, and I hope one of these days we change our rule so that
that is the case.
  Second, I think your exchange with Senator Metzenbaum was ex-
tremely significant. Your hope, obviously, is that you will be able
to sever the ties with Lloyd's of London soon. It may be--I hope
this will not be the case--it may be that it will last for years. That
means that your response to Senator Metzenbaum could be with
you for many years.
  I would request that you get a transcript and read it over, and
if you feel comfortable with it, fine. If you do not feel comfortable
with it, I think you ought to send a letter to Senator Biden, with
copies to the other members of the committee, so that we know
where we are on that, if that is agreeable.
  Judge BREYER. Yes, yes.
  Senator SIMON. And for the record, since they cannot
  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is agreeable, Senator. Thank you.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  There was a case that came to the Court from California, where
a California utility was supporting a certain stand, and a citizens'
group went to the utility commission and said, "We believe we
ought to have the right to have the other side presented, and we
would like to include that in the mailing of the utility."
  The utility commission ordered that to take place. The utility ap-
pealed to the Court, and in a divided opinion, the Court said you
do not--as part of freedom of speech for the utility, for the corpora-
tion--they do not have to send around a speech that they do not
agree with.
                                              384

  The question is: What rights in terms of the first amendment--
and I am not asking you to comment on that specific case--but
what rights under the first amendment does a corporation have;
and if it is a regulated corporation, does that differ from another
corporation?

  Judge BREYER. My understanding in the area of commercial
speech is that there is protection, but that it is different. And my
understanding is that it is not meant to impede legitimate regula-
tion. Quite clearly, the Federal Trade Commission can prevent peo-
ple in the commercial area from making statements that are false.
Quite clearly, various agencies can impose labeling requirements,
even down to exactly what words should be said, though that is,
of course, a form of regulating speech.

  I suspect that the case that you are discussing was a case that
arose on particular facts and particular circumstances looking to
see how necessary that particular regulation was in the particular
case compared with the right of the corporation. I am sure if that
kind of issue arose again, it would be important for me, if I were
on the Court, and any other judge to examine the facts and cir-
cumstances in light of the knowledge that commercial speech is dif-
ferent. There is protection, but there is also regulatory need which
feeds into the balance.

  Senator SIMON. TWO suggestions, finally. One is there has been
a lot of discussion about capital punishment. I would simply ask
you to read Justice Powell's reflections at some point. Justice Pow-
ell started off pretty much where you are starting off and decided
that his original opinion was wrong.

  Then, finally, another request of you. You said it was important
that you connect with reality, and I really think this is important.
I would like to read from a 1913 speech of Teddy Roosevelt. He
says,

  Our judges have been, on the whole, both able and upright public servants. But
their whole training and the aloofness of their position on the bench prevent their
having, as a rule, any real knowledge of or understanding sympathy with the lives
and needs of the ordinary hard-working toiler.

  I think there is wisdom in what Teddy Roosevelt had to say, and
I do not question for a moment your desire to continue to connect
with reality. But if I can use an example from my background as
a journalist, every once in a while when I am autographing a book
I have written or something like that, someone will say to me,
"Someday I am going to write a book." When they say to me,
"Someday I am going to write a book," I know it will probably
never happen. If they say, "within the next year or two years," then
it may happen.

  I would make this suggestion to you. Sometime between now and
the time you get sworn in, sit down with your wife and your family,
and spell out specifically for yourself--nothing you give to Paul
Simon or Joe Biden or anyone else. Spell out specifically for your-
self how you really will keep in touch with reality, the reality that
a great many Americans face, that, frankly, you are just not going
to see. As a Supreme Court Justice, I will encounter you occasion-
ally at a reception or, you know, at some event or another. But the
people who are there are not going to be unemployed; they are not
going to be living in a housing project; they are not going to be suf-
                                               385

fering. And I want a Supreme Court Justice to empathize with
those people who are struggling in our society.

  So if you would agree to do that, I would appreciate it.
  Judge BREYER. I will.
  Senator SIMON. And I have no further questions or comments,
Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Senator.
  With Senator Brown here, I know that it is a little bit longer.
Senator Brown says he does not have a full round. I think, because
there is going to be a vote shortly, if you can persist a while longer,
I would like to yield to Senator Brown now, and maybe we can fin-
ish up here.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Judge Breyer, my commendation. You have survived our trial by
inquiry quite well.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. I do not know if it is comparable to trial by com-
bat that the common law must have thought about, but you have
not only survived, you have prospered. I think Members from both
sides of the aisle have been most impressed not just with the qual-
ity of your answers but with the thought process that goes into it.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  Senator BROWN. I listened intently to the queries that were ad-
dressed to you about your book. I know you have written in a num-
ber of publications, but specifically "Breaking the Vicious Circle" I
assume was a series of lectures?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is right, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. Put out in a book form.
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  Senator BROWN. I read through that with what I hoped was a
searching eye to find out your position on issues, and I did not find
admonitions as to what our policy should be. What I found was an
urging that we understand the risk we are trying to address and
that we set priorities of what is most important to us since we have
limited resources.
  Is that a fair summary of what you tried to do?
  Judge BREYER. I think it is. That is what I was trying to do in
various ways, to make as clear as I can some of the problems of
maybe spending too much here and not enough there. And if people
think about that and then the public and people who read it or
anyone else in the world who is interested in this area decides that
is what we would like to do, that is the end of the matter. All it
does is it calls this to people's attention. They are to think about
it. And if we can think of a way that people would prefer, other
people, not me--I am the one calling it to their attention. If they
then think that is how they would like to proceed, fine. That is up
to other people, groups who know more about it than I do, calling
it to the attention of Congress, who then may decide to do some-
thing different or may not.
  Senator BROWN. Well, I noticed you analyzed the cost of a 95-per-
cent cleanup and analyzed the cost of the additional 5-percent
cleanup and compared it with the potential good that each did. But
                                               386

I did not find that you advocated not doing the last 5-percent clean-
up.

  Judge BREYER. NO, I did not. I said look at the problem. Look
at the problem, here are some suggestions as to how one might talk
to Congress. If you think it is a problem, I do not guarantee this
is the solution. I do not guarantee there is a solution. But I do see
this as a problem that is worth talking about.

  Senator BROWN. I want to draw your attention for a moment to
the fourth amendment, and I suspect you have these all memo-
rized, but let me just read the language.

  "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, pa-
pers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall
not be violated," and it goes on. Unreasonable searches and sei-
zures is the operable phrase.

  We had a proposal before Congress relating to requiring public
housing to be open to search, and presumably seizure if illegal
items are found therein. You have looked at fourth amendment
cases and ruled on one specifically where you dissented from others
on the panel.

  Does what is reasonable vary depending on the proprietary inter-
est in the residence? Specifically, is what is a reasonable search of
someone's home that they own different from what is a reasonable
search of a hotel room that you rent? Are either of those different
from a public housing unit that you rent? Does the standard of
what is a reasonable search and seizure vary with your ownership
interest?

  Judge BREYER. I think what happens under that is, of course,
there has to be a privacy interest of the person who is complaining
in any of the three. And then I think under this idea of
unreasonableness or reasonableness, the Supreme Court has cases
that, in general terms, describe circumstances in which something
is or is not reasonable. And my thought would be that those gen-
eral descriptions do not vary, but what might vary are the cir-
cumstances that bring something within or without.

  That is how I think it probably works.
  Senator BROWN. YOU focus on the circumstances, not necessarily
the particular proprietary interest.
  Judge BREYER. That could be part of the circumstance. I would
not say never.
  Senator BROWN. I wanted to draw your attention also to a con-
troversy that now rages over term limitations. The question is kind
of interesting. It relates
  The CHAIRMAN. The answer to this question could be very impor-
tant. [Laughter.]
  I just want you to know that. Look up here and determine how
many people have been here two or more terms and how many
have not. Let your conscience be your guide. [Laughter.]
  I want the record to show people are laughing. That is meant to
be a joke. It is late in the day. But go ahead.
  Senator BROWN. Let the record show that those over two terms
did not laugh as much as those under. [Laughter.]
  It is a fascinating question because it is based upon provisions
of the Constitution giving Congress the power to regulate itself in
                                               387

contrast to the provisions allowing States to set qualifications for
elections.

  Have you articulated publicly or privately a position on term lim-
itations?

  Judge BREYER. I do not think so.
  Senator BROWN. Have you come to a judgment in your own mind
as to whether it is a good policy or not?
  Judge BREYER. I would say, Senator, that I have been preparing
pretty hard for these hearings over the last few weeks. I have not
read the papers every day. I have not noticed every case that the
Supreme Court has decided to decide next term. But I did notice
one.
  Senator BROWN. Well, I do not ask you how you would rule on
that case. [Laughter.]
  What your preferences might be is significantly different than
how you would rule on a legal question. I do note that with your
home being in California originally, you may have an opinion on
the term limits referendum that was on the California ballot a few
years ago. I thought I would inquire if you have an opinion on the
wisdom of term limits.
  Judge BREYER. AS you can see, on this one, when other people
laughed, I have laughed. I have made no indication with my head
one way or the other. I do not think that I have particularly smiled
out of place. And I think that that is where I would like to leave
it, if that is all right.
  Senator BROWN. I have noticed that you would make an excellent
poker player, or that at least I should not play with you.
  For what it is worth, this issue is not overwhelmingly popular in
this body. However, we are often faced with difficult policy deci-
sions. Occasionally, someone will say, you must have decided never
to run for reelection to vote for that particular measure. Yet, the
difficult choice is often the right choice. Perhaps term limits could
help us make the right choice.
  My own conviction is that there are a lot of things that we ought
to be doing that we do not do. Reducing the deficit is a good exam-
ple. The term limits case is one that could well go either way; there
are excellent arguments on either side. I envy your opportunity to
review that case and I hope your deliberations will include a con-
sideration of how terribly important it is to this country that we
have people who serve in Congress who are willing to do things
that could never get them reelected.
  The last item I want to turn to is religious freedom. My under-
standing from what reading I have done in history is that the es-
tablishment clause, while it had a number of origins, really came
about because some colonies like Virginia had an established reli-
gion. The practice was to tax people and use some of that tax
money to support the Church of England, the Episcopal Church.
Some of the poor Scotchmen that came to this country later than
the English Anglicans were forced to pay taxes to support the
Church of England. That was why Thomas Jefferson was so fo-
cused on this issue. It is why he was so proud of his efforts to es-
tablish religious freedom. It is important to understand that the
framers viewed the establishment of a religion as an established
                                               388

religion that people of all faiths were forced by their tax money to
support.

  The words "establishment of religion" have taken on a much
broader meaning. I would be interested to know if you have a dif-
ferent view of the origin of the establishment clause.

  Judge BREYER. I do not have a better view. I do not have a better
view.

  Senator BROWN. It would be a tragic mistake to allow the Gov-
ernment to force people to support one religion or another. It would
be tragic to put people in embarrassing circumstances where, if
they had a different religious belief, they were humiliated. The con-
cern over public prayers reflects some of that.

  But I am appalled that we would prohibit under the establish-
ment clause a public prayer which someone can either listen to or
ignore. The way Americans have dealt with speech or public dis-
course in all other areas has been to ignore it or to listen to it, not
to stifle it. The idea of stopping people from making public utter-
ances in the name of the Constitution concerns me.

  If you have any comments you would like to make I would be in-
terested in them. But I do think there is a different side to the re-
striction of public prayer that has not really been brought into bal-
ance at this point, and that is the freedom of speech and the free-
dom of expression.

  Judge, thank you for what I consider to be an edifying experi-
ence. You are going to make a marvelous Supreme Court Justice,
and while I suspect all of us have areas we disagree with you on,
everyone that I have spoken with respects your intellect and your
honesty and believes that we will have someone with great integ-
rity on the bench.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate it.
Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, the Senator from Colorado and I will have
a chance to debate this, but like most things that you deal with as
a judge, there are factual questions that sometimes we think we
know the answer to and many times we do not. It has been my ex-
perience, being here 22 years, having observed at least 25 Senators
who have announced their retirement at least a year in advance,
I have not noticed a single one that I can recall where they have
changed their voting record.

  Senator BROWN. But many that should have. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Maybe should have. But I think it would be an
interesting study for us to do to see whether or not this presump-
tion that people do not vote courageously because they are running
again, in fact, stands up to scrutiny. It would seem to me the cor-
ollary would be true. If they have decided not to run, then they
would change the way in which they voted after they have decided
they were not going to run again.
  I am prepared to make a gentleman's bet that we would find that
that is as much an exception as the woman or man who chooses
to, while running again, make a courageous vote, knowing it may
cost them their election. But, at any rate, that is just a little aside,
because I know you have nothing else to think about, and I am
sure it is of no relevance.
                                      389

  I think we can conclude now, but let me just, from my perspec-
tive at least, put one cap on this whole issue of the Lloyd's of Lon-
don and the issue of whether or not there was any ethical breach.

  I would like to ask unanimous consent that the statute in ques-
tion be entered in the record at this point, the statute referred to
by Senator Specter, 28 U.S.C. 455.

  [The statute follows:]

                                        UNITED STATES CODE--TITLE 28

                                     JUDICIARY AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURE

§455. Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate
  (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself

in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
  (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:
        (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal
     knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;
        (2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in con-
     troversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such
     association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has
     been a material witness concerning it;
        (3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity
     participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding
     or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in con-
     troversy;
        (4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor
     child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter
     in controversy or is a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could
     be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;
        (5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to
     either of them, or the spouse of such a person:
             (i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a
          party;
             (ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;
             (iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially
          affected by the outcome of the proceeding;
             (iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the pro-
          ceeding.
  (c) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial inter-

ests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial
interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.

  (d) For the purposes of this section the following words or phrases shall have the
meaning indicated:

        (1) "proceeding" includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of
     litigation;

        (2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system;
        (3) "fiduciary" includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee,
     and guardian;
        (4) "financial interest" means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, how-
     ever small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in
     the affairs of a party, except that:

             (i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securi-
          ties is not a "financial interest" in such securities unless the judge partici-
          pates in the management of the fund;

             (ii) An office in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic or-
          ganization is not a "financial interest" in securities held by the organiza-
          tion;

             (iii) The proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance com-
          pany, of a depositor in a mutual savings association, or a similar propri-
          etary interest, is a "financial interest" in the organization only if the out-
          come of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the interest;

             (iv) Ownership of government securities is a "financial interest" in the is-
          suer only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the
          value of the securities.
                                      390

  (e) No justice, judge, or magistrate shall accept from the parties to the proceeding
a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b). Where the
ground for disqualification arises only under subsection (a), waiver may be accepted
provided it is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualifica-
tion.

  (f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge,
magistrate, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be dis-
qualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of
the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he
or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing
in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest
that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required
if the justice, judge, magistrate, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the
case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for
the disqualification.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me say, at least this one Senator's view of
how this plays out. It seems to me there are two distinct questions.
The first question is: Up until this point in your judicial career,
have you engaged in any activity at any time that is in any way
in conflict with the judicial canons of ethics and/or the statute that
I referenced that would lead any reasonable person or reasonable
persons to conclude that there was an ethical breach?

  For five out of the six scholars in this area we have spoken to,
some better known and respected than others, clearly from their
perspective, the answer is no, you have not violated any ethical
norm, written or spoken.

  Second, based on all the testimony here, and the cases I have
read that you have acted on, I think it is beyond any question that
you have acted ethically.

  The second issue is a tougher and less clear issue, and that is,
what do you do as a Supreme Court Justice from this moment on
or as a circuit court judge from this moment on in matters relating
to insurance cases which, somewhere through the ether, could even
affect a potential holding? And I think this is a case of first in-
stance in that, to the best of my knowledge, because of your invest-
ments and your wife's investments and your wife's country of ori-
gin, England, you are for a whole range of reasons the first person
before us invested as a Name in Lloyd's of London.

  You said in the late 1980's you wanted out but because of the
mechanisms that control Lloyd's of London and how that operation
works you were not able to do that. What do you do from this point
on? It seems to me that that comes down to a question of the ex-
tent of your potential liability as an investor, as a so-called Name
in Lloyd's of London. And we have had from various sources, re-
spected sources, estimates that range from as low as $37,000 to as
much as unlimited liability. And the probable area is something
closer to the potential maximum--that is in the $100,000 range.
But the truth is we are never going to be able to nail that down
with absolute certainty. The liability goes back to the 1980's. You
would think after 8, 9, 10 years you would begin to get a picture
of what that liability might be. If it was going to be as horrific as
some have suggested, we might be able to get a picture.

  I do not think anyone can say but the good Lord with absolute
certainty what that potential liability is. And I want to emphasize
to you what Senator Simon said. I for one am enthusiastic about
your nomination because I believe your judicial philosophy and
your character is beyond reproach, and your judicial philosophy is
                                      391
consistent with what--and this is what each individual Senator
has a right to consider--consistent with what I look to as to where
I would like to see this Nation move and how it should go. There-
fore, I do not want you recusing yourself from every important case
that comes forward.

  So I would look very closely at what you said today. And I am
not clairvoyant. I am not even as well schooled as you are in know-
ing what might or might not be the appropriate future course of
action. But it is something that is a case of first instance, to the
best of my knowledge and my staffs, and one that the Judicial
Conference and the Congress, unrelated to you, are going to have
to look at.

  So, because I know I will be asked, I want to state on the record
that I have looked at this as closely as I can, as dispassionately as
I am capable of doing, and have concluded the following: Have you
thus far in any way acted in an improper way? The answer is
clearly no. What is the font of wisdom as to how to act in the fu-
ture? I do not know. But I am prepared to bet on your integrity,
that you will find the appropriate way without cutting yourself off
from participation in the important matters of the next two dec-
ades that will come before the Court.

  I have one specific question for the record that has not been
asked, and unless my colleagues have questions, I would be pre-
pared to dismiss you. They may have comments, but I would be
prepared to dismiss you as a witness. That is, during the late
1980's or early 1990's, when you had concluded you wanted to get
out of the investment--that is, you wanted to divest from your
Lloyd's holding--you were told you thought that could be done by
the early 1990's, and then along came 1990 and it turned out they
said, no, because of potential liability, whatever the amount, that
will take longer. And now you are being told it would be around
1995 or 1996.

  Somewhere in that period, late 1980's, early 1990's, as I under-
stand it, you asked, well, can't I get out? Isn't there a way I can
get out of this? Can I get someone else to insure me by taking over
my potential liability, in effect?

  And that has been raised in the public press. I do not think any-
one has asked you that question. I think it is important for the
record that, A, you explain whether or not you did investigate that
avenue of exit, and, B, if you did, what conclusions you reached
and why.

  But, again, I want to make it clear this does not relate, in my
view, to whether or not anything that has transpired indicates in
any way that you have operated in any way as a judge other than
with the highest ethical standards. But would you answer that
question for me or discuss that broad issue of did you try to get
out, is there a way you could have gotten out? If you did, why
didn't you and so on? Then, hopefully, that will be the end of this
issue before this committee.

  Judge BREYER. At that time I thought
  The CHAIRMAN. "That time" meaning?
  Judge BREYER. Meaning roughly in, I guess, 1990 approximately,
1991, roughly in there. From all I knew my maximum liability if
I stayed was around, I guess, something like 25,000 pounds, and
                                      392

I had a lot of insurance with companies outside Lloyd's that would
protect me from a further loss.

  When I made the inquiry, I was told it is not practical, and then
when I--I mean, my impression was it was not practical to get out
immediately. And I was enforced or reinforced in that view by the
response, which was: If you want to leave immediately, you will
have to pay a figure which is almost 10 times, 8 to 10 times that
amount. My impression was if I waited for maybe a year or two--
and now it is into 1995--Lloyd's would arrange through the rein-
surance company that I would be released and the amount would
relate roughly to what I am likely to be liable for. So I took that,
as a practical matter, as a negative indication.

  The CHAIRMAN. I said that was the last question. It is the last
question from me on this issue, but, again, for the record, on a mat-
ter that has been in the press, I think it is important for you to
state on the record an issue about which I know of no concern by
any member of this committee, but I think it is important the pub-
lic know and know the distinction. That is the so-called Social Se-
curity tax issue.

  You have indicated to the committee that you did not pay Social
Security taxes in the first instance for a cleaning person who
worked with you beginning in the early 1980's, if I am not mis-
taken; that you did not pay any tax before 1993, although all such
taxes that were due have been paid and paid in full.

  For the record, would you please explain how you handled this
matter and why you initially concluded that you did not have to
pay Social Security taxes for this person?

  Judge BREYER. At the beginning, at the very beginning, I think
January or February 1993,1 read in the paper that a man who was
being considered for a Justice Department post owed Social Secu-
rity taxes on a part-time home worker who was over the age of
65--indeed, who was in her seventies. At that point, I suddenly
thought, well, we have a person who is close to 80, and she is part-
time, and why don't we owe taxes on her?

  My wife and I and the person discussed this, and we all had
thought, incorrectly--incorrectly--that if a person is receiving So-
cial Security, as she always had been, you do not have to pay Social
Security. At that point, since we realized there was a problem, Jo-
anna went to the IRS. We straightened out the problem. We ini-
tially paid immediate

  The CHAIRMAN. This person is an American citizen?
  Judge BREYER. Yes; yes, an American citizen with a passport.
American passport.
  The CHAIRMAN. And she was an American citizen at the moment
she worked for you?
  Judge BREYER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. An important point to make.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; and what we did was then go to the Internal
Revenue Service, Joanna did. We immediately paid the tax for
1992. We had to send away for lots of forms, because it goes quar-
ter by quarter, to get all the taxes and forms and everything back
until she really first came on that basis. I think it was some time
just after 1980, approximately. And we then got all the forms. It
took a period of weeks, and we sent the money in for each quarter.
                                      393
  Then, after June of last year, during the summer, there were a
number of open questions. It was difficult or uncertain what we--
Joanne went back to the IRS. They were very helpful, worked
through this, decided that it was a borderline case, gave us forms
to fill out, gave us forms for her to fill out; and on the basis of long
questionnaires and so forth, ultimately determined that we did not
owe taxes because she was not an employee.
  The CHAIRMAN. The IRS made that determination?
  Judge BREYER. Yes, that is right. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU were not petitioning for them to reach that
conclusion?
  Judge BREYER. NO; you fill out a form. They have a system that
they will work it out for you, for anyone. Anyone who wants to
come in and fill out that form and go through this process, they
will make a determination for you.
  The CHAIRMAN. And the issue is if one is an independent contrac-
tor
  Judge BREYER. YOU do not owe it.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are not required to pay Social Security
taxes.
  Judge BREYER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. If one is not an independent contractor, you are
required to pay Social Security taxes; correct?
  Judge BREYER. That is right. And they determined that she was
an independent contractor, and we did not owe the Social Security
up through the end of 1988. But, thereafter, 1989, 1990, 1991, we
did owe it and the result of that--and we had paid in 1992 and we
paid in 1993.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did they tell you why you did not owe up until
1980, why her status changed from independent contractor to an
employee?
  Judge BREYER. My belief is that there are a bunch of factors on
which they make that determination, and the thing that had
changed, though I was not aware of this, is that at that time,
though she came in the same way she always had to us, she had
stopped working for other people. I think she was, you know, in her
late seventies. That, I think, was then the determinative factor.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is my understanding, that because she no
longer worked, beginning in 1989 or whatever, for anyone but you,
she lost her independent contractor status. You gained the respon-
sibility of being responsible for paying Social Security even though
she was on Social Security the entire time.
  Judge BREYER. Yes; that is the situation as far as I knew it, and
that is my understanding of what happened.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, were there any penalties you had to pay for
those 4 years or whatever?
  Judge BREYER. Initially the IRS assesses a penalty automati-
cally. What happened thereafter, since they determined it was a
borderline case and they understood that we were in good faith, is
the IRS refunded to us all the payments we had made up until--
through the end of 1988, and also all amounts that they had auto-
matically assessed a penalty. So they canceled that and we received
the money back.
                                      394
  The CHAIRMAN. SO the totality of what you paid was roughly 4
years of the period that they, the IRS, concluded she was not an
independent contractor.
  Judge BREYER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you had an American citizen who was receiv-
ing Social Security from almost the beginning of her first time she
walked into your house, who worked for you part-time along with
other people as well. At the end of the 1980's, she stopped her part-
time status with others and only continued part-time with you.
Your responsibility from the point of view of the IRS legally was
triggered at that moment. And they believed you acted in good
faith; therefore, there was not a penalty assessed other than the
back payment of the Social Security taxes for the point beyond
which they concluded this American citizen on Social Security was
working only for you and was no longer an independent contractor.
  Judge BREYER. That is my understanding.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is the understanding of the investigative
staff, minority and majority as well, but it is an important point,
I think, to make sure we have on the record.
  I have no further questions. To the best of my knowledge, no one
else has any further questions. I would yield--I am sorry. Do you
have a question?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Just joking, Mr. Chairman. I am sure
soon-to-be Justice Breyer would be delighted at my not having any
questions. If I have any, I will submit them to him later in writing.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would ask the ranking member or your chief
sponsor, if you will, if they have any closing comment to make.
Otherwise, although it will not be as pleasurable being able to look
out tomorrow and see your lovely family, when they finish, you are
finished, and your family is finished, in terms of being required to
be here before the committee.
  Senator HATCH. And I do not want any enthusiastic demonstra-
tions here in this room.
  Judge Breyer, we have thoroughly examined to the extent of our
ability to do so these problems. You certainly, in the case of
Lloyd's, have made an investment that has been unfortunate--like
a lot of people. But from what I can see, if every judge would con-
duct himself or herself with the concerns about conflicts of interest
or other difficulties as you have conducted yourself as a judge, and
as you have indicated you will conduct yourself hereafter as a
member of the Supreme Court, I think we would all be very, very
happy in this country; and I believe most judges do, most if not all.
  So you have more than satisfied, I think, all of us that you are
sensitive to the recusal problems and that you will recuse yourself
in cases where you have the slightest concern that there might be
any legitimate concern on the part of others that you should not
sit on the case.
  I do not know what more we could ask of a judicial nominee or
a sitting judge than that. And you also have expressed the opinion
that recusal is an important issue both ways. It is important for
you to recuse yourself if the recusal is necessary; but it is also im-
portant for you not to recuse yourself and avoid a tough case when
it is not unnecessary, and you understand the distinction. And I
think you have articulated it well, and I hope that you have put
                                      395
to rest some of the criticisms that some have offered, some of which
I felt are way beyond where any judge should have to meet.

  But the important thing is that I am certainly satisfied that you
are not only a very honorable person and a very ethical person, but
one who will maintain those high standards of honor and ethics as
you serve on the Supreme Court.

  I think your testimony has been effective in that regard, but
knowing you as well as all of us do, and having watched your ca-
reer, we have the very highest expectations of your success as a Su-
preme Court Justice and your handling of these particular issues.
And I think the public can have confidence as well, not only from
your remarks here, but from your demeanor and the way you have
handled yourself in the past.

  So I just want to make that very, very clear, that I think there
is little or no room for speculation here, and I hope the American
people understand that. And I personally appreciated your testi-
mony on so many issues. I have not agreed with you on everything,
but my goodness, nobody is going to agree with every other person
on everything.

  So what is important here is that you have demonstrated a tre-
mendous legal acumen; I think a tolerance that sometimes is dif-
ficult under the circumstances; good judicial temperament. You cer-
tainly have the capacity and the ability not only to be the chief
judge of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but to be an Associate
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I want to congratulate you
for a really good set of hearings.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Kennedy will close.
  Senator KENNEDY. Just very briefly, Mr. Chairman, I want to ex-
press our appreciation to Senator Biden and Senator Hatch for the
way that the hearings have been conducted and for all of the cour-
tesies that were extended. I know I can speak for Judge Breyer,
but I think for all of us.
  I think all of us realize that there are a lot of important votes
that are cast by Members of the U.S. Senate, but very few are as
important as the one that is cast in this instance in terms of serv-
ice on the Supreme Court. It is really one of the most important
responsibilities of the President and certainly of Members of the
Senate and us here on the Judiciary Committee as instruments of
the Senate in attempting to present to the Senate the qualifications
of the nominee.
  And I want to say again, as someone who has known Judge
Breyer for a long period of time, that hopefully, the members of
this body, through the media, have gained a recognition of some-
thing that all of us who have known him and have worked with
him have about this very unique and special individual. This expe-
rience, I think, of these hearings, as Senator Brown and others
have mentioned, will remain with us. Judge Breyer has been in-
sightful and illuminating in terms of his responses to these ques-
tions. All of us who know of his service in the first circuit and have
known of his service on the Watergate Commission and in the Jus-
tice Department, and his service to this committee, have known
what everyone on those courts, and his friends and colleagues have
                                      396
known, as a man of the most extraordinary integrity and personal
judgment and ethical behavior.

  We have been appreciative of the opportunity to hear the re-
sponses and also to question you about some of the items that have
been raised. I must say we really appreciate your presence here,
and we are looking forward to having the conclusion of these hear-
ings in the way that has been outlined by the chairman, but I want
to express this Senator's appreciation for the way that you have re-
sponded to these questions, and the frankness, the candor, and the
honesty. Many of them have been difficult and trying, but this is
a process, and I want to say that all of us who have been proud
to have supported you at the earliest part of these hearings are
prouder now. I think President Clinton deserves great credit for
this nomination, and I am confident that Judge Breyer will truly
be one of the outstanding Justices not only on this Court, but on
any Supreme Court.

  I thank the chairman.
  Judge BREYER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  A little housekeeping here. We will adjourn within moments. To-
morrow, we will come back into session at 10 o'clock. We are anx-
ious to hear the public witnesses. Some will come to criticize; most
will come to praise. But we are prepared and anxious to listen to
both the praise and the criticism.
  There are two types of testimony we will receive tomorrow. There
will be public testimony, where the witness actually comes and tes-
tifies, and there will be written testimony, which is the tradition
of this committee.
  We have invited all of the individuals who have commented pub-
licly, that we know of, on the issue of Lloyd's of London to submit
written testimony, so everyone will have that--it will be available
for the press and for the record and for all Senators--as well as
the spoken testimony, we will have tomorrow.
  I hope--it is my expectation--that we will be able to close the
hearing tomorrow, but if any witness has anything of consequence
they wish to discuss, we will conduct it exactly as we have here.
If there is a need to go beyond that, there is no problem. I do not
anticipate that.
  I want to thank you, Judge. It has been a pleasure having you
before us, and I do thank you. Some of the folks at the White
House maybe did not even communicate it to you--they probably
did not need to--they thought I was at the beginning, before this
process began, somewhat stern by indicating that as much as I
liked you, that if you did not respond to the questions, I would not
vote for you. I am delighted I did not have to be put in that spot,
because I think it is important--I think it is important for the
American people to be able to have a glimpse into your think-
ing
  Judge BREYER. I agree.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. How you think about these issues,
even though it does impact upon how you might possibly vote. I do
not think it in any way jeopardizes your independence or the inde-
pendence of the Court. From the moment we confirm you, assum-
ing that is what happens, you will not have to speak to anyone
                                      397
again if you do not want. You are there for life. This is our one
chance, and the American people are entitled, entitled, to know. No
one who is nominated for the Court is entitled to be on the Court
any more than anyone who announces for public office is entitled
to hold public office. But it is a privilege, a privilege which I think
you deserve, although I will, as you would say in your studied man-
ner, I will truly keep an open mind tomorrow to those who will
criticize and listen to their point of view. But there is nothing that
I have heard thus far that would lead me to conclude anything
other than what Senators Hatch and Kennedy have said, and Sen-
ator Brown, and everyone who has spoken, that I think you will
make a fine Justice, and I appreciate your family and the courtesy
that they have shown to us by being so patient.

  I hoped, as I indicated to one of your daughters at the beginning,
that this would be a painless operation. She probably thought I
was talking about physically painless as well; I did not mean that.
I meant emotionally painless.

  And Judge, I want to thank you and publicly thank the President
for sending two nominees in a row over which we did not have to
worry about hiring Capitol Police to keep the interest groups from
being at one another's throats in the back of the room. You have
no idea how much I, as chairman of this committee, personally ap-
preciate the fact that we do not have one of those hearings. It is
the only part of my job I hate. You have made me like my job
again. I thank you very much, and I publicly thank the President.

  Having said that, we will now adjourn until we begin to hear the
public witnesses at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.

  Judge BREYER. Thank you.
  [Whereupon, at 6:54 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re-
convene at 10 a.m. on Friday, July 15, 1994.]
NOMINATION OF STEPHEN G. BREYER TO BE
  AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                               FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1994

                                                               U.S. SENATE,
                                            COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in room
SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
(chairman of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Heflin,
Simon, Feinstein, Hatch, Grassley, Specter, Brown, and Cohen.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Today we begin our panels of public witnesses, whose input into
the Supreme Court and all of our judicial nominating process this
committee takes very seriously. We have afforded over the decades
and requested--"afforded" may be the wrong word--the American
Bar Association to testify before this committee and give this com-
mittee its judgment as to qualifications of judicial nominees. It is
something we take seriously, and it is something that the ABA
takes seriously. And I know they take it seriously because Irene
Emsellem represents them, and she used to be on this committee.
So I know it has to be serious if she is still willing to represent
them.
  All kidding aside, I do welcome our first panel. It has been the
tradition of this committee long before my chairing the committee
that the first public witness before the committee would be the
American Bar Association. And our first panel today, testifying on
behalf of the American Bar Association, includes Mr. Robert Wat-
kins, who chairs the Bar Association's Standing Committee on the
Federal Judiciary. A former U.S. attorney, Mr. Watkins is a part-
ner in the firm of Williams and Connolly here in Washington, DC.
  Accompanying Mr. Watkins is Mr. Michael Greco, who is a part-
ner at Hill and Barlow in Boston, MA. Former president of the
Massachusetts Bar Association, Mr. Greco is the first circuit rep-
resentative to the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judi-
ciary.
  Gentlemen, we welcome you and thank you for your effort and
work. I might point out for the record that, although this commit-
tee and individual members of the committee have occasionally had
disagreements with the ABA and their recommendations, it under-
takes a great deal of work for which there is no compensation. We
appreciate your public service in that regard, and we are going to

                                              (399)
                                               400

ask you, as well as all the public witnesses, to attempt to limit
your comments to 5 minutes, if you would.

  Mr. Watkins, welcome.
PANEL CONSISTING OF ROBERT P. WATKINS, CHAIR, AMER-

  ICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE
  FEDERAL JUDICIARY, WASHINGTON, DC; AND MICHAEL S.
  GRECO, FIRST CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, AMERICAN BAR
  ASSOCIATION, STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JU-
  DICIARY, WASHINGTON, DC
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Members of the committee, my name is Robert Watkins. As you
heard, I practice law in the District of Columbia, and I am chair-
man of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the
Federal Judiciary. With me today is Michael S. Greco of Boston,
MA, the committee's first circuit representative and the principal
investigator in this investigation.
  We appear here today to present views of the American Bar As-
sociation on the nomination of Stephen G. Breyer, Chief Judge of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, to be an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
  At the request of the administration, our committee investigated
Judge Breyer's professional qualifications. Our investigation as-
sessed Judge Breyer's integrity, his judicial temperament, and pro-
fessional competence. Our work involved discussion with more than
500 persons, including Supreme Court Justices, Federal and State
court judges from all over the country, and practicing lawyers
throughout the United States. The committee members also inter-
viewed law school professors, including constitutional law and Su-
preme Court scholars.
  In addition, Judge Breyer's opinions were read by two reading
groups. One group consisted of Supreme Court practitioners. It was
chaired by Rex E. Lee, former Solicitor General of the United
States and currently the president of Brigham Young University.
The other group was made up of law professors on the faculty at
Vanderbilt University School of Law. This group was chaired by
Prof. Nicholas S. Zeppos of the Vanderbilt Law School. Their re-
ports were evaluated by members of our committee who also read
Judge Breyer's opinions and his published writings on various legal
subjects. Finally, Judge Breyer was interviewed by two members of
our committee.
  The committee began its investigation of Chief Judge Breyer on
May 17, 1994, and completed its work on June 30, 1994. Based on
our evaluation, we reported to the White House and to this com-
mittee that the standing committee is unanimously of the opinion
that Judge Breyer is well qualified, the highest rating for a nomi-
nee to the Supreme Court of the United States.
  That rating is reserved for those who are at the top of the legal
profession, have outstanding legal ability and wide experience, and
meet the highest standards of integrity, professional competence,
and judicial temperament. The well-qualified rating merits our
committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.
  I have filed with the Judiciary Committee a letter describing the
results of our investigation and shall not repeat those results in de-
                                      401
tail here. I request that the letter be included in the record of these
proceedings.

  To summarize our findings, the committee is satisfied that Judge
Breyer's academic training, his broad experience in the Federal
Government, his service on the faculty of a distinguished law
school, his scholarly writings, and his distinguished service for 14
years, 4 as chief judge, on the court of appeals establish his profes-
sional competence. His integrity is above reproach, and he pos-
sesses and exhibits the highest level of judicial temperament.

  We are pleased to have the opportunity to appear here today to
present the committee's findings, and we will respond to questions
about our investigation and evaluation of Chief Judge Breyer.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Watkins, I really only have one question, and it is a question
often raised to me as the chairman of this committee by my Repub-
lican and Democratic colleagues. That is the elements you look at
in considering your evaluation, while evaluating and considering
your recommendation.
  With regard to lower court judges, district court judges, and cir-
cuit court judges--obviously both very important, but particularly
district court judges--we often find ourselves in the circumstance
in this committee, particularly when we are attempting to find--
not we, but when the President, this President or former Presi-
dents recommend minorities, or recommend people who have had
distinguished legal careers but have had legal careers that either
have been confined to academia or confined to commercial practices
where they did not do any trial work. You often withhold--not you
personally, the ABA often withholds recommendations, and occa-
sionally withholds the most positive recommendation and occasion-
ally recommends "unqualified" based upon the fact that the par-
ticular nominee did not have trial experience or has not practiced
the law in the sense that they have been in a law firm and han-
dling the cases of individual clients and conflicts and controversies.
  That has created some difficulty, depending on the President and
the nominee, difficulty with Republican Senators or Democratic
Senators as to whether or not the ABA is doing the job as it should
be done from their perspective.
  My question is this: Judge Breyer, who has incredible creden-
tials, to the best of my knowledge, if he were coming here for the
district court judgeship in the State of Massachusetts, someone
would say, well, he has no trial experience. He has not practiced
law. He has been a brilliant professor, a significant legal scholar,
handled the job that your former associate, Cynthia Hogan, who
runs my staff on this committee and who will not go back to your
firm, if I have anything to do with it. You cannot have her back
at Williams & Connolly.
  All kidding aside, he has done that job, but he has not, to the
best of my knowledge, gone out there and practiced law like both
of you do. Explain to the committee, will you, if that is a consider-
ation in the Supreme Court, and if it is a consideration for district
courts, and why in one and not the other?
  Mr. WATKINS. Senator, you are correct in your portraying the ap-
proach that the ABA takes to evaluating judges, nominees to the
various courts. And I think that we cannot use gross terms, and
                                               402

we have to separate those in the district court from those from the
court of appeals and those from the Supreme Court.

  In the courts of appeals and in the Supreme Court, it is vitally
important for us to have people who have the academic, analytical
ability to take complex controversies and resolve them through
analysis and writing.

  Oftentimes, people that have those characteristics do not come
from the trial bar. They come from the ranks of academia. And if
you will recall, since I have been chairman of the committee, I be-
lieve that there have been at least three law school deans or profes-
sors who have been approved, not for the district court but for the
courts of appeal.

  The CHAIRMAN. Correct.
  Mr. WATKINS. The district courts provide a somewhat different
situation. Our committee believes that some of the most important
issues of our time are first presented in the U.S. district courts of
the United States. And we also believe that lawyers who are going
to be district court judges ought to have been involved in the trial
process, not necessarily in the Federal courts but in some courts
where they understand the trial process, not only understand it
from a reading-books point of view, but actually have been involved
in the trial process, have tried cases, have taken depositions, have
argued motions. And on those candidates, our committee uses as
one of the criteria--not the only criteria--one of the criteria the
ability and the experience of having tried cases.
  Now, let me turn to Judge Breyer. Judge Breyer, I believe it is
true that he has not tried any cases. However, he has been a dis-
tinguished professor at the Harvard Law School. He has been a
Chief Judge for the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for 4
years, and 10 years before that, he was a judge on the court of ap-
peals.
  He in that capacity has taken those difficult controversies that
come from the district court and analyzed them, resolved them,
written about them, and some of those controversies are similar
and, indeed, may be identical to the kinds of issues that he will be
called on to resolve in the Supreme Court of the United States.
  So I think a short answer to you would be that the district courts
pose a slightly different problem than the courts of appeals and the
U.S. Supreme Court. And since Judge Breyer is a nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court, our emphasis on trial experience is somewhat
less than it would be if he were being considered for the U.S. dis-
trict court in Boston.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I appreciate the answer. My question was
not meant as a criticism. It was meant to lay in the record what
I just told you so you understand this committee, because occasion-
ally--I do not think there has been much conflict between the
Chair and the committee, but occasionally there has been conflict
between the committee and the ABA. And I just would want the
record to show that there is that distinction, and the rationale for
the distinction is as you have stated it.
  As you well know, under the law, under precedent, we are not
bound in any way to accept your recommendations. I can say up
to this point my support for Judge Breyer is enthusiastic--I have
not heard all the witnesses today, so I will withhold final judgment
                                               403

until I hear everyone. And I think he is a fine man who will poten-
tially make a great Justice. I for one think we should have people
like you on the bench. I mean "you" in the editorial sense. I do not
know you well enough to know whether you should be on the
bench, but I think there should be people like you gentlemen. This
is the first Court that I am aware of in over 200 years that has
no practitioners of any consequence on it, and that is a serious
problem, in my view. That is a serious problem.

  I want Justice Powells on that bench. I want Hugo Blacks on
that bench. I want Earl Warrens on that bench. If I want that, the
only way to get that is have Orrin Hatch appoint me President.
But, I do not get to choose that.

  Senator HATCH. I am thinking about it. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. But, seriously, I think it is a very important
point because we are going to have some conflicts as we go on, we,
this committee and the bar. We are probably going to reject the
recommendation of the bar with regard to an unqualified rec-
ommendation for a district court judge in Maryland because the
person had not had trial experience. We happen to think, looking
at all the other factors you consider, my guess is we will say that
person should be confirmed.
  So I do not want people to misunderstand that the differences re-
late to any fundamental character questions. They relate to what
you weigh as the most important factors and having the best guess
that we will have a good judge, and to what we relate to it. In this
case, I do not think there is much of a disagreement at all, and I
am not suggesting Judge Breyer has to have trial experience, be-
cause I, quite frankly, think his experience in working in public
matters, working in the political fora, gives him the same kinds of
exposure one would get in court.
  This is not a case against academics. I do not mean that at all.
But I would like to see a Court made up of people who have actu-
ally, to use the trite phrase, been in the trenches, had to stand be-
fore clients and say, well, I do not know whether we are going to
win this one, we have a settlement offer, I cannot guarantee you,
we could get more, or not get more, I cannot guarantee you would
be found guilty or innocent, but here is my best judgment.
  They are hard decisions for lawyers to make, hard decisions, and
I would like to have a few people on the Supreme Court who have
had to make those kinds of hard decisions in addition to the very
difficult decisions academics and scholars make as well.
  So that is the reason I have raised the question, because we have
not had much of a chance to talk about the entirety of the process,
and I will refrain from doing that any more now. But I wanted the
record to reflect the basis upon which you legitimately look to trial
experience for the district court, and ironically, weigh that more.
In the minds of the average person, they would say, well, gee, why
would a person for the lowest court have to have that experience.
Well, there is a good reason why, and you have stated it.
  Mr. Greco, you look like you want to say something.
  Mr. GRECO. Senator, just for the record, in the case of Chief
Judge Breyer, I found during my interviews of the outstanding
members of the trial bar in the first circuit that Judge Breyer en-
joys tremendous respect on the part of the trial bar.
                                                404

  The CHAIRMAN. Absolutely.
  Mr. GRECO. And I think this is so because, in addition to what
you were saying, which is true--it is important to have a balanced
court, especially at the Supreme Court level--what is equally or
more important is to have an individual who has the respect of the
trial bar and who is respected, among other things, for his fairness
and open-mindedness and his concern for resolving disputes involv-
ing ordinary people. And Judge Breyer has that respect, and I just
wanted to point that out for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. He clearly does, and Judge Breyer has one of
those unique abilities to seem to be able to master the subject mat-
ter before him that impacts upon the people who are before him.
He not only has the sympathy of the trial bar; I have no doubt that
he understands the trial practice as well as anyone could who has
not had a trial practice.
  So I do not have any doubt about that ability. I just thought it
was important that it be in the record, because people, my col-
leagues--this is basically a "get out of jail free" card for me a little
bit, Mr. Watkins--because my colleagues constantly say to me, Joe,
why do you listen to the ABA when they review this guy that the
President sent up or this woman the President sent up in my dis-
trict, who has practiced law for 21 years and is a fine person and
give him or her a partially unqualified, you know, a mixed rating.
And I say, well, why did they get the rating? They say, well, look
at it. The rating says because they have not had a trial practice.
So this discussion here is in part to explain that process as well.
  J thank you for your answer. And, again, I do not have any doubt
about Judge Breyer's ability to handle anything that comes before
the Supreme Court, but I now yield to a trial lawyer, at least a
former trial lawyer, Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Watkins and Mr. Greco, I just want to per-
sonally thank you for the efforts that you have put forth here. You
have done a very good job. It has been thorough. It has been pro-
fessional. It is the type of a job we would like to see all ABA inves-
tigations conduct. So I want to compliment both of you, and I agree
with your conclusions.
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you, Senator.
  Mr. GRECO. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact
that you got into this matter of the Bar Association saying that a
lower court judge up for approval has to have trial experience. As
a matter of fact, you go much further than that. You go to the point
of saying that a district court judge has to have practiced within
the last 10 years in the trial court. And I must say that that is--
you are making a face, Mr. Watkins, but I can tell you that in con-
nection with a nomination that I have made, that is exactly what
has been stated; that is, he has not been in the district court or
in a trial court in the last 10 years.
  I do not have any quarrel about Judge Breyer's nomination and
confirmation as far as his not haying been in the lower court trying
cases. I have more difficulty with the Bar Association somehow
concluding that you do not need that experience if you are on the
                                      405
appellate bench or you are on the Supreme Court, but you do need
it if you are a district court judge. I think, frankly, that is a distinc-
tion without a difference, and I think that in one matter that I am
familiar with, that is the only basis on which the Bar Association
is coming forward and saying that a district court nominee is not
qualified because he has not practiced, tried cases within the last
10 years. Everybody else says everything is wonderful about him.

  I just say that I do not think that you are wrong in indicating
that Judge Breyer is an appropriate person to be confirmed as a
Supreme Court Justice. But I think you are terribly wrong, I think
you are totally inconsistent in saying that a lower court judge
needs that experience but an appellate court judge or a Supreme
Court Justice does not. And, basically, I think the original point is
I think you are totally wrong that in order to be a judge you have
to have practiced in the trial courts in the last 10 years.

  I would think that Senator Biden or Senator Hatch might very
well make good Federal court judges. I think I would even be will-
ing to vote for both of them. They have not been in the trial
court

  The CHAIRMAN. DO not get carried away, now. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMON. It might be a close vote on the committee.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, since I have included you both, you
can see how far I am prepared to go. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. YOU can see how radical Howard really is.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Yes; but I have great difficulty in the po-
sition that you have established as a rule of thumb that a nominee
for the district court has to have practiced in--been at trial in the
courts during the previous 10 years.
  Mr. WATKINS. Well, Senator, I know the matter to which you
refer is a very difficult matter for the committee. We looked at it
long and hard, and we had several people evaluate that particular
person. And the committee came out the way it did, not without
great anguish and thought before the results were put together.
  Senator HATCH. Would Senator Metzenbaum yield for just a sec-
ond?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Surely.
  Senator HATCH. I reviewed that whole file, and I think there is
room for question here. I do think I would just caution the Bar As-
sociation that you should look at the total record. And it is cer-
tainly a factor to be considered. But the person that Senator
Metzenbaum has recommended appears to have widespread sup-
port in his community. The person that Senator Biden mentioned,
as far as I am concerned, has played the game the way it should
be played, is a very good person, and frankly, deserves the oppor-
tunity to serve. So I hope the bar will reconsider its position in
this.
  I agree it is a factor. Anybody who is concerned about getting
good judges certainly will have to consider that as a factor. But I
would consider the totality of the person's experience, and in the
case of Senator Metzenbaum's and this other, I personally believe
that they are both very qualified to serve as judges.
  The CHAIRMAN. Put another way, Mr. Watkins, do not be in-
sulted when we disregard your recommendation on those, because
we will disregard your recommendation on Mr. Williams of Mary-
                                                406

land, we will disregard your recommendation on the Senator
Ohio's recommendation, unless there is some other reason that
see. I do not want to discourage you from factoring that in ai.
more than I want to discourage you from factoring in the different
factors you do in the Supreme Court.

  I just want the record to indicate that we truly appreciate the
effort; we appreciate your recommendations

  Senator HATCH. We sure do.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. And hopefully, you appreciate the
fact we are not going to pay attention to some of them.
  Mr. WATKINS. Well, Senator Biden, there are a couple of things.
We recognize that the committee only provides a recommendation.
We are not of the view that we have the right to block any particu-
lar candidate. However, we think that over a period of time, we
have developed the kind of expertise that will give us an ability to
give guidance to this committee and the President that will be
helpful in both venues by the President and by this committee
about making a decision on someone who is going to be a district
court judge or a court of appeals judge or a Supreme Court Justice.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS long as I am chairman of this committee--
which could only last another couple months, possibly--I look at no
other recommendation more closely; I value no other recommenda-
tion more highly; and I think in my 22 years of working with you,
you have found that out. And so I do not mean this as an overall
criticism. It is just something you should be aware of, because as
we broaden the nature of the courts, as this President has be-
come--and others have as well--committed to having the courts re-
flect society more, we are necessarily going to go through changes.
I remember when President Carter was President. He was the first
President to my knowledge who made a concerted effort to find
women to go on the bench. The problem was when you and I grad-
uated law school, we had about 2 percent women in our class--do
not hold me to that number, but it was very small. In my class,
there were 2 women out of 85 that I graduated with. My son grad-
uated from the same law school, and out of a couple hundred grad-
uating, I believe there were more women than men.
  But there used to be a rule, a rule of thumb, that you in fact
would not consider someone for the bench without 10 years' experi-
ence in the legal community. There were not as many women hav-
ing had 10 years' experience in 1976 and 1977--as there are now.
Now every bar association in the Nation, thank God, has a bevy
of qualified women that is equally almost as large, a pool that is
close to as large as men, and we have no trouble--none. The ABA
has no trouble finding women "qualified."
  But we did go through that period where we had the ABA com-
ing, necessarily, based on their rule, saying, well, this person only
has 6 years' experience. And it is generally a good rule. It is gen-
erally a good rule.
  My criticism to the extent there is a criticism is that sometimes
the rule is cast in a way that it is hard and fast, and it overcomes
in and of itself all the other factors, as opposed to it being stated,
"otherwise qualified, but we believe that the lack of trial experience
is enough not to recommend." That is usually not how it is stated.
                                                407

  So we are going through that period now with black Americans,
Hispanic Americans, and interestingly enough, we are having some
difficulty getting young, successful lawyers to look to the bench
now, and we are finding that some of the people who have had ex-
perience of 20, 25 years at the bar, but who have not had trial
practices, are willing to go on the bench.

  So it is an interesting dilemma. It reflects the times. You get
caught up in that crosscurrent--you, the ABA. I think you have
done an admirable job on this and all the other ones that we have
had, but I knew that this issue would be raised. I think it is appro-
priate it be raised. And what I would like to consider doing--and
I will yield now to my friend from Maine--and I know you are will-
ing to do this--I think I would like to, not in a formal hearing, al-
though it may take that form--I have spoken to the president of
the ABA about this--to invite my colleagues on the committee and
any other of my colleagues, and invite you and other members of
the ABA who are involved in this just to come to my office and sit
down and have a long lunch and discuss some of these things; tell
us your thinking about where you see all of this going--not to dis-
cuss any particular candidate--because there is a little bit, as you
could detect, there is sort of a rising level of confusion--I will put
it that way--on the part of Members of the Congress as to motiva-
tion. I do not question the motivation at all. I think it is a useful
thing for us to discuss because it is a slightly different time and
a different cadre of people to whom we are looking to go to the
bench.

  I yield to the Senator from Maine.
  Senator COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I think the discussion has been very helpful. I would like to go
back and just say that I think it is important that they do give due
consideration to trial experience when we are talking about
  The CHAIRMAN. Absolutely.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. U.S. district court judges. I think
trial lawyers are an entirely different breed from corporate lawyers
or real estate lawyers or estate lawyers. A trial lawyer
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. Is someone who has, obviously, a
strong sense of ego, has a
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I do not subscribe to that.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. A good memory
  The CHAIRMAN. I subscribe to that.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. Capable of attacking the jugular,
but basically is an intuitive type of individual--and highly intel-
ligent. The intuitive part of it is critically important in terms of
how one conducts a trial. And I think the trial judge, a U.S. district
court judge or an estate court, for that matter, has to have those
same characteristics. He or she is called upon to make snap deci-
sions based upon experience, ruling on evidence.
  All of those issues, I think, pertain to what type of individual
that person is. So I think that they do give importance and should
give importance to trial experience when you are looking at the
trial court level. But as Senator Biden has said, we ought not to
adopt a rule of thumb in each case instead of a rule of reason.
There may be reasonable factors involved which would cause the

      85-742 - 95 - 14
                                               408

bar to take into consideration that it does not have to be a 10-year
period; it could be an 8 or 7 or 6, depending upon the qualifications
of that individual, his or her demonstrable abilities while practicing
law, while going before the court as a litigator.

  So I think that Senator Biden makes a good recommendation to
see if there is not some flexibility that cannot be adopted so that
we do not find ourselves in the position of simply thumbing our
nose at the ABA, saying, thanks, ladies and gentlemen, but we dis-
agree fundamentally with what you have recommended and just
dismiss it.

  It is a good rule for the most part; and given some flexibility, I
think it would be a really highly workable rule, and I would rec-
ommend that you sit down with committee members and see if we
cannot find a way to take into account some additional flexibility
when we do get candidates who seem extremely well-qualified and
yet have not had the requisite number of years before the trial bar.

  Mr. WATKINS. May I respond, Senator?
  The CHAIRMAN. Please.
  Mr. WATKINS. Our committee has semiannual meetings, and we
try to review what has happened in the past and what is happen-
ing--what will be happening--in the future. And issues are raised
and discussed at the committee level to try and respond to concerns
that people involved in the process have.
  We are constantly looking at our criteria and making sure they
are followed in a fair but flexible way. We have these issues that
have been raised during my tenure as chairman, and you can be
assured that we will try, and we will be raising the question of
flexibility in the application of the standards that we apply, par-
ticularly to district court judges.
  Senator COHEN. I would take just a little bit of issue with my col-
league from Ohio, who indicated that it is a distinction without a
difference between whether or not you have experience at the dis-
trict court level and whether or not you have it at the appellate
court level. I think there is a major distinction to be made. I think
anyone who sits at the appellate court level has a good deal more
time to be reflective; does not have to make those kinds of snap de-
cisions in the heat of battle, so to speak; who brings to bear an en-
tirely different type of intelligence that might be much more ana-
lytical as opposed to intuitive at that case
  The CHAIRMAN. And has two law clerks sitting with him.
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. And has two law clerks sitting with
him--and has time to reflect upon whether or not the evidence and
the facts that were turned by the district court were consistent
with the rulings made at the time as the law applied to them.
  So I think you have two entirely different types of qualifications
for district court and appellate court, and the ABA is correct in ap-
proaching it on that basis. But to the extent that you can have
more flexibility, I think that is something that would be worth-
while exploring.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me make it clear, Mr. Watkins, we are not
attempting to write your rules. The biggest thing I want to do--
and we have talked about this--is that there is a little uprising in
the making in the Senate, and I think if you just are able to ex-
plain the rationale, it would be a very helpful thing.
                                      409
  Now, we have 5 minutes left in the vote. I am going to yield to
the Senator from Illinois to start.
  Senator SlMON. I am just going to take 1 minute and make a re-
quest of Mr. Watkins and Mr. Greco. Yesterday, in response to Sen-
ator Metzenbaum, because of his Lloyd's of London investment,
Judge Breyer indicated where he would recuse himself, sitting on
the Court. I would like to get the copy of that transcript to you yet
this afternoon. I would like you to discuss it with some of your col-
leagues, and I would like to call you on Monday afternoon, if I
could, to get your evaluation.
  I think Judge Breyer is going to be a great U.S. Supreme Court
Justice. I am concerned that he may recuse himself more than is
good for the Court. And I would like to have you take a look at
that, and we will get that to you this afternoon. I will call you on
Monday afternoon.
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you, Senator. We would be happy to look
at that and see if it would make any difference with regard to
Judge Breyer. I cannot think that it--I do not think that it
would
  Senator SlMON. Oh, I do not think it makes a difference in terms
of our vote. I think we should clarify this, if it needs clarification,
before he takes the oath.
  Mr. WATKINS. Fine.
  The CHAIRMAN. Put another way, Mr. Watkins, one of the dilem-
mas that we have had here is that we do not want you--or, at
least, I do not think the Senator from Illinois is suggesting--we do
not want you, the ABA, to tell us whether or not that would change
your view about Judge Breyer. Obviously, it will not and should
not.
  What I think we are all groping for here--and I am not sure this
is the forum in which to do it--is I think the ABA in its sub-
committees that deal with the canons of ethics, I think the Judicial
Conference in its appropriate method of dealing with the canons of
ethics, and I think we who write legislation who can amend the ex-
isting law, should all look together at what is in a sense a case of
first instance, but we are going to have more things like this--to
look and see whether or not there should be additional cir-
cumstances under which a judge should recuse himself.
  But your opinion--I think what the Senator of Illinois is saying
is he respects your personal, individual opinions; we are not look-
ing for a corporate decision from the ABA at this moment.
  Let me suggest to you--and apologize to you for doing this--but
we are going to have to go vote. Senator Grassley has questions.
He is on his way back. I would now authorize Senator Grassley or
whomever arrives back at the podium before I do to take the com-
mittee out of recess and begin their questioning, whoever shows up
first, so we do not slow this process up.
  But let me say again, I truly appreciate the incredible amount
of work that you all do and the good faith with which you do it.
In the 22 years I have been here, I have disagreed on occasion, but
I have never questioned the motivation, nor have I questioned the
scholarship or the intensity of the effort put in by the ABA.
  But these are changing times, and I think it is time to sort of
run the flag back up the pole, make it clear why you do what you
                                      410
do, and give the rationale so we can make a judgment here as to
whether or not we wish to continue to afford you, in effect, you the
ABA, the first seat in the process.

  Now, I see some of my colleagues are here. I would yield to Sen-
ator Specter and keep the hearing going. I am going to go vote, and
I will be back.

  Thank you.
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you for your presence here today, and I
look forward to meeting with you soon.
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you for allowing us to appear.
  Mr. GRECO. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER [presiding]. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair-
man.
  I regret that other commitments prevented my hearing your
opening testimony, but I would join in what Senator Biden said in
thanking you for your work in the judicial evaluation process.
  There has been some interest on our committee and by other
Senators in broadening the array of possible nominees which I un-
derstand is not precisely within the purview of the American Bar
Association, but I would be interested in what you think about it.
I have expressed concern, which is shared by others, that so many
of the Supreme Court Justices--eight of the nine--were appellate
judges elsewhere, seven of those eight from Federal courts of ap-
peals, and one, Justice O'Connor, from the intermediate appellate
court in Arizona.
  Judge Breyer's credentials are excellent, and I think he made a
very good impression on the committee as a whole and on others
during his testimony here.
  But I have been concerned that the same names seem to resur-
face--the great line from "Casablanca," "Round up the usual sus-
pects." Last year, we had a small group under consideration that
included Bruce Babbitt and Steve Breyer, and this year, we had a
small group under consideration that again included Steve Breyer
and Bruce Babbitt.
  And a thought which has been on my mind is to have the Judici-
ary Committee solicit from the chief justices of the State supreme
courts, the chief judges of the courts of appeals, the Federal district
courts, the presidents of the bar associations, and presidents of the
minority bar associations, recommendations to try to broaden the
field, to look for more people who have extraordinary credentials
and perhaps have a broader background in everyday life.
  We had--not to go to a controversial note--Alexander Williams,
who was turned down by the American Bar Association. One of my
staffers, Charity Wilson, made a comment that so many of the
nominees we see are silk-stocking, and Alexander Williams was
with wool socks that had a hole in them, and perhaps had some
diversity which would be helpful. And I expressed my view that it
was unfortunate that Mr. Babbitt was not nominated in the sense
that he is a former Governor, Secretary of the Interior, former
Presidential candidate. Governor Cuomo would have been an excel-
lent prospect.
  And while I understand that you do not pick nominees--nor do
I--what is your thinking about the desirability of having a broader
                                      411
pool to bring to the attention of the President, to give him some
suggestions? We do have an advice function, constitutionally, which
we do not exercise very much. We do too much consenting, perhaps,
and not enough advising. We dissent very infrequently, probably do
not do enough of that.

  What do you think, Mr. Watkins?
  Mr. WATKINS. I would like to comment first about the question
of silk-stocking versus wool stockings. In preparation for that other
hearing to which you referred, we looked at the kinds or the types
of practices of some of our nominees, of the nominees that we eval-
uated, and I think it is not accurate to say that we only give quali-
fied or better ratings to those from silk-stocking firms. Many of the
nominees that we have evaluated are not from silk-stocking firms.
I believe that in the last year since I have been chairman, at least
27 of the candidates that we have found qualified have been mi-
norities, and not all of them have been from silk-stocking firms. So
I wanted to try and straighten that--make that point.
  Second, I think with regard to giving the President a wider view,
a larger list of nominees, I think that is a very good idea. I think
that our committee cannot be involved in that. Our committee is
insulated in that we only evaluate; we do not participate in the se-
lection process, and I do not think that this committee should par-
ticipate in the selection process, because it will make it difficult for
us to fairly and objectively evaluate somebody.
  So I believe that our committee, whatever function it has, should
be limited to the evaluation. Now, if there are other sources from
which the President can obtain a wider group of candidates for him
to select, I think that is a terrific idea, but I do not think that our
committee should be involved in that.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Mr. Watkins, I am not saying your com-
mittee should be, but I do not know that because you pass on quali-
fications, that disqualifies you from making recommendations. The
Senate might be in the same position where you say the Senate has
to vote, or this committee has to vote and make the preliminary de-
termination, but of course, we have an explicit affirmative constitu-
tional duty to advise as well as to consent. But there are plenty of
sources for suggestions even if they do not come from the commit-
tee itself.
  I know that there have been minorities evaluated by your com-
mittee and recommended, and Senator Heinz and I established a
judicial nominating panel, and we have had very extensive out-
reach for minorities, for African-Americans and for women. And
you are not responsible for those who are sent to you, but I believe
that, notwithstanding the efforts of many people, including Presi-
dent Clinton and Presidents Bush and Reagan, to broaden the
base, that there is still a very, very heavy proportion of silk-stock-
ing representation in the Federal judiciary. I think we have a long
way to go on that, and when I saw the memo with Charity Wilson
and the reference to the wool stockings, and the wool stocking with
a hole in it, it struck a chord with me.
  And Judge Breyer went to some length to point out his associa-
tions as a ditch-digger, which I thought was a little thin, and his
contacts with the people, which candidly, I thought was a little
thin, too. I think Judge Breyer has a phenomenal background, com-
                                      412
ing from middle America, with a great education; he clerked for a
Supreme Court Justice and worked for this committee and was a
Harvard law professor and a first circuit judge. Those are extraor-
dinary qualifications, but I do not think it really comes down to the
level of being with the people.

  And the nomination of Justice Thomas I think posed that kind
of a quality, and I might say we are still looking for those qualities
to come forward from Justice Thomas that we do look for--and I
think there is time yet on a career which has decades to span, only
3 years into the career--but those are qualities which we look for,
and we are going to be pressing hard from the committee to try to
give that diversity.

  I think back to the famous story of Senator Borah, who was
chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1930 and was asked by
President Hoover to look at a list of 10 people. Senator Borah
looked at it and said, "I like number 10." It turned out to be
Cardozo, and I think that was quite a selection.

  Let me yield to my colleague, Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. I have no questions.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me yield to my colleague, Senator Grass-
ley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Watkins, we had a chance to speak a few
weeks ago, during the confirmation hearing of Alexander Williams.
  I want to follow up on some things that we discussed at that
time. You testified that the ABA interviews various lawyers in the
community about the nominee, but you do not disclose the names
of the people that are interviewed. Of course, that means that the
nominee does not know who might be making allegations against
them. And, of course, you do not tell the judiciary the identity of
people who have participated in your investigation.
  Is that a fair characterization of how the ABA investigates?
  Mr. WATKINS. That is not quite fair, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK; I will listen to your
  Mr. WATKINS. If there are negative matters that arise during the
course of our investigation, we raise those matters with the can-
didate in a general way so that he has an opportunity to respond
to them.
  There are times when raising a particular matter will identify to
the candidate the person who made the comment. In those cases,
we go back to the interviewee and say to him, well, we have to
raise this issue with the candidate, and if we raise it, your identity
will be revealed. Will you allow us to reveal your identity to the
candidate? Sometimes the interviewees say yes; sometimes they
say no.
  If they say no, then we do not use that interviewee's information.
  Senator GRASSLEY. But as a general rule, then, the idea is that
you will keep the names of the people you have interviewed con-
fidential?
  Mr. WATKINS. We keep the names confidential. We have found
that we get information that sometimes the FBI does not get, and
we can follow up on it. Many times we are able to verify the infor-
mation that is given to us confidentially from other sources that
are public, and if we can do that, then it makes it easy for us to
reveal that information to the candidate.
                                      413
  Senator GRASSLEY. And, obviously, those names are not available
to us on the Judiciary Committee.
  Now, the reason that I ask this is to compare it to the way the
FBI does an investigation of a nominee. The nominee is advised of
any adverse information, is given a chance to respond, and then we
get that entire file for our review, and we look it over, and it is our
responsibility to draw our conclusions.
  In addition, this committee has, of course, an investigative staff,
and as I understand it, an individual must be willing to put his or
her allegation on the record before this committee will act upon it.
And a specific reference to that would be that that was part of Sen-
ator Biden's difficulty with Prof. Anita Hill's allegation in the first
instance. I just use that as an example, not to bring that up again,
but the point is that we want to know who is making allegations.
  It seems to me that as far as this committee is concerned, I guess
maybe as far as Justice and the White House are concerned, the
ABA is given a very special consideration to do those investiga-
tions, keep the names a secret, and then at least as a practical
matter--and I know that as we were discussing last time, you took
exception to my use of the word "veto." I accept that you do not
see your role that way, but as a practical matter, at least during
the Reagan-Bush years, the ABA was given a virtual veto over ju-
dicial nominees.
  If the lawyer will not speak on the record about a nominee, why
would the ABA even pay attention to such secret charges? And I
heard what you said, that you may get some information you would
not otherwise get. But is that such an overriding consideration that
you keep everybody's name secret, keep it from the committee, and
let us draw our conclusions?
  Mr. WATKINS. Let me see if I can respond to that, Senator. We
have found that lawyers talking to lawyers is a process whereby
they speak the same language and they will share things with one
another. That is the first thing.
  It seems to us that it is not unfair to keep the names secret, if
there is any negative information that comes up, that we share
that with the candidate. We do. That is our process. If any negative
information arises and we can share it with the candidate, we do.
And if the negative information comes from a source that the can-
didate will be able to identify, we go back to that source of informa-
tion and say we have to reveal this to the candidate so he can re-
spond.
  If that source says, I do not want you to reveal my name or I
do not want you to indicate this negative information if it would
reveal my identity, then we do not use that information. That infor-
mation is discarded. We do not use it. We do not put it in our re-
port that is circulated to the committee.
  So I think that the candidate is, in effect, given an opportunity
to rebut any negative information that this committee gets and
considers.
  Now, if the candidate is not given that opportunity, I agree with
you, that would be unfair. But that is not the way our committee
works. If there is any negative information, it is shared with the
committee; and if the negative information cannot be shared with
                                      414
the committee--with the candidate, our committee does not con-
sider it.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, if the information is not correlated to
a particular source that the candidate can identify, then he cannot
rebut it because the name is not known. So does he really have a
chance to clarify?

  Mr. WATKINS. Well, let me give you an example. There are times
when there is a quality that comes through that we hear from two
or three sources; for instance, discovery disputes. Those are things
that go on between lawyers about whether documents should be re-
vealed or whether documents should be produced. Over a period of
time, if an individual is known or has been known in the legal com-
munity as someone who hides hot documents or you have to go to
court all the time to get hot documents or documents that should
be produced, if that comes from two or three sources, we can say
to the candidate, Candidate, this issue has arisen in our contacts
about you. What do you have to say about that? And the candidate
can respond, and we will consider what the candidate says; there-
fore, the candidate knows that that is an issue to be dealt with.
But we do not reveal the names.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me just say something in conclusion. You
may want to react. If you want to, I will listen to you. If you do
not want to, it is okay as well. I kind of take off from what I think
is a sincere belief on your part and your committee's part and prob-
ably a historical view that you have. I think over my tenure on this
committee--I did not start out this way, but after some experiences
I think have not been good, I question the special role that the
ABA serves and whether or not it serves any purpose whatsoever.
I think the words you used that expressed your view is that you
feel you have developed some expertise, and out of that expertise,
through this very important process of selecting people for a life-
time tenure on our courts, you can add something to the process.

  I would just use some examples, and maybe I went over this with
you before, but I want to go over it again. I took the Carter admin-
istration as an example. There were four nominees rated not quali-
fied; three were confirmed and one, I believe, served with distinc-
tion because I know how he served--Judge O'Brien in my State. He
is now going to go to senior status, and we are now going through
the process of picking a person to succeed him. But that would
have been 15 or 16 years he served, I believe.

  Now, during later years, we have impeached two Carter era
judges, and another one resigned after conviction, and none of
these were the same individuals that the ABA committee had rated
not qualified. So an ABA evaluation apparently does not bear any
relationship to the likelihood that a judge will have a successful
tenure. And so that is why I continue--I mean, those are just some
examples. There are lots of reasons beyond those examples that I
am going to continue to question the role of the ABA.

  Mr. WATKINS. May I respond?
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU can. I said I would listen to you. I owe
you that courtesy.
  Mr. WATKINS. I believe that those judges that resigned or were
impeached, there were questions of integrity that caused their res-
ignation or impeachment.
                                      415
  Senator GRASSLEY. That is probably very true, but they still were
rated qualified.
  Mr. WATKINS. Right; and I would suggest, although I was not on
the committee when those persons were evaluated, I suggest that
at the time those people were nominated, there was no indication
of their having problems with integrity. That is one of the areas
that I think our committee is almost inflexible about. If there are
integrity problems with a candidate and they are established, I
would believe that our committee would not bend very much.
  One can argue about the question of whether a candidate has
sufficient trial experience or has the appropriate judicial tempera-
ment. On issues of integrity, however, our committee, I would like
to characterize it as firm in that, if there is any question of integ-
rity and it is investigated and our committee is of the opinion that
there is some problem here, I can assure you, Senator, that that
candidate will not be confirmed.
  Now, for those three people that you have referred to, I think
this issue of integrity came after they came on the bench, and it
was their activities while they were on the bench that caused them
to be impeached or resign.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, as important as a nominee's reputation
in his or her legal community might be--and it is very important,
I believe--I hope that in the not too distant future that we will be
able to obtain that information by our own Department of Justice
and our own committee investigative staff.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield the floor.
  Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Grassley.
  Senator Cohen.
  Senator COHEN. I have already had questions.
  Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Greco, I believe, has something to add to what
I said, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I just want to add something along the
line of what Senator Grassley is questioning. You talked about the
fact that if there is a question of integrity, you can be certain that
the person will not be approved.
  Mr. WATKINS. I think if we find that there is a question of integ-
rity, that we can have a basis for questioning a person's integrity,
I would be very surprised if our committee would approve or find
anybody qualified.
  Senator METZENBAUM. What concerns me, Mr. Watkins, is you
are dealing with human beings, and there are reasons at times to
question the integrity of some who are the inquirers themselves,
who are on the committee. And that integrity, we have no way of
assuring ourselves about that, but I personally have concerns about
the integrity of some who have been the inquirers in some of the
cases that have come before this committee. So I think that your
committee ought to give some little thought to that question of not
only judging others but those who are judging being judged them-
selves.
  With that, I think, Mr. Greco, if you have a statement?
  Mr. GRECO. Thank you, Senator. On your point and on the point
that was raised earlier by Senator Grassley, I want to point out
that the American Bar Association is really the messenger. It is not
this committee that makes the final judgments as to whether some-
                                      416
one in a legal community should or should not be given a lifetime
appointment.

  I would hate to see the messenger shot for delivering the mes-
sage from that individual's legal community.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Unless the messenger is tainted in his in-
quiry, then perhaps he deserves to be shot.

  Mr. GRECO. Well, that is an assumption that is a very serious as-
sumption that you are suggesting, Senator. And until that assump-
tion is demonstrated, I think my point is that if you assume that
this committee, which has been in existence for many, many years
and since the early 1950's has been looked to by both the White
House and the Senate for its evaluation, what we do as a commit-
tee is to try to ensure that someone who is appointed for life, some-
one who cannot be removed from judicial office except by a cum-
bersome impeachment process, that that person is qualified, at
least qualified if not well qualified, to be a Federal judge.

  And what concerns me is that criticism of the work of the com-
mittee, the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, is
really slightly off the mark because if--going back to Senator
Cohen's question, if the committee finds that the nominee of the
President is totally lacking in trial experience and the appointment
is for the trial court, for the Federal district court, we are doing
no one a favor. We are not doing the public a favor, we are not
doing trial lawyers a favor, we are not doing the nominee a favor
by putting that person in the cauldron of having to act as a trial
judge. In fact, we are doing just the opposite. Instead of ensuring
justice, perhaps we are creating a situation where injustice will re-
sult.

  The committee standards, the ABA committee standards, are
very broad. We do not have a rigid 10-year rule that if someone has
not been a trial lawyer for 10 years that person will not be consid-
ered. We do not have a rigid rule that says that if a person has
not tried so many cases he or she will not be considered. On the
contrary, our standards are broad enough that where that situation
exists, not enough years at the bar, not enough trials, we look at
other compensating factors, other similar kinds of activities of a
trial nature, other service in the profession.

  So that while we welcome the opportunity to meet with Senator
Biden and others to talk about the standards of the committee, we
believe that the standards are broad enough. And I am getting a
sense from what Senator Biden said earlier that the messenger--
when we deliver a message to your committee that the individual,
the nominee's community, legal community, is of the view that the
person is lacking in one way or another, that it is the messenger
being shot rather than the message being heard that we try to
communicate from that nominee's legal community.

  The CHAIRMAN. We are not going to shoot anybody. We just want
to keep this dialog going. I thank you both very, very much for
being here. Again, thank you for the extraordinary amount of effort
you have put into this in taking the time out of your practices.

  Mr. GRECO. Thank you, Senator.
  Mr. WATKINS. Thank you for having us.
  The CHAIRMAN. I look forward to seeing you very soon, Mr. Wat-
kins.
                                         417

  Mr. WATKINS. YOU are very kind, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am serious. I do want to talk to you about
this.

  [The letter of Mr. Watkins follows:]

                                                                       AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION,
                                                  STANDING COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL JUDICIARY,

                                                                 Washington, DC, July 11, 1994.

Hon. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.,

Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington,
     DC.

  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter I submitted in response to the invitation from
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to the Standing Committee on Federal Judi-
ciary of the American Bar Association (the "Committee") to present its report re-
garding the nomination of the Honorable Stephen G. Breyer to be an Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  The Committee's evaluation of Chief Judge Breyer is based on an investigation
of his professional qualifications, that is, his integrity, judicial temperament and
professional competence. Consistent with long standing policy, the Committee did
not undertake any examination or consideration of Chief Judge Breyer's political
ideology or his views on any issues that might come before the Supreme Court.

  To merit the Committee's evaluation of Qualified or Well Qualified the Supreme
Court nominee must be at the top of the legal profession, have outstanding legal
ability and wide experience and meet the highest standards of integrity, professional
competence and judicial temperament. The evaluation of Well Qualified is reserved
for those found to merit the Committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.

   I am pleased to report that the Committee finds Chief Judge Breyer to be Well
Qualified for appointment as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Unit-
ed States. This determination was unanimous.

  In conducting the investigation, members of the Committee personally inter-
viewed more than 300 federal judges, including present and retired members of the
Supreme Court of the United States, members of the Federal Courts of Appeals,
members of the Federal District Courts, Federal Magistrate Judges, Federal Bank-
ruptcy Judges, and members of State Courts. The investigation included all col-
leagues of Chief Judge Breyer on the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit, all Federal District Court Judges from the District of Massachusetts, and
all the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Numerous federal
and state court judges from the other states in the First Circuit were also inter-
viewed.

  Members of the Committee personally questioned several hundred other individ-
uals, including practicing lawyers throughout the United States, former law clerks
and lawyers who have appeared before Chief Judge Breyer. Committee members
also interviewed law school deans, faculty members of law schools and constitutional
scholars throughout the United States, including professors at Harvard Law School,
where Chief Judge Breyer has served on the faculty since 1967.

   The Committee also had available the report prepared in 1980 by the Committee
in connection with the investigation of Chief Judge Breyer for appointment to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. He was at that time found by
a majority of the Committee to be Qualified and by a substantial minority Well
Qualified for appointment to that Court.

   It has been the practice of the Committee to ask groups of distinguished legal
scholars and Supreme Court practitioners to review independently all of the opin-
ions written by nominees for the Supreme Court. This practice was followed again
here and Chief Judge Breyer's opinions were reviewed by: (1) a Reading Group of
distinguished lawyers chaired by Rex E. Lee, formerly Solicitor General of the Unit-
ed States and presently President of Brigham Young University, consisting of a di-
verse group of 10 lawyers, all of whom have practices and argued cases in the Su-
preme Court; and (2) a reading Group chaired by Professor Nicholas S. Zeppos of
Vanderbilt University School of Law, consisting of 26 members of that law school's
faculty. Members of the two Reading Groups who participated are listed on Exhibit
A to this letter.

  The two Reading Groups reported to the Committee their independent analyses
of Chief Judge Breyer's opinions and other writings. These reports were evaluated
by the members of our Committee, who also read opinions of Chief Judge Breyer
and his published writings on a variety of legal subjects.

                                                          EVALUATION

                                                            INTEGRITY

   Chief Judge Breyer has earned and enjoys an excellent general reputation for his
integrity and character. No one interviewed by the Committee had any question or
doubt in this regard. His colleagues in the First Circuit, where he has served for
fourteen years, the last four as Chief Judge, commented on his character and integ-
rity in terms such as these: "He is absolutely first rate, a remarkable combination
of one who has character and is intelligent, yet is a personable and likable human
being"; "He is eminently well qualified, of the highest character"; "He combines
acute intelligence and a deep sense of humanity. He is a down to earth human being
who is very smart. This is simply a superb appointment."

                                                         TEMPERAMENT

   Chief Judge Breyer's judicial temperament also meets the highest standards set
by the Committee for appointment to the Supreme Court.

   His colleagues on the First Circuit and on the Harvard Law School faculty who
have worked with him for up to twenty-five years, Federal District Court judges,
former law clerks, his secretary of almost fourteen years, and counsel who have ar-
gued cases before him, uniformly give Chief Judge Breyer the highest praise for his
demeanor, temperament, and manner of treating people. The Court of Appeals
Judges in the First Circuit universally credit Chief Judge Breyer for the strong
collegiality that exists in the Circuit, for his remarkable ability to build consensus,
for his sensitivity and good grace, and for his outstanding leadership skills.

  Representative comments from his colleagues on the First Circuit Court of Ap-
peals include these: "He does not browbeat, and he is a genius at forging consensus
and compromise"; "He has a wonderful temperament"; "He is universally well liked
and respected by all of us on the Court"; "He can soften rigid positions with gentle
humor"; "He is a master at getting consensus on court decisions"; "He has very good
judgment, is stimulating to be around, and is not arrogant."

   District Court Judges in the First Circuit also praised Chief Judge Breyer's judi-
cial temperament: "He is a great leader"; "He is humane, not impressed with his
own intelligence, which is extremely powerful"; "He has great sensitivity toward
lower court judges * * * he doesn't hold anyone up to ridicule, as other appellate
judges do sometimes"; "As Chief Judge of the First Circuit he has been superb, a
true leader"; "He is very well liked by all the members of the First Circuit commu-
nity. The Court's strong collegiality is directly attributable to Steve Breyer's wonder-
ful personal skills"; "He is a brilliant judge"; "He conducts himself beautifully on the
bench--bright and a perfect gentleman."

  To the same effect are the comments of his colleagues on the Harvard Law School
faculty, his former law clerks and the lawyers who have argued cases before him.
Chief Judge Breyer clearly possesses and exhibits the highest level of judicial tem-
perament.

                                              PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE

   Chief Judge Breyer's educational background amply prepared him for service on
the Supreme Court of the United States. He attended public schools in San Fran-
cisco, graduated from Stanford University in 1959 with highest honors in philoso-
phy, attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar, receiving First Class Hon-
ors, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1964, Magna Cum Laude. He
served as Articles Editor of the Harvard Law Review. After law school he served
as Law Clerk to Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg.

   Following his Clerkship on the Supreme Court, Chief Judge Breyer began a career
with the Federal Government and then an academic career at Harvard Law School,
where he has been a member of the faculty since 1967.

   His service with the Federal Government included the positions of Special Assist-
ant to the Assistant Attorney General (Antitrust); Assistant Special Prosecutor, Wa-
tergate Special Prosecution Force, U.S. Department of Justice; Special Counsel, Ad-
ministrative Practices Sub-Committee, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary; and
Chief Counsel, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. He was appointed to the First Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals in 1980, and became Chief Judge in 1990. During the years
1985-^-89 he was a Member of the United States Sentencing Commission, and played
a major role in the drafting of the Sentencing Guidelines. His twenty-seven year af-
filiation with Harvard Law School has included the positions of Assistant Professor,
Professor, and, since becoming a Judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Lec-
turer.
                                         419

  He has developed and maintained broad interests. Throughout his career he has
participated actively in legal organizations and has lectured extensively about legal
education. He is an active Member of the American Law Institute, and has also
been a Member of a Carnegie Commission group studying the relation of science
and the courts (Task Force on Science and Technology in Judicial and Regulatory
Decision Making). He has participated actively in the work of the American Bar As-
sociation (ABA), in particular as a Member of the Council of the ABA Administra-
tive Law Section and the select ABA Committee on Ethics in Government.

  During his fourteen years as a Judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals he
has written approximately 600 opinions and numerous books, monographs, and arti-
cles which are most impressive, and which establish quite clearly that he is a schol-
ar of the first rank. In addition to his extensive writings, he has delivered numerous
Honorary Lectures during the past eleven years, including the prestigious Holmes
Lectures at Harvard University which were published in book form by Harvard Uni-
versity Press in 1993 in a volume entitled Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Ef-
fective Risk Regulation.

  The legal opinions that he has written during his fourteen years on the First Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals coyer wide-ranging subjects. He has taken special interest in
Administrative Law (which he has taught at Harvard Law School), in government
regulatory matters, msot notably airline deregulation, and the Sentencing Guide-
lines. Chief Judge Breyer was praised repeatedly during the Committee's investiga-
tion for his excellent writing skills. His colleagues on the First Circuit call him "bril-
liant" and "a genius" in crafting legal opinions. Federal District Court Judges, even
those he has reversed in appellate opinions, praise highly Chief Judge Breyer's writ-
ing and analytical skills. Numerous Federal District Court Judges remarked that
Chief Judge Breyer writes so clearly (without footnotes) that a District Court Judge
knows precisely what is expected of him or her in an appellate opinion written by
Chief Judge Breyer. Chief Judge Breyer's writings reflect a higher level of scholar-
ship required of a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States

   The comprehensive reports submitted to the Committee by the two Reading
Groups of scholars and Supreme Court practitioners confirm the Committee's own
conclusions concerning the scholarship and writing ability of Chief Judge Breyer.
The Chairman of one of the two reading groups summarized his colleagues' assess-
ment of Chief Judge Breyer's opinions and other writings as follows:

        Judge Breyer is a person of enornmous intellectual ability with an out-
     standing ability to write clearly and persuasively. His opinions reflect a
     wide breadth of knowledge about the law and an overriding commitment to
     deeply principled and objective decision making. His work is evidence of a
     judge keenly aware of the power and corresponding responsibility that go
     with his office.
   The Chairman of the other Reading Group summarized his colleagues' assessment
of chief Judge Breyer's writings as follows:

        Judge Breyer's scholarly ability was praised by virtually every Committee
     member. He was found to "display the intellectual habits associated with
     the most respected thinking of our times: a preference for the complex over
     the simple and the particular over the general, a willingness to suspend
     judgment, and a robust tolerance of conceptual ambiguity." His opinions,
     furthermore, repeatedly demonstrate "a realistic assessment" of "evolging
     case law," and "are generally well-researched and complete without being
     pedantic." "Whenever there is a significant debate about * * * applicable
     legal principles, Judge Breyer exhibits a determined effort to analyze and
     apply the governing doctrine * * * his work product is not only scholarly,
     it is also "free from recrimination or insinuation, even when he seems plain-
     ly skeptical. Judge Breyer's opinions are "careful * * *, tolerant and po-
     lite."

   The same Reading Group Chairman perhaps best summarized the reasons why
both Reading Groups have praised the excellence of Chief Judge Breyer writing and
scholarship in the following words:

        He is a lawyer's lawyer and a judge's judge. He is careful, scholarly, dis-
     passionate, and objective. Furthermore, he recognizes that there are limits
     to his own abilities, as a jurist, to resolve every dispute engendered by the
     contentious press of modern life.
   Our Committee is fully satisfied that Chief Judge Breyer meets the highest stand-
ard of professional competence required for a seat on the Supreme Court. His aca-
demic training, his broad experience in the Federal Government, his service on the
                                             420

faculty of a distinguished law school, his scholarly writings and his distinguished
service for fourteen years (four as Chief Judge) on the Court of Appeals dealing with
many of the same kinds of matters that will come before the Supreme Court, fully
established his professional competence.

                                                         CONCLUSION

  Based on the information available to it, the Committee is of the unanimous opin-
ion that Chief Judge Breyer is Well Qualified for appointment to the Supreme Court
of the United States. This is the Committee's highest rating for a Supreme Court
nominee.

  The Committee will review its report at the conclusion of the public hearings and
notify you if any circumstances have developed that would require a modification
of these views.

  On behalf of our Committee, I wish to thank you and the Members of the Judici-
ary Committee for the invitation to participate in the Confirmation Hearings on the
nomination of the Honorable Stephen G. Breyer to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

        Respectfully submitted,

                                                                                      ROBERT P. WATKINS, Chair.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, our next distinguished panel is comprised
of two well-known members of the legal academic community, both
from Stanford University, Judge Breyer's alma mater. Gerhard
Casper is a distinguished scholar and administrator. He is presi-
dent of Stanford University, which I am sure he finds as politically
trying as any one of us up here. He will not acknowledge that, I
suspect, or maybe he does not believe that. But it would seem to
me the next hardest job--maybe the harder job is being the presi-
dent of a major, nationally known, and internationally recognized
university. He is a former dean of the University of Chicago School
of Law, and I want to ask him how he hired all those law and eco-
nomics guys and women out there--that is a joke, an attempt at
a joke--and provost at that university. He became president of
Stanford in 1992.

  And if I do not run the risk of ruining your reputation, we also
have an old acquaintance and friend, Kathleen Sullivan, who has
moved from coast to coast here, who was kind enough to try to edu-
cate me, which was a very difficult job--as a Senator, not educate
me in her classroom. Professor Sullivan was then a professor of law
at Harvard Law School and is now a professor of law at Stanford.
And she is an expert on constitutional and criminal law, someone
I have personally called on a number of times when I have needed
legal advice for the committee, and I welcome her here as well.

  So I would invite you, Mr. President--we do not often get to use
that phrase here in the hearing--to begin your testimony, if you
would.

PANEL CONSISTING OF GERHARD CASPER, PRESIDENT, STAN-
  FORD UNIVERSITY, PALO ALTO, CA; AND KATHLEEN M. SUL-
  LIVAN, PROFESSOR, STANFORD UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL,
  PALO ALTO, CA

                   STATEMENT OF GERHARD CASPER

  Mr. CASPER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your very
generous opening remarks. I am glad there is one person in the
country who recognizes how challenging and interesting the life of
a university president is.
                                      421
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, there will soon be another one. There will
soon be President David Boren, former Senator who will be presi-
dent of the University of Oklahoma, and he is going to find out and
tell us all what it is like.
  Mr. CASPER. I was bemused by his expectation that life might be
easier at the university than in the U.S. Senate. [Laughter.]
  It is a great privilege, indeed, to appear before you in support of
President Clinton's nomination of Judge Breyer for the Supreme
Court. I have been acquainted with Stephen Breyer's work
throughout most of my professional life. In my still relatively new
position as president of Stanford University, I can, as the chairman
pointed out, happily claim Judge Breyer as an alumnus of the uni-
versity, but I am, of course, not testifying in my role as president.
  One of the great American judges of this century, Henry Friend-
ly, who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
in a paper about Justice Cardozo, once referred to what is required
in a judge. Among the requirements is, of course, that a judge
needs to be a lawyer of "the highest grade." But a judge also needs
to be somebody who seeks wisdom and is "blessed with saving com-
mon sense and practical experience as well as sound and com-
prehensive learning."
  Judge Breyer is a lawyer of the highest grade. He has sought op-
portunities to do the work of a lawyer in all three branches of the
Federal Government. Indeed, I know few men or women who could
match his varied legal experience in this respect.
  In the executive branch, he served in the Antitrust Division of
the Justice Department. He also was a prosecutor in the Watergate
Special Prosecutor's Office. In Congress, he was chief counsel to
this important committee. In the judiciary, he started out at the
Supreme Court, to which I hope you will return him, and, since
1980, has been one of the most distinguished Federal appellate
judges.
  He has even worked what you might call among the branches
through his service as a charter member of the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, one of those hybrid interbranch agencies that seem to
partake of all branches at one and the same time. As a student of
the separation of powers, I wish I had had a similar in-depth expo-
sure to the workings of American Government.
  In the last few months, I have seen the press frequently refer to
Judge Breyer as pragmatic. This is not a bad attribute, provided
it is not intended to suggest that Judge Breyer prefers any result
over no result. The opposite is true. Throughout his life, he has
been interested in the right results. In that sense, I have always
thought of Stephen Breyer as a man of strong ideals who thinks
and worries much about justice, about the ends we pursue, the
means we employ towards those ends, and what effects they will
have.
  In his recent book, "Breaking the Vicious Circle," he expresses
the belief that trust in institutions arises from openness, but also
from those institutions doing a difficult job well. I quote: "A So-
cratic notion of virtue--the teachers teaching well, the students
learning well, the judges judging well, and the health regulators
more effectively bringing about better health--must be central in
                                             422

any effort to create the politics of trust." Trust in institutions
should be one of our highest priorities.

  Judge Breyer's public service reflects "a saving common sense
and practical experience." These qualities can also be found in his
writings. His approach to the issue of societal risk management is
marked by "a saving common sense." In this instance, the attribute
"saving" may be taken quite literally, since Breyer favors foregoing
those regulatory gains and risk management that are too small in
relation to the resources they consume. What is saved can be ap-
plied to other national needs and social priorities.

  I referred to Judge Breyer's "Socratic notion of virtue," which in-
cludes that judges should judge well. The first prerequisite of judg-
ing well is to judge clearly. Reading Breyer opinions is a genuine
pleasure--perhaps, as he has suggested, even "for a high school
student," though I confess to doubts on that count. His opinions are
so written that you understand every step of the way: what the
parties argue, what evidence they rely upon, what the judge under-
stands to be the state of the law, what the uncertainties are, how
he intends to resolve them and why, how the judge views the facts,
and, finally, the conclusions all of this leads him to. One can read-
ily agree or disagree with Judge Breyer because he is clear about
where he stands.

  In the era of administrative government, we should consider our-
selves fortunate that the nominee is one of the country's leading
experts on administrative law who has a mature understanding of
the Constitution and the requirements that follow from a commit-
ment to the rule of law. Perhaps the most important question con-
cerning trust that the country faces for the foreseeable future is
who will control administrative government and how. In order to
cope with that challenge, the Supreme Court needs much wise un-
derstanding of how the institutions of government work. It is my
belief that Judge Breyer will bring that understanding to the
Court, in addition to his commitment to the Constitution and the
rule of law.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and other members of the
committee.

                                BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GERHARD CASPER

  Born in 1937, Gerhard Casper grew up in Hamburg, the port city on the Elbe
River. At sixteen he made his first trip to the United States, as one of 32 students
from around the world who came to the United Nations for the New York Herald
Tribune Forum for High Schools, a program intended to promote international un-
derstanding.

  Mr. Casper studied law at the Universities of Freiburg and Hamburg, where in
1961 he earned his first law degree. He came to Yale Law School in 1961, obtaining
his Master of Laws degree a year later. He then returned to Freiburg, where he re-
ceived his Doctorate in 1964, writing his dissertation on the realist movement in
American law.

  In the fall of 1964, Mr. Casper emigrated to the United States spending two years
as Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California at Berke-
ley. In 1966 he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School, and be-
tween 1979 and 1987 served as Dean of the Law School. He has written and taught
primarily in the fields of constitutional law, constitutional history, comparative law,
and jurisprudence. From 1977 to 1991 he was an editor of The Supreme Court Re-
view. He was named the William B. Graham Professor of Law in 1980, and a Distin-
guished Service Professor in 1987. He is a member of the American Law Institute
and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
                                             423

  In 1989 Mr. Casper became Provost of the University of Chicago, a post he held
until he accepted the presidency of Stanford University in 1992. He also holds an
appointment as Professor of Law at Stanford.

  Mr. Casper is married to Regina Casper, M.D. Dr. Casper was a Professor of Psy-
chiatry at the University of Chicago before taking an appointment as Professor of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Science in the School of Medicine at Stanford. She is an
authority in the area of depression and eating disorders.

  The Caspers have one daughter, Hanna, who is a graduate of Yale University and
the University of Virginia Law School.

  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: It is a great privilege, indeed, to
appear before you in support of President Clinton's nomination of Judge Breyer for
the Supreme Court. I have been acquainted with Stephen Breyer's work throughout
most of my professional life. He and I started teaching law at about the same time
in the sixties. In my still relatively new position as president of Stanford University,
I can happily claim Judge Breyer as an alumnus of the university, but I am, of
course, not testifying in my role as president.

              STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you very much to the chairman for his gen-
erous introduction, to the chairman and the members of the com-
mittee for the privilege of allowing me to testify here. It is a great
honor and a great pleasure and easy task to testify in enthusiastic
support for Judge Breyer's nomination to the Supreme Court. I had
the privilege and pleasure of serving as his colleague in nearly a
decade that we were both on the Harvard Law School faculty, and
I know his opinions and his academic writings well.
  I would like to focus briefly here today on three features of Judge
Breyer's excellent virtues for the Court. The first is his pragmatic
philosophy. Second is the excellence of his legal craft. And the third
is his judicious temperament.
  Now, the committee has heard a great deal from Judge Breyer
himself in the last few days about his pragmatism. He has said to
you here, as he has said in his writings, that the law is a pro-
foundly human institution. It is designed to allow the many dif-
ferent individuals who make up America from so many different
backgrounds and circumstances to live together productively, har-
moniously, and in freedom. It is a human institution serving basic
human or societal needs.
  And he has said that it must be a practical effort, and many
might think, well, this is all very good to be practical. It sounds
sound. But is it a judicial philosophy? And my key point before the
committee today is that I would like to emphasize that pragmatism
is a coherent judicial philosophy. And, indeed, it is the philosophy
of the 20th century Court.
  Judge Breyer, in his pragmatism, is the spiritual heir of the
great Justices of the Court in this century. Most especially, we can
start with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes from Senator Kennedy's
home State, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This came up in
the colloquy with Senator Cohen and others on the committee the
other day. Judge Breyer is the spiritual heir of Justice Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes in the following sense: He sees, as Holmes did, that
law is not an intellectual exercise in abstract theory. Rather, the
law, including constitutional law, is a practical enterprise rooted in
the complexity of actual social life.
  As Justice Holmes put the point in perhaps his most famous aph-
orism, 'The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experi-
ence." That is why pragmatism rejects the notion that legal or con-
stitutional interpretation can be reduced to any single grand uni-
fied theory, any simple, overarching approach.
  Judge Breyer, as a pragmatist in the tradition of Holmes, instead
takes a flexible, undogmatic view of the tools that are relevant to
                                             425

interpreting the Constitution and the laws passed by the political
bodies. Whether interpreting a statute or a constitutional provision,
he would look to text and structure and history and tradition and
precedent and the way we live today and the way we might live
in the future as his guides to meaning. He would not rigidly limit
himself to any of these tools alone.

  Pragmatism likewise stresses the need for flexibility and adapt-
ability over time, so that the law, including constitutional law, may
continue to serve its underlying purposes amid changed cir-
cumstances. As Judge Breyer stressed in his testimony, the Con-
stitution must be read in light of its purposes, just as statutes
must be read in light of theirs.

  Now, such reasoning is really in the mainstream of the greatest
thought of 20th century Justices on the Court, from Holmes at the
beginning of the century, to Harlan in an era closer to our own
time. Justice Harlan captured pragmatism's look at the flexibility
needed in law in his famous saying that due process cannot be re-
duced to any formula and its content cannot be determined by ref-
erence to any code.

  Now, you might say that is very well and good, but does prag-
matism have any problems? And one might ask three questions
about pragmatism, and I think the answer in Judge Breyer's case
is very satisfactory as to all three.

  One might ask, first of all, does pragmatism mean that the judge
is just going to do what he thinks is best according to his own light,
what he thinks is practical or good? And there the answer is most
clear from Judge Breyer's record: Absolutely not.

  As Judge Breyer's mentor, the late Justice Arthur Goldberg for
whom he clerked once wrote

   In determining which rights are fundamental, judges are not left at large to de-
cide cases in light of their personal and private notions. Rather, they must look to
the "traditions and conscience of our people" * * * [and to] "experience with the re-
quirements of a free society."

  Tradition, our people, our conscience, our experience, outside
himself.

  Judge Breyer, as he himself assured the committee on Tuesday,
has said that the job of a judge is not to legislate from the bench,
but to look outside himself to those guides to meaning in order to
follow the law laid down.

  Pragmatism is a philosophy of judicial humility, not judicial arro-
gance. It holds that, as Holmes said, general propositions cannot
decide concrete cases, and that adjudication between two competing
legal claims is necessarily a matter of degree.

  And one might ask, second, well, all right, I accept that prag-
matism is respectful law, and a pragmatic judge will look outside
himself and be guided by our history, our tradition, our precedent.
But does this mean that he will decide things in an ad hoc fashion,
that he will issue decisions that will only last for a time? And
there, again, the answer is, in Judge Breyer's case, most clearly
"no".

  As Judge Breyer himself has emphasized in his testimony, a
pragmatist judge looks not only backward to our traditions but for-
ward to how the law can be an authoritative and predictable guide.
                                             426

Of necessity, such an approach embodies deep respect for demo-
cratic institutions and the will of the community.

  Third, though, one might say, well, with all this respect for law
and history and tradition and precedent and the will of the commu-
nity, will a pragmatist judge like Judge Breyer sacrifice constitu-
tional rights? Absolutely not. Again, the answer is clear. Absolutely
not. Judge Breyer's record is quite clear that when rights are clear-
ly embodied in the Constitution or in statute, he has not hesitated
boldly and squarely to uphold them, whether rights of free speech,
free conscience, rights to equal protection of the law.

  In sum, Judge Breyer's thoughtful commitment to pragmatism
places him squarely in the mainstream of this century's most im-
portant judicial philosophy and allies him with the Court's most
powerful and influential Justices from Harlan to Holmes.

  I will be brief on the second two points. I would like to say in
addition

  The CHAIRMAN. Kathleen, it is only our friendship that is allow-
ing you to go beyond your 5 minutes, but go ahead.

  Ms. SULLIVAN. TWO sentences, Mr. Chairman. First, should not
confuse--there has been talk of lack of passion. Is this man so
pragmatic he has no passion? We should not confuse passion with
commitment to justice and fairness, and I think Justice Breyer's
opinions, like Judge Breyer's opinions, will be marked by a kind of
superior craftsmanship and legal excellence that enables him to
bring about justice and fairness in a way that might be more en-
during than the efforts of mere passion alone.

  And, last, he is, as you have seen and as others have testified--
and I wholly concur--a man of great evenhandedness and open-
mindedness. He has the qualities of spirit as well as mind to be one
of the great Justices on the Supreme Court in this century.

  Thank you very much.

                           BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

  Kathleen M. Sullivan is Professor of Law at Stanford Law School. She was pre-
viously Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she taught from 1984 to
1993. Her specialty is constitutional law. She has published articles on a wide range
of constitutional issues, including affirmative action, abortion, unconstitutional con-
ditions, freedom of religion and freedom of speech. She wrote the 1992 Forward to
the Supreme Court issue of the Harvard Law Review.

  Professor Sullivan has served as co-counsel in a number of Supreme Court cases,
including Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, Freytag v. Commissioner, Rust v. Sullivan,
Bowers v. Hardwick, Puerto Rico v. Branstad, Fisher v. City of Berkley, and Hawaii
Housing Authority y. Midkiff. She has commented on various constitutional issues
on The New York Times op-ed page and the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hours.

  Professor Sullivan holds degrees from Cornell University (B.A. 1976), Oxford Uni-
versity (B.A. 1978), and Harvard Law School (J.D. 1981). At Oxford, she was a Mar-
shall Scholar. In 1981-82, she served as law clerk to Judge James L. Oakes of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Secord Circuit.

                           PREPARED STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me to ap-
pear before this distinguished Committee. It is both a great honor and a great pleas-
ure to testify in enthusiastic support of the nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer
to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court. I have known Judge
Breyer for over a decade, as we were colleagues on the Harvard Law School faculty
before I moved west to Stanford Law School. I have closely followed his opinions
                                             427

and his academic writings over the years. I believe that he will be an exemplary
Supreme Court Justice, and will bring great credit to the Court.

  Three features of Judge Breyer's approach to law and judging lead me to that con-
clusion. First is his thoroughly pragmatic philosophy, which is in keeping with the
best of the Supreme Court's traditions over the last century. Second is the excel-
lence of his legal craftsmanship. Third is his judicious temperament. Allow me to
address each feature in turn.

   1. Pragmatic philosophy. Throughout his opinions and other writings, Judge
Breyer has expressed a view of law as a practical enterprise, to be applied in a prac-
tical way for practical ends. Just the other day, in his opening statement to the
Committee, he summarized this view as follows: "I believe that law must work for
people. That vast array of Constitution, statutes, rules, regulations, practices, proce-
dures--that huge, vast web--has a single basic purpose. That purpose is to help the
many different individuals who make up America from so many different back-
grounds and circumstances, with so many different needs and hopes * * * live to-
gether productively, harmoniously, and in freedom." The New York Times, July 13,
1994 (national edition), at A8.

  That statement echoes Judge Breyer's previous statements in other contexts. For
example, in a 1991 lecture he delivered at USC on statutory interpretation, he said,
"I assume that law itself is a human institution, serving basic human or societal
needs. It is therefore properly subject to praise, or to criticism, in terms of certain
pragmatic values, including both formal values, such as coherence and workability,
and widely shared substantive values, such as helping to achieve justice by inter-
preting the law in accordance with the 'reasonable expectations' of those to whom
it applies." On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 So. Cal.
L. Rev. 845, 847 (1992).

  Likewise, in a 1989 tribute to his late Harvard colleague Paul Bator, Judge
Breyer praised the legal tradition that "sees law, including constitutional law, as an
untidy body of understandings among groups and institutions, inherited from the
past, open to change mostly at the edges. It is a tradition that communicates its
important vision, not through the explication of any single theory, but through de-
tailed study of cases, institutions, history, and the human needs that underlie
them." 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1737, 1744 (1989).

   In expressing these views, Judge Breyer has situated himself squarely within the
great and distinctively American tradition that has dominated the Supreme Court
throughout this century: namely, legal pragmatism. The pragmatic tradition links
the opinions of the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes at the beginning of the cen-
tury with those of Justice John Marshall Harlan and his admirers in our own era.
And this tradition continues overwhelmingly to predominate among the Justices
who sit on the Supreme Court today.

   Pragmatism sees law not as an intellectual exercise in abstract theory, but rather
as a practical enterprise rooted in the complexity of actual social life. As Justice
Holmes put this point in his most famous aphorism, "The life of the law has not
been logic: it has been experience." O.W. Holmes, The Common Law 5 (1881). See
generally Thomas C. Grey, Holmes and Legal Pragmatism, 41 Stan. L. Rev. 787
(1989).

   Pragmatism rejects the notion that legal or constitutional interpretation can be
reduced to any one grand unified theory or single, simple, overarching approach.
Thus, Judge Breyer, as a pragmatic judge, takes a flexible, undogmatic view of the
tools relevant to legal interpretation. Whether interpreting a statute or a constitu-
tional provision, he would look to text and structure and history and tradition as
his guides to meaning, rather than rigidly limiting himself to any one of these tools
alone.

   Pragmatism likewise stresses the need for legal flexibility and adaptability over
time, so that the law, including constitutional law, may continue to serve its under-
lying purposes amid changed circumstances. As Judge Breyer stressed to the Com-
mittee in his testimony on Tuesday, citing the pragmatist Justice Holmes himself,
the Constitution cannot be read to enact any particular economic theory that would
hamstring government "if the world changes so that it becomes crucially important
to all of us that we protect the environment, that we protect health, that we protect
safety. * * *" New York Times, supra. Such reasoning is in the mainstream of the
Court's pragmatic tradition, once captured by Justice Harlan in his famous saying
that "due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be deter-
mined by reference to any code." Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542 (1961) (Harlan,
J., dissenting).

   Does pragmatism mean that a judge seeks to impose his own preferences on the
law? Absolutely not. As Judge Breyer's mentor, the late pragmatist Justice Arthur
Goldberg, once wrote, "In determining which rights are fundamental, judges are not
                                             428

left at large to decide cases in light of their personal and private notions. Rather,
they must look to the 'traditions and conscience of our people' * * * [and to] 'experi-
ence with the requirements of a free society.'" Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.
479, 493 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring). And as Judge Breyer himself assured the
Committee in his testimony on Tuesday, a Justice's JOD is certainly not to "legislate
from the bench," but rather to follow the law--although determining just what an
open-ended law really means may demand all the resources of his judicial craft.
Pragmatism is a philosophy of judicial humility, not judicial arrogance: it holds that
general propositions cannot decide concrete cases, and that adjudication between
two competing legal claims is necessarily a matter of degree.

  Does pragmatism mean that a judge resolves legal disputes in an ad hoc way?
Again, the answer is clearly no. As Judge Breyer himself has emphasized, a prag-
matist judge looks not only backward to our traditions, but also forward to how his
ruling will achieve present peace and future stability by resolving disputes in an
authoritative manner that enables people to predict what the next case will hold.
Of necessity, such an approach embodies deep respect for democratic institutions
and the will of the community.

  On the other hand, does pragmatism sacrifice constitutional rights to the social
welfare of the community? Once again, in Judge Breyer's hands it most assuredly
does not. As he has stressed, our most basic laws are designed to protect not only
harmony but also freedom. And when rights are clearly embodied in the text of the
Constitution or a statute, Judge Breyer has not hesitated strongly to uphold them,
whatever the will of the community might be.

  For example, as he told the Committee on Tuesday, the Constitution "foresees
over the course of history that a person's right to speak freely and to practice his
religion is something that is of value [and thus] is not going to change. New York
Times, supra. Accordingly, he has ruled for his Court that the First Amendment
plainly bars government from targeting either one's political or one's religious views.
See, e.g., Ozonoffs. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224 (1st Cir. 1984); Aman v. Handler, 653 F.2d
41 (1st Cir. 1981). Likewise, he held for his Court in Stathos v. Bowden, 728 F. 2d
15 (1st Cir. 1984), that no matter what conventional attitudes about sex roles might
be, an employer violates the most basic notions of equality if he pays women less
than men just because they were women."

  In sum, Judge Breyer's thoughtful commitment to a pragmatic judicial philosophy
places him squarely in the mainstream of the century's most important and endur-
ing jurisprudential tradition, and allies him with the Court's most powerful and in-
fluential Justices. And this legal pragmatism is thoroughly consistent both with the
rule of law and the role of individual rights.

  2. Legal craftsmanship. Judge Breyer's judicial opinions during his tenure on the
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit are marked by clear thought, careful analysis,
close reasoning, and precision of language. Eschewing footnotes and legal jargon,
Judge Breyer has a gift for boiling down highly complicated matters to their basic
core, and expressing legal opinions with compelling simplicity. In keeping with his
view of law as a practical enterprise, he cares deeply that his decisions can be read-
ily understood. He writes his opinions to be watertight, so that even people of differ-
ing views might find they can agree upon them.

  The absence of fiery rhetoric or sweeping slogans from Judge Breyer's opinions
should not be confused with a lack of commitment to justice and fairness. To the
contrary, his calm reasoning and superior craftsmanship often achieve more effec-
tive victories for justice and fairness than might have been won by a display of pas-
sion alone.

  For example, through his judicious methods, Judge Breyer has often been able to
dissolve technical obstacles and give force to holdings that increase access to courts
or protect the rights of minorities--holdings that might not have been as persuasive
if set forth with less precision or care, See, e.g., Munoz-Mendoza v. Pierce, 711 F.
2d 421 (1st Cir 1984) (holding, contrary to the district court, that minority residents
of an integrated Boston neighborhood had standing to argue that a federal building
project would cause the racial segregation of their neighborhood); Mayburg v. Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, 740 F.2d 100 (1st Cir 1984) (holding, contrary
to an HHS interpretation, that an 88-year-old woman who lived in a nursing home
was eligible to keep receiving benefits without haying to move from the home); Stu-
art v. Roche, 951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir 1991) (upholding a decree designed to cure past
racial discrimination in the Boston Police Department, finding it narrowly tailored
under the Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson Co.).

  Finally, his opinions also exhibit considerable restraint. He declines to reach out
to embrace principles that are broader than necessary to decide the case before him.
See, e.g., Alexander v. Trustees of Boston University, 766 F.2d 630, 650 (1st Cir
1985) (Breyer, J., dissenting) ("I would not allow the parties, through their choice
                                      429

of arguments, to force this court unnecessarily to decide a broader constitutional
question than the facts require."). And if a record is inadequate, he does not hesitate
to send a case back for further facts.

  Taken together, these features of Judge Breyer's skilled judicial craftsmanship en-
able him to serve as a potential catalyst for consensus on the Court, even among
Justices of differing views.

  3. Judicious temperament. On this point, I can be brief: Judge Breyer is not only
an intellectually distinguished judge, but a fair and judicious one. He is open-mind-
ed and even-handed. He genuinely listens to others. He is willing to revise his views
when one persuades him that he was wrong. He is highly focused, and is undaunted
by factiousness or conflict. Thus, he has in abundance the qualities of spirit, as well
as the qualities of mind, to serve with the greatest distinction as an Associate Jus-
tice on the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Professor.
  I read with some interest the treatise of Professor Farber of the
University of Minnesota on pragmatism and the criticisms of the
new pragmatism--as nonlawyers have a clear sense, we lawyers
sometimes try to give phrases that have generic meanings very
specific meanings that sometimes are difficult to understand. There
are some very cogent criticisms of pragmatism.
  I have one question for you, Professor. You make it clear that
you think that Judge Breyer is a legal pragmatist in the tradition
of Holmes and Harlan. Apart from the work of these two Justices,
what makes you conclude that the Court's dominant tradition in
this century has been legal pragmatism?
  Ms. SULLIVAN. It is not just Justice Holmes, but also Justice
Cardozo, to a great extent Justice Brandeis, who launched us in
the modern constitutional tradition who were pragmatists, who
were influenced by that distinctively American philosophy that
says that the value of something is to be measured by its practical
effect. It is a distinctively American tradition rooted in the writings
of Dewey and Perse and James. But to connect it up with our own
time, I believe it is also the dominant judicial philosophy on our
Supreme Court today. It is a philosophy that enables
  The CHAIRMAN. That was my next question. I would like to know
why you conclude that.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Because I think if we look at the decisions of the
Court, the great decisions of the Court in the last few terms, we
see the Justices who come from very different places in life and
very different views of the world, very different political sides of
the aisle, can come together around basic propositions such as that
people should be unfettered in their right of access to basic con-
stitutional rights, such as the view that there is a balance to be
held between the interests of people in exercising their religion and
the interests of keeping the public order free from the establish-
ment of religion.
  In issues like privacy and speech and religion, the most contested
issues in our time, where it is so easy to be divided, where it is
so easy to be passionate, we have seen that pragmatism is what
enables Justices, as distinctive across a spectrum from Chief Jus-
tice Rehnquist to Justice Ginsburg to agree, to agree on what is the
best outcome in a particular case.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU think that is the spectrum? I kind of think
it goes Rehnquist, Ginsburg, to some other place. But
  Ms. SULLIVAN. There are some on the Court, of course, Mr.
Chairman, who do not share this philosophy. There are some who
                                               430

do not share this philosophy, but I think we have seen it in recent
terms to be dominant, and that is no surprise. That is no surprise
because the people on the Court today are bearers of the tradition
that traces back to Holmes.

  The CHAIRMAN. I happen to agree with you. That was one of the
reasons--and I know I expose you here, I consulted you on the
nominations of Justices Souter and Kennedy and others. I will end
with this, but I was just asked by a press person 10 minutes ago
on the way back from the vote where did I think Judge Breyer fit
of the six or seven nominees I have presided over, the eight or nine
that I have either been in the minority or majority, ranking mem-
ber or Chair. And something struck me, and I would like you to
comment on it. Notwithstanding that there have been some aberra-
tions, there is a similarity in approach, although reaching different
conclusions sometimes, from the Republican appointees of Kennedy
and Souter, for example, and the Clinton appointees of Ginsburg
and Breyer.

  I have no way to prove this, but it seems to me there is a
generational element that fits here in the following sense--and I
have facetiously said they are somewhere between "Ozzie and Har-
riet" and Roseanne Barr in terms of their life experiences, in what
they value and do not value, what they view as accepted and given
values of this society. I do not think we are going to see any fun-
damental difference among them on issues of race, on issues of
basic civil rights and civil liberties.

  Oh, there will be disagreements. You know, that old expression:
Hard cases make bad law, and lots of those hard cases get to the
Supreme Court, on the rights of defendants and determining how
far the right to privacy goes and does not go. But it seems as
though they reflect these values that are shared in common that
reflect this pragmatic approach you have referred to in their ap-
proach to constitutional methodology.

  Talk to me about that a little bit, about where you see these last
four nominees in fitting within your definition of pragmatism and
the tradition of Holmes and Harlan and others.

  Ms. SULLIVAN. I agree, Mr. Chairman, with your description. I
think that there is a lot of similarity of method and approach
among these recent nominees, and I think that is no surprise, and
I think it is generational, as you suggest.

  Justice Blackmun, whom Justice Breyer will replace, and Justice
Kennedy and Justice Souter at Harvard and Judge Breyer at Har-
vard, like Justice O'Connor and Chief Justice Rehnquist at Stan-
ford, received an education in this pragmatic tradition. The prag-
matic tradition was distilled in the 1950's and 1960's into what is
sometimes called the legal process school, dominated by Professors
Henry Hart and former dean of Harvard Law School Albert Sachs,
the late Albert Sachs.

  What they said is very much like what Judge Breyer has said to
you today. We have got to look at all the sources of information we
can, institutions, history, text, structure, tradition, precedent, in
order to inform our judgments. And we have got to be humble; we
have got to be modest; we have got to decide the case before us.
We have got to mistrust grand theories and sweeping propositions.
We mistrust the philosopher in his certainty that he has the right
                                      431

angle on all questions. We are more modest folks. We want to look
at the case before us and decide things case by case.

  So I think their training, both at Harvard and at Stanford, and
at the other schools from where the Justices comes, was very simi-
lar.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO that if anyone is dissatisfied with the Court,
they can blame in on Harvard and Stanford.

  Ms. SULLIVAN. That is right.
  Mr. CASPER. Senator Biden, may I add something?
  The CHAIRMAN. Please. I am finished.
  Mr. CASPER. YOU pointed to the basic consensus among the Jus-
tices and the candidates you have seen on redefining American val-
ues. And I think in the heat of debate over the last decade or so,
we sometimes forget how strong that consensus actually is. The
consensus is very strong in the country.
  It so happened that I was just reading last night a paper on eval-
uating public attitudes toward those values, and it is very gratify-
ing to see that the public across all ethnic groups continues to be
very much dedicated to these values. And so is the group of law-
yers that have been educated at our law schools, to a very large
extent. The gap is not as great as it sometimes seems to be made
out in the press.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to attach to the record--I do not
think we have to spend the money to put it in the record--"Legal
Pragmatism and the Constitution," by Daniel A. Farber,* of the
University of Minnesota Law School, which goes into great detail,
but essentially raises in great detail the criticisms of legal prag-
matism by others and the defenses. But I, quite frankly, gain some
solace from what I think has been a diminution of the ideological
warfare, if you will, that has gone on in the recent past on occa-
sion, with the exception of the Justices that I have named, al-
though I am absolutely convinced beyond any reasonable doubt
that under the advise and consent clause Senators have a right to
ask whatever they wish to ask and a right to resist an appointment
whenever they so deem appropriate.
  What is a right is not always wise to exercise. I have views that
have been informed by people like you, Kathleen, and others that
are somewhat different sometimes from some of the Justices that
are on the Court, and I am sure they will differ with Justice
Breyer. But this acceptance that seems to run through the four
Justices I have mentioned of the basic touchstones in the American
value system on the important issues is, I think, an important
point to make, and you have made it well. I thank you both.
  I yield the floor now to my friend from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I want to welcome both of you here again.
Ms. Sullivan, I welcome you to the committee again, and, President
Casper, we are glad to have you here and we appreciate your testi-
mony. And I agree that this is an excellent nominee. Do I agree
with him on everything? None of us does, and that is not the issue.
The issue is, I think, more than put to rest by his testimony and
helped by yours.

   ·See Farber, "Legal Pragmatism and the Constitution," 72 Minn. L. Rev. 1331 (1988). An ear-
lier version of part I of this article was presented as the inaugural lecture for the Fletcher Chair
on Nov. 6, 1987.

  Thank you.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you.
  Mr. CASPER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I want to join in welcoming
the panel, and a special welcome to Professor Sullivan. 1 think all
of us who have been on this committee have benefited from her
enormous insight on these constitutional issues and questions. You
have had an incredibly distinguished career up at Harvard Law
School, and I know all the members of this committee have valued
very much your insights, and the breadth of her sensitivity on so
many of these fundamental issues of constitutional rights and lib-
erties. We are delighted to have you here.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. The clock has gone on. I wanted to just
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Senator. They tell me we have 6 min-
utes before the vote.
  Senator KENNEDY. OK; just in one area, Professor Sullivan, one
area of constitutional law that is a specialty of yours is the right
of privacy, and the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy is
encompassed within that right. I would just like to ask you about
Judge Breyer's record in that area.
  In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. HHS, Judge Breyer joined
the first circuit in holding that the so-called gag rule barring coun-
seling with respect to abortion by federally funded family planning
programs violated what the Court called the right of reproductive
choice as well as the first amendment.
  Just based on this first circuit opinion and Judge Breyer's overall
record, are you confident that Justice Breyer sitting on the Su-
preme Court will do honor to Justice Blackmun's legacy in uphold-
ing the fundamental right to choose recognized in Roe y. Wade?
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Senator Kennedy, as Judge Breyer said before the
committee, he regards Roe v. Wade as settled law, as reaffirmed in
Casey two terms ago. But the case that you mention, Common-
wealth of Massachusetts v. Secretary of HHS, reinforces that view
because that was a case in which the first circuit, sitting en bane,
Judge Breyer voting with the court for this view, held that the so-
called gag rule that said those clinics that take Federal money can
counsel for pregnancy but they cannot counsel in favor of abortion,
what the first circuit did is they struck that down, and they said
that violates not only the first amendment rights of doctors to
speak and women to listen to truthful medical advice, but it also
violates their right of privacy by, in effect, burdening that right
with skewed information, a bum steer.
  Now, in a very close, it is a very difficult and controversial area
because it involves Federal funding, and the Supreme Court came
to the opposite conclusion in Rust v. Sullivan. But I think in that
very thoughtful and very well developed opinion for the first cir-
cuit, Judge Breyer joined in a view that the right of privacy is fun-
damental and that it must be protected against burdens.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Our time I think is up,
Mr. Chairman. I again want to thank the panel.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know you both have come a long way to testify,
and I say this with great sincerity. Please do not read from the fail-
ure of everyone to be here and ask you a lot of questions anything
                                               433

other than respect for your testimony and lack of disagreement
with what you have come here to suggest. So I thank you both
very, very much, and, Mr. President, I mean this sincerely, I wish
you well. You are at the helm of one of the great universities in
the world, and it is a hell of an honor, I am sure, but an incredible
obligation and difficult task. I wish you well. It is a great school.

  Mr. CASPER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I regret that
Senator Feinstein is not here any longer. I saw that she is even
dressed in Stanford's colors.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, she is.

  Mr. CASPER. I assume that was in honor of my appearance here
today. Please express my appreciation to her.

  The CHAIRMAN. I will. Let me ask staff, are there any Senators
who wish this panel to stay? I do not believe there was a request
from them.

  I thank you both very, very much.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me announce, before I go to vote, our next
panel is composed of three very distinguished people who wish to
testify in opposition to Judge Breyer. And as soon as I return, we
will empanel that panel and get on with the testimony.
  We will adjourn for a vote.
  [Recess.]
  Senator SPECTER. Professor, I want to speak with you about the
Court's responsibility to interpret the Constitution, and I have been
concerned about the Court's, in effect, reversal of decisions like
Griggs, which established the important doctrines of disparate im-
pact and business necessity, and to the Civil Rights Act, a very im-
portant civil rights concept, which interpreted the 1964 Civil
Rights Act in the 1971 unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice
Burger, and then was reversed in Ward's Cove, and then the Con-
gress took up the laborious, highly partisan task of amending the
Civil Rights Act, which we did by 1991, and the impact of Rust v.
Sullivan where the regulation that stood for some 18 years that
counselors using Federal family planning grants could advise on
the abortion option, until that was reversed by the new regulation,
which was upheld by a 5-to-4 decision with Chief Justice Rehnquist
saying that the attitude of the public having charged on abortion
accommodated or justified a change, and the issue of capital pun-
ishment where Justice Marshall, along with Justice Brennan, came
to the conclusion that capital punishment violated the eighth
amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
  This is a quotation from Justice Marshall's concurring opinion in
Furman, which I discussed with Judge Breyer, where Justice Mar-
shall said, cited with approval the quotation, "Time works changes
and brings into existence new conditions and purposes. In the ap-
plication of the Constitution, our contemplation cannot be only of
what has been but of what may be."
  Now, I am very concerned about a standard of that sort which
appears to me to really give the Supreme Court a policymaking
function, really a legislative function. And you search the history
of our country, and the most prominent example you come to of a
public need for that would be Brown v. Board of Education, where
you had, intolerable in this country, segregation which had gone on
                                               434

uncorrected by the Congress or by the State legislatures or by the
executive branch. And finally the Court acted. And the Court acted
in what was unquestionably the interest of justice in America,
equal justice, and the Court acted because nobody else had acted.
The Congress, the State legislatures, the executive branch, the
Governors, nobody else acted.

  That necessity has been applauded, and I join in that applause,
the moral conscience of the country. But what we really had were
these Platonic Solons deciding what was good for the country in a
change of constitutional doctrine.

  My question for you, Professor, is: With this standard, that in the
application of the Constitution, our contemplation, the Court's con-
templation cannot be only of what has been but what may be,
where is any line, bright or dim, separating the Court's role from
the legislative function?

  Ms. SULLIVAN. Well, it is an excellent question, Senator. It is the
deep question of constitutional law that you ask. But let me stress
that we must be clear in distinguishing pragmatism on the one
hand from personal opinion or popular opinion on the other.

  Pragmatism is not an effort to enact you own preferences into
law, and it is not an effort to be a bellwether of popular opinion.
Pragmatism does not follow the polls.

  What a pragmatic judge tries to do instead is to look outside
himself and to sources more lasting and deeper and enduring than
the passions of the moment. And what the Court did in Brown is
a fine example. It was certainly not a response to popular opinion,
which, of course, was, if anything, the other way in 1954. Brown
was an effort to look at the meaning of the guarantee of equal pro-
tection in a time that had changed. There were very few public
schools, virtually no public schools at the time the 14th amendment
was enacted. Those that existed were segregated in some parts of
the country, and yet what the Court said is we are not going to
look to that narrow history at the time of the framing of the 14th
amendment. We are going to look to this guarantee in terms of its
purpose, in terms of its human purpose in guaranteeing the equal-
ity of the races before the law.

  The law cannot just mean the courtroom, said the Court. The law
cannot just mean certain civic institutions. It has to mean the
schools as well.

  Now, where did they look? They looked to the text of the clause.
They looked to the history of the clause, not its narrow history but
the history of its broader purposes. They looked to the change in
social circumstance over time, the rising importance of public
schools as a fountain of people's dignity and civic education. And
they said, reading this clause in terms of its present meaning but
according to its original purposes, there must no longer be segrega-
tion of the schools.

  It is the same sort of thing that the Court did when it upheld
the New Deal, in the cases, the great cases of 1936 and 1937 that
said that to read the doctrine of laissez faire into the Constitution
was in error. It was an error in terms of the circumstances of our
time: soup kitchens, 25 percent unemployment, the need for Gov-
ernment to regulate if the very human purposes of a free economic
were to be realized.
                                               435

  So I think it is a very important distinction to make, but it is
critical, between pragmatism, which is a look outside the judge's
self to history, tradition, the conscience of a free people, precedent,
social facts outside himself--we must distinguish that effort, which
is an effort to look to objective sources of meaning from any at-
tempt to enact one's subjective preferences into law. And I think
Judge Breyer was clear to the committee in numerous colloquies
that when strong personal preferences are held that conflict with
all that information, all that data from outside about what the law
means, one is not to enact one's person preferences into law; one
is to, if the personal feeling is too strong, remove oneself from the
case.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Professor Sullivan, that sounds good and
makes sense to a substantial extent, but it is the judge who looks
outside, starting from looking inside. And none of us can divorce
ourselves from our own views, and it has to be significantly if not
largely a personal decision as to what those outside forces are.

  Now, wasn't it a matter in the first instance, really, for the legis-
lature of Alabama, Georgia, or the Congress of the United States,
or the President? President Truman had an executive order for
nondiscrimination in the armed services. Wasn't it first a matter
of public policy that should have been decided by the legislatures,
by the Congress, or by the President?

  Ms. SULLIVAN. There are times when the political bodies do not
and sometimes times when the political bodies cannot act given
the

  Senator SPECTER. What do you mean cannot act?
  Ms. SULLIVAN. When their political
  Senator SPECTER. It is against their political interest to act?
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Well, in the case of civil rights legislative efforts
in the 1950's, that might well be the case. But I think that it would
be a mistake, though, to say that what the Court did in Brown was
to legislate what Congress could not. I do not think that would be
a description of what the Court did. The Court interpreted the
equal protection clause. The Court interpreted the document, the
Constitution, the binding text.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you think the Congress should have legis-
lated long before Brown v. Board of Education in 1954?
  Ms. SULLIVAN. There might be an argument that that is so.
There might be an argument that is so.
  I think our history and the case of racial segregation is a tragic
and embarrassing one and one that should have been rectified
sooner. But when political bodies cannot act, sometimes courts
must.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that you articulate it accurately.
I agree with what you say when political bodies do not act. I do
not believe that political bodies cannot act. I believe that political
bodies do not act because it is against their personal interest, sig-
nificantly of the legislators, and it reflects their constituents' point
of view. But they do not act. And I think the Supreme Court had
to act in Brown, and that is the seminal case for the Court to act.
And it can be articulated in very fine concepts deeply rooted in the
tradition of the people, as the Court recognized in Palco. You have
in the criminal field the decision in Miranda v. Arizona, where the
                                               436

Court decided that the Constitution required five specific warnings
and five specific waivers. And that was a field where the legislative
bodies could have acted for decades, and on June 13, 1966, the Su-
preme Court of the United States came down and said the Con-
stitution requires that every police officer give five warnings. You
have the right to remain silent; you have a right to counsel; if you
do not have counsel, it will be provided for you; if you start to talk,
you can stop talking. And then a week later the Supreme Court
came down with the decision saying that that decision took effect
on June 13 for any trial that started after that date.

  I was a district attorney at that time and had cases where crimi-
nals had confessed, corroborating evidence, found the gun, found
the loot, in May 1966. You could not start the trial before June 13.
Who knew? And the Supreme Court of the United States came
down with that decision.

  Now, what is there in our traditions that warrants that kind of
an abrupt change which is retroactive in its application? How do
you accord, under our theory of constitutional government, that
much power in the Court, except what the judges themselves make
a personal determination? And they can say they look outward, but
it is hard to find any external objective determinants which war-
rant that kind of a conclusion or which give them that kind of
power.

  Ms. SULLIVAN. Well, Senator Specter, I think the important hold-
ing of Miranda was not the specific words of the five warnings that
everyone who watches prime-time television is so familiar with
today. The important holding in the Miranda decision was that co-
ercion of a person to bear witness against himself can come as well
from psychological methods as from the end of a rubber hose.

  What the Court was saying is that our fundamental, deep-seated,
18th century view that no one shall be compelled, coerced, made
against his will to speak against himself to confess, that was the
core of Miranda. What Miranda was saying is that there is a lot
more coercion in a station house than happens simply through
physical beatings. Coercion can come in other forms.

  That is the kind of decision the Court has to make in many
areas. The Court has made the decision that sometimes school chil-
dren are coerced into school prayer when they are made to say it
along with their fellows, or a State can be coerced into following
the will of Congress through being told things in a Federal law.
Sometimes the Court has to expand its modern notion of what is
a very ancient fundamental concept that certain things should not
be coerced out of people or out of States.

  I think that is the core. We should not focus so much on the spe-
cific warnings or on the specific timing. It is always hard when a
new rule comes into effect, and I understand very much what you
are saying about being caught in that transition period. But the
core of Miranda was doing exactly what I think pragmatic judges
do, which is you look outside--you take our tradition. You take the
fifth amendment guarantee against compelled self-incrimination,
and you interpret it in light of modern times, in light of late 20th
century understandings that sometimes police methods other than
brute force can violate our rights. And I think that the Court in
that case did look to other sources, to studies by the States, to
                                               437

changes in State law, to studies by the ALI and other bodies, to
try to come up with the method. And we can all--reasonable men
and women can disagree about the precise warnings, but about the
concept of compelled self-incrimination, that is what the Court was
really just trying to bring anew into a modern age.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I thank you for your comments. The
chairman has returned, and we have a great many witnesses, so
I am not going to prolong any further Q and A. We had a little lull
in the action. I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss these is-
sues with you.

  I would say in conclusion that the principles of coercion had long
been articulated by the Court, and we had the Escobedo case 2
years before which had two warnings. And we had Turner v. Penn-
sylvania on coerced confessions. We have a large body of law, and
I would have to disagree with you that it was not too important
what the specific warnings were, because a lot of murderers, where
there was conclusive evidence, far beyond the confession, corrobora-
tion, that went to the residence of the defendant, found the gun,
found the proceeds from the taxi robbery. So that when the Court
comes down with these specific warnings and the policemen in May
1966 could not conceivably, obviously, have anticipated what the
warnings would have to be, and you have the Court coming down
with that decision, and not only the decision but it is not prospec-
tive from that day forward, it is retroactive. And you take a look
at what the Court has done, and we have a wonderful system of
government beyond any question with our Constitution. And the
advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. But I think we have
to stop and take a look at what the Court does when they articu-
late the meaning of the Constitution relying on a standard of exter-
nal factors, pragmatism, something which is not their personal
view that comes from the outside, it is hard to find that outside.

  I think we do not have enough focus in hearings of this sort or
in the Court itself on the respective role of the legislative branch
versus the judicial branch. And you can applaud the Court loudly
for Brown v. Board of Education, but you look at a lot of their
other decisions, and you wonder where they think they get the au-
thority to do that.

   Ms. SULLIVAN. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. This is a subject I think we have to pursue
when the only chance we have is when they come here in this brief
nominating process or when there is a break in the action and we
can talk to a professor of law.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Professor. I only regret because of
your transfer from Harvard to Stanford, that it takes you longer to
get here. But I am not sure--and I am not being facetious when
I say this--that you could continue the tutorial for Senator Specter.
I have found, Senator, that what I have attempted to do, maybe be-
cause I have needed it more than you, is to assemble professors of
the caliber of Professor Sullivan who have been kind enough over
the last 10 years to literally come to my office and spend hours,
sometimes days pursuing a particular constitutional point with me,
to educate me, unrelated to the hearings. I would highly rec-
ommend it, and I would highly recommend Professor Sullivan.
                                               438

  Thanks, Kathleen.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Senator Biden.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW did Gerhard escape and you get caught?
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would just like to
welcome Professor Sullivan and Dr. Casper, as well. They hail from
my alma mater in my State, and I am a big fan of yours. I have
heard you many times. I never had occasion to see you in person,
and it was most interesting for me to listen to your comments.
  If I may, I would just like to make one comment in response, be-
cause, surprisingly enough, I agree with much of what Senator
Specter just said about the law and the streets very often, not un-
derstanding each other, and dropped in between in a huge chasm
is protection of the public, and somewhere between the two we
have got to find the balance.
  But I just want to say I am delighted to welcome you here, and
it was a great treat for me to listen to you.
  Ms. SULLIVAN. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the privilege of appearing before
you today and working with the committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  I want the record to note, Senator Feinstein, that President Cas-
per pointed out on the record that he appreciated you wearing
Stanford colors today.
  Our next distinguished panel is a panel composed of three indi-
viduals representing groups wishing to testify in opposition. First,
we have Paige Comstock Cunningham. Ms. Cunningham is presi-
dent of Americans United for Life in Chicago. Also on this panel
is Michael Farris. Mr. Farris is president and founder of the Home
School Legal Defense Association and is here on its behalf today.
The Home School Legal Defense Association, together with the Na-
tional Center for Home Education, is a nationwide group in support
of home schooling.
  I said three. It is panel three, with two people. I apologize. I wel-
come you both. We welcome you both. Ms. Cunningham, would you
begin, please?

PANEL CONSISTING OF PAIGE COMSTOCK CUNNINGHAM,
  PRESIDENT, AMERICANS UNITED FOR LIFE, CHICAGO, IL;
  AND MICHAEL P. FARRIS, PRESIDENT, HOME SCHOOL
  LEGAL DEFENSE ASSOCIATION, PURCELLVILLE, VA

        STATEMENT OF PAIGE COMSTOCK CUNNINGHAM
  Ms. CUNNINGHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of
the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you
again today, as I was here just a year ago in another confirmation
hearing.
  My name is Paige Cunningham. I am an attorney and also presi-
dent of Americans United for Life, which is the oldest national
legal organization in this country representing the pro-life move-
ment. We are the only national legal organization devoted exclu-
sively to writing, passing and defending laws, laws of a particular
nature, those that shield mothers and their innocent children from
abortion. But AUL also works to change the law, to protect the
                                      439

sick, the elderly and the disabled from euthanasia and assisted sui-
cide.

  We are here today perhaps to introduce a somewhat discordant
note in these harmonious and cordial proceedings for one reason,
and that reason is because we are haunted by the image, the image
of millions of women and children who have been injured or de-
stroyed by abortion.

  We have fought for them in the courts for 21 years, and it may
be another 20 years before we succeed, just as it was for abolition,
for women's suffrage, and for the civil rights movements. But one
thing is clear: We will never give up.

  Judge Breyer may have ample professional and legal credentials
to sit on the Supreme Court, but we are concerned about one flaw
that is fatal, and that flaw is the process by which he was selected
and its impact on the courts, on the law, and on the real people
of this Nation.

  President Clinton has made it clear that he would appoint to the
Supreme Court only a supporter of Roe v. Wade. A nominee for the
Supreme Court must now pass a test, a pro-abortion test. No other
administration has pushed its political agenda as feverishly as the
current one. Judge Breyer's nomination to the Supreme Court
clearly implies that he has passed this political test. It should be
obvious that an abortion litmus test is an insult to the integrity of
the highest court in this land. But what is far more disturbing is
the abortion doctrine itself that Judge Breyer will be expected to
support.

  In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that a mother
may end the life of a child in her womb for any reason and at any
time. The Court's decision in Roe openly defied a social, moral and
legal tradition condemning abortion that dates back at least 800
years. Roe has been condemned as unprincipled, both by members
of the Court and by constitutional scholars, including those who
favor a pro-abortion public policy.

  Unlike Brown v. Board of Education, the once controversial
school desegregation case which is now universally accepted, Roe v.
Wade has never been settled in our society. In fact, by overriding
the democratic process, the Court created the very division it now
claims to have healed. That division illustrates what Judge Breyer
warned of earlier this week, that judges can become isolated in the
court room from the real people in the streets. What he said is
true, that the decisions he has made, the decisions that he will
help to make on the Supreme Court will have an effect upon the
lives of many, many Americans.

  Well, AUL is confronted daily with many, many American
women which the abortion law of this land has touched. They are
career women, teenagers, students, mothers, rich and poor. And as
we work with and represent them, AUL is increasingly convinced
that women would be better off without this abortion policy.

  Roe has done nothing to advance women's legal, social or eco-
nomic rights. The real progress in these areas has come, as you
well know, through Congress and State legislatures. They have
passed dozens of laws mandating equal pay for equal work and
banning sex discrimination in public and private employment, in
the sale and rental of housing, in education and many other areas.
                                             440

Not one of these laws depends upon Roe or upon a right to abor-
tion.

  When the law places a mother's rights above those of her very
own child, what happens? She is the one who is left with the sole
responsibility for any child she chooses to bear. We see it most
clearly in the workplace. You can't imagine how many women are
told in very subtle ways, because you will not find it in an em-
ployee handbook, that if you want to make partner here, don't start
a family, if you want to stay on the police force, don't get pregnant.

  If abortion were not so readily available and promoted, there
would be healthy pressure on employers to accommodate women
who have children and want or need to continue working. Instead,
employers and men get off the hook, because they can say that if
a woman has the right to choose abortion, she chooses not to exer-
cise this right, then she is on her own.

  The costs to women's bodies and lives cannot even begin to be
measured here today. Many women are abandoned by the baby's
father as soon as the crisis pregnancy and the abortion are over.
More than 70 percent of relationships fall about after the abortion.
Thousands of women now bear the scars of a perforated uterus or
the loss of fertility, and many still continue to die from abortions.
We can't even give you these figures, because the abortion industry
is the most unregulated industry in this country. Accurate data is
simply not available.

  Judge Breyer has said that the law must work for people. But
our 21-year-old abortion law has worked against women. The trag-
edy of abortion is a gaping national wound, a wound whose ugli-
ness is covered up by polite tolerance and rhetoric about a woman's
right to choose and keeping government out of private decisions.

  But the devastation of Roe is not limited to those millions of chil-
dren who will never be born or to the mothers and families who
will never cuddle their babies and hear them laugh or pick them
up when they cry, because Roe has seeped into other areas of our
law with an abortion distortion lens that clouds our laws and Con-
stitution. We should pay attention to the warning signs.

  Just 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court jeopardized the first
amendment for so-called abortion rights. It upheld certain restric-
tions on peaceful nonviolent protests at abortion clinics. I wonder
if these protests would have been protected, if anything other than
abortion or opposition to abortion had been the issue.

  And in May of this year, a Federal district court in the State of
Washington made an unprecedented decision to strike down a 140-
year-old law that prevented assisted suicide. And how did she do
so? She based her opinion on Roe's stepchild, Planned Parenthood
v. Casey.

  Unless this committee was presented with convincing evidence to
the contrary, we must assume that Judge Breyer has passed Presi-
dent Clinton's abortion litmus test. But the Senate is not obliged
to rubber stamp this nomination. It is time to stop and seriously
question the support for an abortion law that is ripping away at
our constitutional freedoms, the right to life and liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, and now the freedom of speech.

  Judge Breyer said before you that he thinks it is absolutely intol-
erable that one real child is killed every hour through violence.
                                      441

Now, you may not have seen the assault on them, you could not
have heard their cries. But in the short time I have spoken to you,
over 15 children have felt the violent pain of abortion.

  Because we believe this onslaught must end, we must respect-
fully and regretfully oppose this nomination.

  Thank you.
  [The prepared statement of Ms. Cunningham follows:]

                     PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAIGE COMSTOCK CUNNINGHAM

  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for this oppor-
tunity to testify concerning the nomination of Judge Stephen Breyer to the United
States Supreme Court.

  My name is Paige Cunningham. I am an attorney and the president of Americans
United for Life, the legal arm of the pro-life movement. Americans United for Life
(AUL) is the only national legal organization dedicated exclusively to writing, pass-
ing and defending laws--laws that shield innocent children and their mothers from
abortion. AUL also works to change law and public policy to protect the sick, the
elderly, and the disabled from euthanasia and assisted suicide.

  We are here today because we are haunted by the image of millions of women
and their children who have been injured and destroyed by abortion. We have
fought on their behalf in the courts for twenty-one years, and it may be another
twenty years--just as it was for the abolition, women's suffrage, and the civil rights
movements--before we succeed. But one thing is clear. We will not give up the fight
for women and their little ones in the judicial arena.

  Although Judge Breyer clearly has the credentials to sit on the Supreme Court,
we are concerned about one flaw which we believe to be fatal. That flaw is the proc-
ess by which he was selected and its impact on the courts, the law, and American
society.

  President Clinton made it clear that he would appoint to the Supreme Court only
a supporter of Roe v. Wade1. A nominee for the Supreme Court must now pass a
test--an abortion litmus test, a test which other presidents were wrongfully accused
of applying. His position as a nominee implies that Judge Breyer has passed this
test. Members of this Committee and other Senators warned several years ago that
we should not require a judicial nominee to commit himself to a particular position
on an issue that may come before him as a judge. As Abraham Lincoln said, "[W]e
cannot ask a nominee how he would vote, and if he told us, we would despise him."

  It should be obvious that an abortion litmus test is an insult to the integrity of
the Highest Court in the land. But what is far more disturbing is the abortion doc-
trine that Judge Breyer will be expected to support. In 1973, the Supreme Court
ruled in Roe v. Wade that a mother may end the life of the child in her womb for
any reason, throughout all nine months of her pregnancy. And it did so with no con-
stitutional basis. The Court's decision in Roe openly defied a social and legal tradi-
tion condemning abortion that dates back at least to the beginnings of the common
law in England, almost eight hundred years ago.

  Roe has been condemned as unprincipled both by Members of the Court and by
constitutional scholars, including those who favor abortion as a matter of legislative
policy. Unlike Brown v. Board of Education,2 the once-controversial school desegre-
gation case which is now universally accepted, Roe v. Wade has never been settled
in our society. In fact, by overriding the democratic process, the Court created the
very division it now claims to have healed.

  Women would be better off without this abortion policy. Roe has done nothing to
advance women's legal, social or economic rights. The real progress has come
through Congress and state legislatures. They have passed dozens of laws mandat-
ing equal pay for equal work and banning sex discrimination in public and private
employment, sale and rental of housing, education and other areas. Not one of these
laws depends on Roe or on a right to abortion.

  Even more troubling is the Court's current belief that abortion is necessary for
women's equality. This is profoundly anti-woman. The Court seemed to suggest two
years ago in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey3 that we
women can be made "equal" to men only if we are given the right to destroy our
own children through abortion. But it is offensive and sexist to imply that we must

   1410 U.S. 113(1973).
   2 347 U.S. 483(1954).
   3 112 S. Ct. 2791(1992).
                                             442

deny what makes us unique as women (our ability to conceive and bear children)
in order to be treated "equally" by men. True equality between the sexes will be
reached on the day when we can affirm what makes us unique as women and still
be treated fairly by the law and society.

  As our feminist pioneers agreed, abortion goes against core values of womanhood:
equality, care, nurturing, compassion, inclusion, and non-violence.

  Roe was supposed to answer the causing concerns of a woman in a troubled preg-
nancy. But what has been the legacy of Roe? Has a generation of abortion on de-
mand solved any of the problems for which it was offered? Has abortion reduced
the rates of child abuse? Or absentee fathers? Or teen pregnancy? Or spousal abuse?
Or has the violence of abortion, both to our unborn children and to ourselves, desen-
sitized us to violence?

  Has the availability of abortion reduced the numbers of women in poverty? Or has
it actually aggravated the feminization of poverty? Has abortion enhanced respect
for women? Or has it encouraged casual sexual relationships and male irresponsibil-
ity?

  After more than twenty years of abortion on demand, abortion has flunked the
test as the miracle cure for the social problems abortion advocates promised it would
solve. The destruction and tragedy caused by more than thirty million abortions--
nearly 30,000 every week, or half the population city of Chicago every year--per-
formed at all stages of pregnancy, is a gaping national wound, a wound whose ugli-
ness is covered up by polite tolerance and rhetoric about "a woman's right to choose"
and "keeping government out of private choices."

  The devastation of Roe is not limited to those millions of children who will never
be born, or to the mothers and families who will never cuddle their babies and hear
them laugh or comfort them when they cry. Roe has seeped into other areas of law,
with an "abortion distortion" lens that clouds our laws and Constitution. We should
pay attention to the warning signs.

  Just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court sacrificed the First Amendment to so-
called abortion rights. It upheld restrictions on peaceful, nonviolent, and otherwise
lawful protests at abortion clinics that in all likelihood would have been struck
down if anything other than abortion had been the subject of the protests.4 What
have we come to as a nation and society when abortion centers must be protected
by speech-free "muzzle zones," when the truth about abortion must be relegated to
the outfield of the public square?

  And in May of this year, a Federal district court in the State of Washington made
an unprecedented decision to strike down a 140-year-old law to protect assisted sui-
cide.5 The judge squarely based her opinion on Roe's step-child, Planned Parenthood
v. Casey.

  Unless this Committee is presented with convincing evidence to the contrary, we
must assume that Judge Breyer has passed President Clinton's "abortion-litmus
test." But the Senate is not obliged to rubber-stamp this nomination. In light of the
unprincipled nature of the decision in Roe and the enormous damage to millions of
men, women, and children, we must oppose a nominee who supports the abortion
regime that the Supreme Court has imposed on the American people, against their
wishes and profound beliefs. As a result, we must oppose the nomination of Stephen
Breyer to become Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

  Thank you.

  Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Thank you very much, Ms.
Cunningham.

  Mr. Farris, we are happy to hear from you, sir.

                      STATEMENT OF MICHAEL P. FARRIS

  Mr. FARRIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee.

  My name is Michael Farris, and I am the president of the Home
School Legal Defense Association and our affiliated group, the Na-
tional Center for Home Education. We have over 40,000 members
in all 50 States and every U.S. territory. We network with approxi-
mately 150 State and regional home school organizations, which in
turn network with 3,000 to 4,000 local home school support groups.

  4Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 62 U.S.L.W. 4686 (U.S. June 30, 1994).

                                               443

There are approximately 400,000 families home schooling approxi-
mately 1 million children in this country. It is the fastest growing
educational movement in our Nation.

  By way of personal background, I am a constitutional litigator
with an emphasis in free exercise litigation. I last testified before
this committee as the cochairman of the drafting committee for the
coalition supporting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

  Home School Legal Defense Association opposes the nomination
of Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court of the United States, be-
cause his views on the subject of the free exercise of religion, espe-
cially within the context of education, are so far beyond the pale
of acceptability, that we believe his presence on the Supreme Court
would represent a clear and present danger to our freedoms.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Farris, I don't want to interrupt you,
but I would just like you to clarify. I am not quite clear what the
home school concept is. Do you believe that all children should be
educated in the home and not in the public school system? Is that
the thrust of your organization?

  Mr. FARRIS. NO, Senator, it is not. The thrust is that we want
to defend the right of parents who choose to do that to legally do
so without unreasonable fetters. We want home schooling to be a
legal alternative in this country. When we started the organization,
only three States allowed home schooling as a matter of statutory
right. Now it is legal in all 50 States, although there are undue re-
strictions placed by various school districts and various laws. It is
a matter of legal freedom, not a matter of saying everyone should
choose this method.

  Senator METZENBAUM. And the parents can opt for that alter-
native to teach their children at home, and not send them to public
school or private school?

  Mr. FARRIS. We would oppose any coercion of any parent to
choose any form of education, whether it is public, private or home.
We simply think that this choice should be made available.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you for that clarification. Thank
you.

  Mr. FARRIS. YOU are welcome.
  We base our opposition of Judge Breyer on his exhaustive--there
is no question about Judge Breyer's scholarship. He is a very schol-
arly judge and writes very clear and articulate opinions, but that
does not make them right.
  His decision in New Life Baptist Academy v. East Longmeadow
School District, decided in 1989, is the focus of our opposition. I
wrote an amicus brief in that case submitted to Judge Breyer and
his fellow panel members in that case. He did reverse an excellent
opinion by the Federal district court. And later, when the private
school was unable to continue the case with private counsel, our or-
ganization undertook their case at that point and I became lead
counsel and personally wrote the cert petition to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which was denied during the same period of time within a
few weeks of their issuance of the decision of Employment Division
v. Smith, which was overturned, in effect, by the Senate's passage
of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
  We believe and are greatly concerned with the fact that Judge
Breyer's legal philosophy is in full accord with the majority opinion
                                             444

in Smith, and we believe totally out of sync with the philosophy of
this committee and Congress as a whole, which was endorsed by
passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

  We bring to this committee's attention four brief specific prob-
lems of Judge Breyer's opinion in New Life. First, he endorses the
notion that private schools can be regulated by subjective, unwrit-
ten, discretionary opinions of public school officials.

  Under Massachusetts law, private schools, including home
schools, must be "approved" by local school officials. Many school
districts in Massachusetts have adopted written policies which
specify objective criteria which they will evaluate for an approval.
But some districts, like the one involved in this case, merely say
they want to review the curriculum, teacher qualifications, lessons,
and enter the private school and make a wholly discretionary deci-
sion.

  The Federal district court in this case held that the system of
subjective discretion violated the free exercise and establishment
clause rights of this private religious school. A system of unwritten,
subjective, prior restraints I believe is simply unacceptable to a na-
tion with a historical commitment to the freedom of conscience and
expression.

  Judge Breyer rejected the private school's offer of an objective
means of analysis. The school had offered to voluntarily submit to
achievement tests, and Breyer rejected this offer as untrustworthy.

  I see that my time is up. The written testimony has been submit-
ted and I ask you to read it. But if I could just summarize in this
way:

  Judge Breyer's views are in lock-step opinion and sympathy with
the majority opinion in Smith. He gives very low opinion and value
to the free exercise of religion. Although he claims to be enforcing
the compelling State interest test, if you read his opinion closely,
he really says all the State has to do is enact reasonable laws.
Mere reasonableness is not enough to override the free exercise of
religion. There must be a compelling governmental interest for the
particular regulation at stake, and that particular regulation can-
not have any less restrictive alternatives.

  Judge Breyer substituted his own judgment for the judgment of
that religious school as to what was acceptable to their religions
views and what would burden their religion. And the substitution
of a judge for his determination of someone else's religion is such
a departure from an appropriate judicial methodology of evaluating
religious freedom, we view it very dangerous. He gratuitously said
that home schooling can be constitutionally banned entirely by a
State. We think that was not a necessary decision and very dan-
gerous to have someone on the Supreme Court who thinks that
that form of education can be constitutionally banned outright.

  [The prepared statement and a letter of Mr. Farris follow:]

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL P. FARRIS

  Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Committee:
  My name is Michael Farris. I am the president of the Home School Legal Defense
Association (HSLDA) and our affiliated group, the National Center for Home Edu-
cation. HSLDA has over 40,000 member families. We have members in all fifty
states and every U.S. territory.
                                         445

  Through the National Center for Home Education we network with approximately
150 state and regional organizations, which in turn network with three to four thou-
sand local home school support groups.

  There are approximately 400,000 families home schooling approximately 1 million
children in this country.

  By way of personal background, I am a constitutional lawyer with an emphasis
in free exercise litigation. I last testified before this Committee as the co-chairman
of the drafting committee for the coalition supporting the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act.

  Home School Legal Defense Association opposes the nomination of Stephen Breyer
to the Supreme Court of the United States because his views on the subject of the
free exercise of religion--especially within the context of education--are so far be-
yond the pale of acceptability that his presence on the Supreme Court would rep-
resent a clear and present danger to our freedoms.

  We base our assessment of Judge Breyer on his exhaustive, articulate, and, in our
view, dangerous opinion in New Life Baptist Academy v. East Longmeadow School
District, 885 F.2d 940 (1st Cir. 1989).

  On behalf of the private school, I wrote an amicus brief which was submitted to
Judge Breyer and his fellow panel members in that case. After Judge Breyer re-
versed an excellent opinion by the federal district court, the private school was un-
able to afford to have private counsel petition the Supreme Court for a Writ of Cer-
tiorari. Our organization undertook their case at that point, and I became lead coun-
sel and personally wrote the cert petition to the Supreme Court.

  The Supreme Court denied the petition during the same period of time it was de-
ciding the discredited opinion in Employment Division, Department of Human Re-
sources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). This Commission helped effectively
overturn Smith by the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. We believe
and are greatly concerned that Judge Breyer's legal philosophy is in full accord with
the majority opinion in Smith and totally out of sync with the philosophy this Com-
mittee and Congress as a whole endorsed by passing the Religious Freedom Restora-
tion Act.

  We bring to this Committee's attention four specific problems with Judge Breyer's
opinion in New Life:

  First, Judge Breyer endorses the notion that private schools can be regulated by
the subjective, unwritten, discretionary opinions of public school officials.

  Under Massachusetts law, private schools, including home schools, must be "ap-
proved" by local public school officials. Many school districts have adopted written
policies which specify objective criteria by which they will evaluate a request for ap-
proval. Some districts, like the one involved in this case, merely say they want to
review the curriculum, teacher qualifications, lessons, and enter the private (often
religious) schools to make a wholly discretionary decision.

  The federal district court held that this system of subjective discretion violated
the free exercise rights of this private religious school. A system of unwritten, sub-
jective, prior restraints is simply unacceptable to a nation with an historical com-
mitment to freedom of conscience and expression.

  Judge Breyer rejected the private school's offer of an objective means of analysis.
The private school officials voluntarily offered to submit achievement test results to
the public officials. Breyer viewed this offer as untrustworthy. He found it to insuffi-
ciently regulate the conduct of those who ran the school.

  We have a ha*"d time understanding why people can be trusted to choose their
leaders by voting for school board members and United States Senators, yet are
deemed unfit and untrustworthy to make unregulated choices regarding the edu-
cation of their own children. Breyer's mistrust of parents and church officials while
endorsing the use of government power over their First Amendment choices is an
anathema to those who believe in the competence of Americans and those who love
freedom.

  It is impossible to reconcile Judge Breyer's distrust of the parents and church
leaders in New Life and the following strong endorsement of the rights of parents
by former Chief Justice Burger written in a majority opinion for the Court:

  "That some parents 'may at times be acting against the interests of their children'
* * * creates a basis for caution, but it is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those
pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's
best interest * * * The statist notion that governmental power should supersede pa-
rental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is re-
pugnant to American tradition."

  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602-603 (1979).
  Moreover, Judge Breyer views regarding the right of government officials to rule
by their "mere discretion" directly violate longstanding precedents of the United

States Supreme Court. In Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939), the Supreme Court
ruled that it is unconstitutional to subject the exercise of a First Amendment free-
dom to the discretionary opinions of government officials. Judge Breyer's views rep-
resent a slap in the face to this line of Supreme Court precedent. Judge Breyer em-
braces government power too readily and spurns legitimate, longstanding protec-
tions of constitutional freedoms too easily.

  Second, Judge Breyer's New Life opinion cites with approval three decisions which
he says, "uphold [an] effective total ban on home schooling." Consider an analogy
from Employment Division v. Smith. Justice Scalia's opinion in Smith was subjected
to much criticism because it cited with approval Minersville School District v.
Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586 (1940). Gobitis, of course, is the case where the Supreme Court
said it was constitutional to expel Jehovah's Witnesses from the public schools for
refusing to salute the flag. By citing Gobitis, Justice Scalia clearly indicated that
his willingness to restrict religious freedom carried a long way indeed.

  Judge Breyer's citation of these anti-home school cases raises a similar concern.
We believe his opinion clearly indicates he would vote to uphold a state law which
bans home education. Four hundred thousand families in this country deserve a bet-
ter choice for the Supreme Court. It is simply unacceptable to American home
schoolers to have a person on the Court of last resort for their freedoms who be-
lieves they have no constitutionally protected right to educate their children.

  Judge Breyer is no moderate; but possesses the most extreme views concerning
the rights of those who lovingly teach their children at home.

  Third, Judge Breyer believes that Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), does
not state a general principle of parental religious liberty. His New Life opinion clear-
ly indicates that he sides with the school of thought that Yoder grants religious free-
dom only to Amish parents. This view raises two concerns.

  The lesser concern is this: Should someone be elevated to the Supreme Court who
so clearly misunderstands the very nature of a Supreme Court decision? The Su-

f»reme Court simply does not hear cases which do not involve general principles of

 aw. If the Yoder decision was to be limited to its facts, it would have never been
accepted for review by the high Court.

  The greater concern arises from Breyer's aberrant views on religious freedom. Ei-
ther religious freedom is protected for every faith in America or it is protected for
none. The reason the Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed was that virtually
every faith group endorsed it as stating a broad principle that every group is enti-
tled to religious freedom in America.

  We believe that a person is disqualified to serve on the Supreme Court if he has
ever endorsed the notion that a particular constitutional protection applies to one
faith group, but not to others. Breyer refused to apply Yoder to a Baptist church
in Massachusetts. We believe that the Supreme Court should be reserved for those
who believe that all parents of all faiths have the rights enunciated in Yoder.

  Fourth, Judge Breyer endorses the duplicitous notion religious school offer "reli-
gious education" when one is talking about government funding, but, when the issue
is government regulation, he then believes these same schools offer "secular edu-
cation." We believe that schools which are too religious to receive direct funding
under the Establishment Clause are too religious to be regulated by the government
under the Free Exercise Clause. The Constitution should not be interpreted as a ju-
dicial Catch-22.

  While these are our specific concerns relating to religious freedom and private
education, we believe there are broader concerns which should trouble all Ameri-
cans.

  Judge Breyer has endorsed the idea that one fundamental freedom can be sub-
jected to a prior restraint-styled approval process which depends solely on the dis-
cretion of local government officials. If the free exercise of religion can be subjected
to such a system of discretionary prior restraints, there is no reason to believe that
freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly would fare any better.
Either Judge Breyer has a narrow view of all First Amendment freedoms or he has
a special antipathy for religious freedom. Neither alternative is acceptable for a
member of the United States Supreme Court.

   This Committee was very recently involved in helping to reinstitute a broad basis
of religious freedom for all Americans of all faiths. The Supreme Court's decision
in Smith represented a dramatic departure from established precedent and, more
importantly, from our longstanding national commitment to religious liberty. No
scholar could read Judge Breyer's opinion in New Life and have any doubt that he
would have been part of the majority in the Smith case.

   This Committee is on record endorsing a broad view of religious freedom by its
passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It would be totally inconsistent
to turn immediately around and place a nominee on the same Court who personifies
                                             447

the philosophy of big government and little freedom that this Committee has just
rejected.

  We need Justices who trust Americans much and government little. We need Jus-
tices who readily embrace freedom and rarely embrace government power. Judge
Breyer embraces government power too readily and freedom--especially religious
freedom--far too rarely.

Hon. JOSEPH BIDEN,

221 S.R.O.B, Washington, DC.
   DEAR SENATOR BIDEN: Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with more

information regarding my concerns about Judge Breyer. You will recall that I ques-
tioned Judge Breyer's failure to follow the fact stipulation approved by the lower
court that all the instruction in this school was religious in nature. All subjects are
taught from a Christian perspective.

  You asked me for more information on how math and other subjects can be taught
from a religious perspective and for information on the history of constitutional liti-
gation relative to textbooks. I am happy to supply you with the additional informa-
tion you requested.

   1. Federal cases repeatedly state that academic textbooks can be too religious for
Establishment Clause purposes.

  The Establishment Clause has consistently been interpreted to prohibit the use
of tax money for textbooks or instruction in religious schools, even where the texts
or instruction were in secular subjects like math. See, e.g., Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S.
83 (1968) (taxpayers had standing to sue to stop the teaching of reading and arith-
metic in religious schools); Rhode Island Fed. of Teachers v. Norberg, 479 F.Supp.
1364 (R.I. 1079) (tax deductions for secular textbooks by parochial school families
violates the Establishment Clause because the government would have to inspect
the books to eliminate those with religious content and supervise the schools to
make sure that the books were not used in the course of religious instruction), Pub-
lic Funds for Public Schools v. Marburger, 358 F.Supp. 29 (N.J. 1973) (reimbursing
parents for cost of "secular, nonideological textbooks" violates the Establishment
Clause because the government would have to inspect the books to verify that there
was no religious content and monitor instruction to ensure that they were not used
for religious purposes).

   2. Christian teaching of secular subjects (including math) can be quite religious.
   Consider this Christian Teacher's Manual:
   "The Christian approach to teaching arithmetic begins with knowing and teaching
the students that the universe has structure and order because it was created by
a rational, orderly God. In arithmetic the students study one aspect of the order of
the real world and indirectly begin to know more about the God Who has given
them the world they live in. In the arithmetic processes the students are not creat-
ing truth but learning truth; they are, in a sense, thinking God's thoughts after
Him. The students will find exactness, preciseness, and completeness in the subject
matter of mathematics, just as would be expected in God's world."
   A Beka Mathematics 5 Teacher's Guide, Introduction [attached as Appendix A].
Or consider this, from the Spring, 1968 issue of the The Christian Teacher:
   "A Christian school that is content only with the teaching of manipulatory skills
of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry blinds the student's perception to all but a frac-
tion of the glory of God reflected in the unique mirror of mathematics."
   Even the methods of teaching reflect a distinctively Christian emphasis, as shown
in this Teacher's Guide:
   "We are unabashed advocates of traditional arithmetic, partly because the stu-
dents learn something that can be built upon, but also because it accords with out
Christian viewpoints on education. Only from a Christian perspective can the basic
rationale, the intrinsic reasonableness of traditional elementary arithmetic be seen
and appreciated. Traditional arithmetic will not succeed unless it is taught with the
conviction that something more than arbitrary processes derived from arbitrary
principles is at issue. The elementary student does not need to "understand" 2+2=4
in order to learn it and use it; he will learn the abstract principles later. But the
elementary student does need to see his multiplication tables as part of the truth
and order that Good has built into reality. From the Christina perspective, 2+2=4
takes on cosmic significance, as does every fact of mathematics, however particular!
Traditional elementary arithmetic is Christian elementary arithmetic."

  3. Government officials have repeatedly attempted to interfere with religiously-
motivated parental choices in academics.

  In South San Francisco, lawyers threatened to sue a Christian home-schooling
family which operated under the supervision of a local public school. The family had
chosen religious texts for their public school "Independent Study Program." Because
the family was not a member of HSLDA, we do not know whether they were able
to continue using their religious books.

  Government officials have also objected to the religiously-motivated teaching
methodology outlined above. In Bourne, Massachusetts, for example, Assistant Su-
perintendent Gail Roe examined the A Beka mathematics textbook chosen by a
home schooling family. Dr. Roe objected to the traditional teaching methods used
in the textbook, saying, "This operates at the very lowest level of learning!" (It is
worth noting that the textbooks she criticized are among the most popular texts
used in Christian home and private schools, and that these home and private
schools routinely outscore public schools on standardized tests.)

  Under the same Massachusetts law at issue in New Life, this home-schooling fam-
ily could be prosecuted for criminal truancy unless they received approval in ad-
vance from the local school. Dr. Roe used the power of her position to threaten this
family with prosecution unless they changed their educational choices. With the
help of HSLDA, the family was able to continue to use the religious math textbooks
which they had chosen.

  On a grander scale, Congress is currently weighing legislation which would man-
date the new secular approaches. The House version of the Improving America's
Schools Act, says at H.R. 6 § 1001(cX5):

  "The disproven theory that children must first learn basic skills before engaging
in more complex tasks continues to dominate strategies for classroom instruction,
resulting in emphasis on repetitive drill and practice at the expense of content-rich
instruction, accelerated curricula, and effective teaching to high standards."

  This language, as originally written, would have put the federal government on
record as being against the traditional methodology chosen by religious educators
who believe in moral and mathematical absolutes. Only a massive outcry by private,
religious, and home educators, kept this provision of H.R. 6 from being mandated
for all schoolchildren in America.

  Conclusion.--As you can see, the thrust of my comments were quite accurate al-
though I did not have all the relevant information at my fingertips when you asked
me the question. I appreciate the opportunity to supplement this information, and
ask that it be placed in the record to demonstrate that I answered your public re-
quest.

  Thank you so much for the courtesy to allow me to testify before your committee.
        Very truly yours,

                                                                                     MICHAEL P. FARRIS, ESQ./CG,

  Enclosures: Introduction to A Beka Teachers' Manual for Mathematics 5.

                                                        [APPENDIX A]

           To THE TEACHER: THE CHRISTIAN APPROACH TO TEACHING ARITHMETIC

  The Christian approach to teaching arithmetic begins with knowing and teaching
the students that the universe has structure and order because it was created by
a rational, orderly God. In arithmetic the students study one aspect of the order of
the real world and indirectly begin to now more about the God Who has given them
the world they live in. In the arithmetic processes the students are not creating
truth but learning truth; they are, in a sense, thinking God's thoughts after Him.
The students will find exactness, preciseness, and completeness in the subject mat-
ter of mathematics, just as would be expected in God's world.

  As the content of the arithmetic curriculum and the textbook has reason and
order to it, so must the arithmetic class itself be taught according to an organized,
reasonable plan. A daily class should include oral drill, the teaching of new mate-
rial, practice of new material, and review of basic facts, All four areas need to be
completed in 60 minutes or less time each day. The teacher must have classroom
habits and procedures that will produce an orderly classroom conducive to good
learning.

  Elementary arithmetic, quite naturally, begins with the most elementary, basic
mathematical processes of arithmetic. Students learn best when they proceed from
the particular to the general, from the concrete .to the abstract. Elementary arith-
metic properly emphasizes the facts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and di-
vision that accord with the child's stage of mental development and have immediate
                                         449

practical application. A solid foundation is laid for high school arithmetic which ap-
propriately (but still gradually) introduces the student to a higher level of abstrac-
tion. The student will learn more efficiently and be better at algebra and all higher
mathematics if he masters arithmetic first.

  We are unabashed advocates of traditional arithmetic, partly because the students
learn something that can be built upon, but also because it accords with our Chris-
tian viewpoints on education. Only from a Christian perspective can the basic ra-
tionale, the intrinsic reasonableness of traditional elementary arithmetic be seen
and appreciated. Traditional arithmetic will not succeed unless it is taught with the
conviction that something more than arbitrary processes derived from arbitrary
principles is at issue. The elementary student does need need to "understand" 2+2=4
in order to learn it and use it; he will learn the abstract principles later. But the
elementary student does need to see his multiplication tables as part of the truth
and order that God has built into reality. From the Christian perspective, 2+2=4
takes on cosmic significance, as does every fact of mathematics, however particular!
Traditional elementary arithmetic is Christian elementary arithmetic.

  The way we view a subject matter and the method we think we ought to use to
teach it are always related. Traditional arithmetic goes with traditional teaching
methods, and we believe that these teaching methods also accord with our Christian
perspective. Elementary students are taught the arithmetic facts through oral and
written drill, just as the Bible says, "For precept must be upon precept, upon pre-
cept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little" (Isaiah 28:10).
The elementary students learn the facts by hearing them over and over again. They
need facts in order to think and build up their minds for more abstract mathematics
in high school. The students will need generous amount of oral and written drill
conducted by the teacher to have accuracy and speed in arithmetic.

  A teacher who is faithful in teaching and drilling the facts if arithmetic in a rea-
sonable, consistent way will be teaching much more than the particulars of arith-
metic--such a teacher will be instilling within the students some of the most basic
attitudes that are necessary for knowing and obeying God. C. T. Studd, missionary
to Africa, understood this principle well and used it in his work with a people who
had just risen from the depths of cannibalism. Norman Grubb described Studd's rea-
soning in his biography of the missionary (C. T. Studd, Fort Washington, Pennsylva-
nia, Christian Literature Crusade, 1972, 1974):

  "Every pole had to be exactly the right length, placed at the right angle, etc.; and
he had a purpose in it, for the natives must be taught that good Christianity and
lazy or bad workmanship are an utter contradiction. He believed that one of the
best ways to teach a native that righteousness is the foundation of God's Throne
was my making him see the absolute straightness and accuracy is the only law of
success in material things."

  Traditional arithmetic is Christian arithmetic, and it must be taught by tradi-
tional methods. A rightly taught arithmetic lesson is one more way that a Christian
teacher can instill within students the principles of God's Word.

  Arithmetic 5 is a traditional Christian arithmetic book. You can use this book
with confidence in your Christian classroom, knowing that it accords with the order-
liness and realities of God's world. Day-by-day curriculum to help you teach this
book in the traditional way is available and necessary for the most effective instruc-
tion. A student speed drill and test booklet and fiashcards and other teaching aids
are also available from A Beka Book Publications.

   Upon completion of the work in Arithmetic 5, students should have mastered the
following terms, facts, and concepts:

   1. Review of all addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division facts with their
terminology

   2. Place value of numbers through billions
  3. Review of borrowing and carrying
   4. Multiplication problems with up to four digits in the multiplier
   5. Division problems with up to three digits in the divisor
  6. Checking addition, multiplication, and division problems by casting out 9's
   7. Review of story problems
  8. Review of number averaging
  9. Review of roman numerals
   10. Rounding off whole numbers, decimals, and monsy
   11. English and metric measures
   12. Converting measures within the same system and solving measurement equa-
tions
   13. Fraction terminology and solving problems containing fractions--adding and
subtracting fractions and mixed numbers with a common denominator or having to
find a common denominator--recognizing proper and improper fractions--changing
                                         450

mixed numbers to improper fractions and changing improper fractions to mixed or
whole numbers--subtracting fractions involving borrowing--writing a remainder as
a fraction--multiplying fractions using cancellation--writing a fraction as a deci-
mal--working division problems involving fractions

  14. Factoring
  15. Finding the least common multiple
  16. Divisibility rules
  17. Writing decimals as fractions--adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing
decimals--comparing decimals--renaming decimals--recognizing terminating and
repeating decimals--learning common fraction and decimal equivalents
   18. Reading a thermometer
  19. Converting from a Celsius scale to a Fahrenheit scale and from a Fahrenheit
scale to a Celsius scale
  20. Solving equations
  21. Reading and drawing pictographs, bar graphs, and line graphs
  22. Reading scale drawings
  23. Recognizing and drawing geometric shapes and figures
  24. Finding the perimeter of a rectangle and a square using the formulas
  25. Finding the area of a rectangle and a square using the formulas

  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. Mr. Farris, do you make any distinc-
tion, for purposes of my understanding here, between home school-
ing and religious schooling?

  Mr. FARRIS. Under Massachusetts law and the law of this coun-
try generally, home schooling is a form of private education. Reli-
gious education is a form of private education. Particularly, under
Massachusetts law, there is no such thing as a home school per se.
Home schools are just small private schools where parents teach
their own kids at home.

  What we mean by it in our organization is that we will defend
families who want to choose to teach their children at home. We
believe they have a right to do that constitutionally, and

  The CHAIRMAN. But your umbrella is broader than that, though,
isn't it?

  Mr. FARRIS. Our criticism of Judge Breyer's opinion
  The CHAIRMAN. I'm sorry, I am trying to understand the associa-
tion.
  Mr. FARRIS. The association exclusively defends families that
choose to teach their children at home.
  The CHAIRMAN. But it does not encompass parochial education,
for example, or schools like I recently visited that are run by ortho-
dox Jewish communities, you know, religious schools stated as a
Catholic grade school, a Jewish grade school or whatever?
  Mr. FARRIS. Our organization does not litigate on behalf of pri-
vate institutional religious schools. As a lawyer, I have done so
many times.
  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to make sure I understood, because
the case you are referring to--and correct me if I am wrong--was
not about home schooling in terms of the organization that you rep-
resent. That doesn't mean you shouldn't comment on it. I just want
to make sure I understand. I don't want people walking away mis-
understanding what that case was about beyond the principle. Fac-
tually, that was a religious school, correct?
  Mr. FARRIS. It was an institution
  The CHAIRMAN. AS opposed to a mother and father deciding that
they wished to educate their child at home.
  Mr. FARRIS. That is correct.
                                      451

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU do not represent institutions like the one
that was the focus of the court case in the Breyer case, correct?

  Mr. FARRIS. Normally, we did not, but we did in that particular
case represent that school at the Supreme Court level

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Mr. FARRIS [continuing]. Because the law in Massachusetts is
identical, one and the same law for home schools and private
schools. The devaluation of the right of private schools in Massa-
chusetts was by its very nature the devaluation of the right of
home schools to exist in Massachusetts, and so we undertook free
of charge the representation of that school at the Supreme Court
level.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just say this: I have appreciated the tes-
timony of both of you, and I decry, as you do, Ms. Comstock
Cunningham, the use of a litmus test, a single litmus test to deter-
mine whether a person should sit on the Supreme Court. I don't
want it under Republican administration, and I don't think it is
particularly fitting under this administration.
  With regard to the school case that you mentioned, Mr. Farris,
I have a lot of respect for you personally, as you know, both of you.
Judge Breyer tried to apply the compelling interest test, but I un-
derstand your view that he didn't apply the least restrictive alter-
native test, even though the case was decided before the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act was enacted into law. I have been very
upset with the Christian Schools case, where a person who pays
tithing, but goes into bankruptcy, justifies the court ordering the
church to repay the tithing. I think it is a wrong case and that it
ought to be decided otherwise, and I hope that it will be vocifer-
ously fought on appeal.
  But as I listened to Judge Breyer, he seemed to have an open
mind toward some of the concepts that you are talking about and
did justify his decision in that case on the basis of standards. But
be that as it may, your points are well taken. I am glad to have
your testimony here today.
  Mr. FARRIS. Thank you, Senator Hatch.
  If I could briefly respond, perhaps this would have been a case,
had Judge Breyer had some litigation experience, it might have
helped. The fundamental error that he made was to disregard a
stipulation entered by the parties, which was approved by the Fed-
eral district trial court. The stipulation was that all the education
offered by this private religious school was religious in nature.
They may teach math, they may teach history, they may teach lit-
erature, but they do so from the religious perspective of the school.
  For the judge to ignore that trial stipulation and to substitute his
view that this is simply secular education, we can regulate secular
education however we want, was to ignore the importance of the
trial stipulation and a factual finding by the trial court.
  Senator HATCH. That is a good point, but I also think he came
down on the side that there are certain educational standards that
a State can set even for religious schools. I agree with you, that
is a sticky point that has to be debated and argued.
                                               452

  Mr. FARRIS. Well, there is a wide variety of opinion about the
permissive nature of that, but there is very little opinion that sug-
gests that the standards imposed on private religious schools can
be subjective in nature. And that is what Judge Breyer endorsed,
is a wholly subjective standard.

  Senator HATCH. I have a tendency to be on your side on that
issue, but the fact is that I think we are all learning in this area.
My point is that the Republican administration was accused of a
litmus test on abortion, when in fact that was not the case. I hap-
pen to know, because I know who interviewed the judgeship nomi-
nees, and I know exactly the questions that were asked, and that
wasn't one of them.

  It is certainly quite clear today from the decisions of the Court
that that wasn't one of the tests. But here we have an administra-
tion requiring these litmus tests, and I think your points are well
taken. On the other hand, I don't think we should be imposing our
own litmus test, albeit however strong we feel about it, because I
don't think that a single issue should stop a person from serving
on the Supreme Court, no matter how important they may be, if
that person is otherwise qualified.

  There may be some issues such as the person won't swear to up-
hold the Constitution. I think that is a single litmus test issue that
would disqualify anybody from serving on the Supreme Court. You
may feel deeply enough about your issues that they fit in that cat-
egory, but we up here have to decide these matters on the basis
of the overall record and what we know about the person.

  I just want to tell you that I appreciate your testimony and are
glad to have both of you here.

  The CHAIRMAN. Running the risk of opening up a large area, I
am probably the only one here that is the product of 13 years of
religious education. How the devil do you teach math from a reli-
gious perspective?

  Maybe that explains my difficulty with math. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. I do not think he should answer it. He just gave
a good explanation.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO--seriously, how could you say such an appar-
ently preposterous thing?
  Mr. FARRIS. I was not trying to single out math, Senator Biden.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO; I am singling it out. You said the academic
subjects are taught from a religious perspective. How does one
teach mathematics--how does one teach calculus from a religious
perspective?
  Mr. FARRIS. YOU cannot teach the science of math from a reli-
gious perspective. But what is often done in math books--which
would disqualify them, for example, from Federal funding--is that
the examples used and the illustrations used within the math book
are particularly religious examples, where they will give stories of
the disciples and say three disciples were here
  The CHAIRMAN. Not so; I went through at least 8 years of edu-
cation with those books. I think you are factually incorrect. If that
is true, then you have gained an ally in me. But I think that is
not true. I know of no such place where you can say in a book that
there are 12 disciples, one of them turned on Jesus, and what per-
centage of the disciples turned on Jesus. I know no place that says,
                                         453

hey, by the way, that is not--the school loses Federal funding for
that.

  Mr. FARRIS. Senator Biden, as a matter of litigation, there is no
such case.

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU got it.

  Mr. FARRIS. But as a matter of practical interpretation of the
way the laws are implemented, I am confident in my opinion that
any Federal regulator looking at such a book would raise hackles.
And I could tell you that attorneys--I think of one in south San
Francisco, CA--threatened to sue a family for using such a text-
book

  The CHAIRMAN. NO; I am not talking about a family. I am talking
about the case--the circumstances. I would ask you to supply for
the record anything to sustain your point as it relates to teaching
sciences from a religious perspective and the use of an example
that has a religious grounding to compute and/or to multiply or di-
vide. I mean, I remember the fishes and the loaves, and how did
we get there, and that being used in my math book. I do not have
any further questions.

  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Before I ask you three or four questions,
would you clarify something for me. I think I understand home
schooling, because I have some nephews and a niece that are home-
schooled, and I am quite well-acquainted with it in Iowa. There are
a lot of people in my State who do it. But we always talk of home
schooling in concepts of first amendment rights, and that there is
a religious reason for having home schooling. And I am not saying
that there is anybody who does it for reasons other than for reli-
gious purposes. But can't the concept of home schooling involve
people who want to teach their kids at home, regardless of any reli-
gious reason?
  Mr. FARRIS. Yes, Senator, many do; a goodly percentage. Perhaps
20, 30 percent of the people who are home schooling are not doing
so for any religious reason whatsoever.
   Senator GRASSLEY. From that standpoint, I remember that every
time that Judge Breyer responded to questions about home school-
ing, he always started out with a first amendment basis for his re-
sponse.
  You can leave the first amendment out of it entirely, can't you,
and have a constitutional justification for home schooling?
   Mr. FARRIS. Yes, you can. The 14th amendment due process
clause, protecting the liberty interest of parents to direct the up-
bringing of their children, that has been recognized by the Supreme
Court since the mid-1920's in the Pierce case, recognizes a wholly
nonreligious basis for a constitutional right to home-school your
children, which I believe that all parents possess.

   Senator GRASSLEY. When you are in court on this subject, do you
use a 1st amendment argument, or are you using the 14th amend-
ment argument?

  Mr. FARRIS. Depending on the facts of the particular family, we
use

   Senator GRASSLEY. You could use both.
                                      454
  Mr. FARRIS [continuing]. We have used both, often; sometimes,
we use simply the parents' rights, depending on the factual situa-
tion.
  Senator GRASSLEY. But I believe, as I recall, that it was always
approached by Judge Breyer from a first amendment perspective,
and
  Mr. FARRIS. That is my reading of his testimony as well.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Senator Simpson asked Judge Breyer about
home schooling. Judge Breyer indicated that he had no bias against
home schools, and the judge also testified that he thought the Con-
stitution protected the rights of parents to inculcate religious val-
ues in their children. Additionally, Judge Breyer stated that reli-
gious schooling was constitutionally protected.
  Do these statements provide you with some level of comfort
about Judge Breyer?
  Mr. FARRIS. A very minimal level of comfort, Senator. I am not
so much concerned about his personal opinion and his lack of bias
toward home schools. I am more concerned about this view of our
constitutional rights. His opinion in the New Life case was thor-
ough, it was articulate, it was exhaustive. In that case, he stated
that States have the power, in his words, citing with approval the
Duro case from North Carolina, that they have the right to totally
effectively ban home schooling.
  I dispute that proposition, and someone who cites such a case
with approval embraces its view. He also cites with approval a
sixth circuit rendering of Wisconsin v. Yoder that says that that de-
cision does not state a general proposition, but only applies to the
Amish. I do not believe that, first, any Supreme Court decision fails
to state a general proposition. If you fundamentally misunderstand
the nature of a Supreme Court decision to say that it does not state
a general proposition, we are not dealing with the same theory of
the Supreme Court.
  Second, I do not think that Wisconsin v. Yoder is factually lim-
ited to the Amish. If religious freedom is not for every faith in this
country, we have denied it for all faiths. And I reject the propo-
sition that the Amish and only the Amish have the rights an-
nounced in that case before the Supreme Court. And this Baptist
school in Massachusetts should have had the same rights that the
Amish did in Wisconsin v. Yoder, but they were denied such a
right. I think that that form of religious discrimination, elevating
one faith for protection that no other faith can achieve, is simply
unacceptable, and I would suggest that that is one of the litmus
tests for a Supreme Court nominee that says that only one faith
can have religious freedom in this country, or one aspect of reli-
gious freedom in this country. I think that that is a very, very seri-
ous issue.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Totally unrelated to the subject that you
come here to bring up, I assume that you have observed Judge
Breyer in his general approach to the law, and I guess I want to
tell you a feeling I have, that I believe that he has been fairly dis-
ciplined and restrained in his 15 years as a Federal appellate
judge. I would not put him in the category of a judicial activist, as
I view some people who have been on the Supreme Court during
the sixties and seventies.
                                      455

  Would you generally agree with that statement?
  Mr. FARRIS. Yes, Senator, I would. I would say he is a moderate
in those terms.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Breyer told me in an answer to a ques-
tion that there were, in his words, "vast areas" where Government
could accommodate religion and even provide assistance on a neu-
tral basis. And I do not think that approach means forced secular-
ism that you and I might fear.
  What was your reaction to these comments?
  Mr. FARRIS. I tend to look at things in terms of actual cases, and
Judge Breyer properly refrained from commenting on specific cases
that might come before the Court. I think that Judge Breyer would
probably accept something like Witters v. Washington Department
of Services for the Blind, which I argued before the Supreme Court
where the Supreme Court unanimously said you cannot discrimi-
nate against a person for establishment clause purposes on the
basis that they want to receive a religious education; that as long
as everybody is getting vocational rehabilitation for the blind, you
cannot single out ministers and say they are disqualified for estab-
lishment clause reasons. I would view him as probably accepting
that unanimous ruling of the Supreme Court.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Breyer also indicated that he believed
that institutions such as families, churches, synagogues, have been
restrained in recent decades, and he is open-minded about a num-
ber of prior Court decisions that you and I might think have weak-
ened the family and the force of morality in our society. To me, this
was somewhat a refreshing attitude. Do you have the same reac-
tion that I have about his statements?
  Mr. FARRIS. I find those hopeful on the establishment clause side
of things. The free exercise is where I am much more troubled.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator
Grassley, and I compliment you for your astute line of questioning.
I thought it was particularly relevant.
  Ms. Cunningham and Mr. Farris, thanks, both of you, for your
participation in this hearing, and you can be certain the committee
will take into consideration your comments.
  Thank you very much.
  Mr. FARRIS. Thank you.
  Ms. CUNNINGHAM. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Our next panel includes Jose Trias
Monge, former Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico; Mar-
garet Marshall, vice president and general counsel, Harvard Uni-
versity; Helen Corrothers, National Institute for Justice, and
former U.S. Sentencing Commissioner, Washington.
  I think you are all aware of our 5-minute rule; I guess somebody
is keeping time on it. Judge Trias Monge, we will be happy to hear
from you, sir.
  I might say that I think I have about 8 minutes to get to the
floor for a roll call, and I do not see anybody else sitting around
here, so that if I interrupt your testimony" so that I may leave and
cast my vote, please understand it is not a reflection upon my in-
terest in what you are saying, but it is just that I want to get my
vote in.

                    STATEMENT OF JOSE TRIAS MONGE

  Mr. TRIAS MONGE. Thank you, Senator.
  My name is Jose Trias Monge. I served as chief justice of Puerto
Rico from 1974 to 1985. As part of my duties and pleasure, I have
been a close student for many years of the Supreme Court of the
United States, and given its special relationship to Puerto Rico, of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Their decisions on
insular affairs since the start of the century have been discussed
at length in several of my books. In a 1991 book, I singled out for
special praise several of Judge Breyer's opinions on the subject.
  Puerto Rico is a mixed law jurisdiction. Large areas of its legal
system are governed by the civil tradition and others by common
law. During the early part of this century, the boundary
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I think it would serve your pur-
poses better if I interrupted you before you got into the main thrust
of your remarks. I am informed I have 5 minutes to get to the floor.
  This committee stands in recess until some other member of the
committee returns, so that we may proceed forward. Please forgive
us.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  I must apologize to our witnesses. We are debating one of the
most controversial issues of that every year comes up, and that is
the foreign aid appropriations bill, which lends itself--it is very im-
portant, but occasionally lends itself to some demagoguery on occa-
sion and occasionally lends itself to very difficult votes on occasion.
But there is a whole series of votes, and this is going to continue.
  I failed to announce to the press and everyone here that we are,
as is obvious by now, going right through the lunch hour, and our
fourth panel, which has been brought up but not introduced at this
point, includes several of Judge Breyer's colleagues who know him
in his various capacities as Chief Judge for the First Circuit, a pro-
fessor at Harvard Law School, and his work on the Sentencing
Commission in the late 1980's.
  In addition, we are fortunate to have on this panel a former col-
league of the Chief Judge in the First Circuit, Judge Trias, and
Judge, it is a pleasure to have you here. I appreciate you making
the effort.
  Justice Trias is a former chief justice of the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico, which is located in Judge Breyer's circuit, and cur-
rently serves as counsel to Trias--that is all I have here, but that
is not the whole name of the firm--what is the name of the firm?
  Mr. TRIAS MONGE. Trias & Melendez.
                                             457

  The CHAIRMAN. Trias & Melendez, in San Jose, PR. And I would
like to thank you for being here, Mr. Justice.

  With us also is Margaret Marshall, vice president and general
counsel of Harvard University, where Judge Breyer is employed as
a professor--I guess now, an adjunct professor; is that correct

  Ms. MARSHALL. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Professor of law, in addition to his
duties as Chief Judge of the first circuit.
  Prior to her appointment at Harvard, Ms. Marshall was a part-
ner in the Boston law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart.
  And Helen Corrothers has extensive experience in the field of
criminal justice. She is past president of the American Correction
Association; served with Judge Breyer on the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission. Appointed to the Commission in 1985 by President
Reagan, Ms. Corrothers served on that body until 1991.
  I welcome you all.
  Judge if you would begin, and then we will work our way across.
I thank you very much.
  Mr. TRIAS MONGE. Mr. Chairman, I had started briefly while you
were out. As part of my duties and pleasure, I have been a close
student for many years of the Supreme Court of the United States,
and given its special relationship to Puerto Rico, of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit. Their decisions on insular affairs
since the start of the century have been discussed at length in sev-
eral of my books. In a 1991 book, I singled out for special praise
several of Judge Breyer's opinions on the subject.
  Puerto Rico is a mixed law jurisdiction. Large areas of its legal
system are governed by the civil tradition and others by the com-
mon law. During the early part of this century, the boundary be-
tween the civil and the common law became increasingly blurred.
The lower Federal courts used to decide civil law questions on the
basis of common law doctrines and reverse local rulings with great
frequency. The situation promoted the Supreme Court of the Unit-
ed States to point out repeatedly the deference due to the decisions
of local courts on matters of local law, particularly in the light of
the different conformation of such law.
  In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes:

  This Court has stated many times the deference due to the understanding of the
local courts upon matters of purely local concern. This is especially true in dealing
with the decisions of a court inheriting and brought up in a different system from
that which prevails here. Our appellate jurisdiction is not given for the purpose of
remodelling the Spanish-American law according to common law conceptions, except
so far as that law has to bend to the expressed will of the United States.

  In spite of this and other statements by the Supreme Court of
the United States, the lower Federal courts have sometimes han-
dled civil law questions in diversity cases without proper attention
to civil law sources. In the tradition of Holmes and other distin-
guished members of the Supreme Court through the years, Judge
Breyer has displayed great sensitivity to the civil law roots of sev-
eral areas of Puerto Rican law and the intricacies of the constitu-
tional relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico.

  Judge Breyer has contributed in other, less-known ways to Puer-
to Rican society. Many years ago, I received a phone call from him.
He wanted to know whether I could recommend a candidate for one
                                             458

of his clerkships. I gave him the name of one of our clerks who was
then doing postgraduate work at Yale Law School. That man was
the first Puerto Rican to clerk for a member of the Court of Ap-
peals for the First Circuit. He has been for some years now the
dean of the University of Puerto Rico Law School. Another of Judge
Breyer's clerks was until recently attorney general of Puerto Rico.

  These considerations, to an extent parochial in nature, do not
provide, however, the basic reasons for my endorsing Judge
Breyer's nomination to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court,
after all, seldom deals with Puerto Rican issues. My admiration for
Judge Breyer is rather based on two other considerations: the qual-
ity of his judicial thinking

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I hate to do this to you. I just got a phone
call, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chief
of staff of the White House are on the telephone and asked whether
I would join them briefly on a conference call to discuss a matter
that is of some urgency, which is the crime bill. With your permis-
sion, I would like to recess for about 3 minutes to see if I can ar-
range to do that another time.

  With that, I will recess just for a few minutes. I am going to be
right back here on the telephone, and I will come right back in.

  [Recess.J
  Senator HATCH [presiding]. Judge Monge, why don't you con-
tinue?
  Mr. TRIAS MONGE. Senator, I was about to finish. I had been
talking about some of Judge Breyer's positions with reference to
the distinction between the attention due to civil law questions and
diversity cases. But I was saying also that those were not the rea-
sons for my admiration for Judge Breyer, and that that is, rather,
based on two further considerations--the quality of his judicial
thinking, and his worth as a human being. Judge Breyer, to my be-
lieve, is blessed with a wide-ranging, inquisitive intellect, solid
learning, and a passion for fairness. As a human being, I have
found him to possess a great capacity for friendship, a warm, car-
ing manner, and deep respect for the opinions of others.
  I believe that, should you decide to confirm him, Judge Breyer
certainly would be not only a good Justice of the United States Su-
preme Court, but that he has the makings of a truly great Justice.
  Thank you.

  My name is Jose Trias Monge. I served as Chief Justice of Puerto Rico from 1974
to 1985.

  As part of my duties and pleasure I have been a close student for many years
of the Supreme Court of the United States and, given its special relationship to
Puerto Rico, of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Their deci-
sions on insular affairs since the start of the century have been discussed at length
in several of my books. In a 1991 book I singled out for special praise several of
Judge Breyer's opinions on the subject.1

   Puerto Rico is a mixed law jurisdiction. Large areas of its legal system are gov-
erned by the civil tradition and others by the common law. During the early part
of this century, the boundary between the civil and the common law became increas-
ingly blurred. The lower federal courts used to decide civil law questions on the
basis of common law doctrines and reverse local rulings with great frequency. The
situation prompted the Supreme Court of the United States to point out repeatedly
the deference due to the decisions of local courts on matters of local law, particularly
in the light of the different conformation of such law. In the words of Oliver Wendell
Holmes: "This Court has stated many times the deference due to the understanding
of the local courts upon matters of purely local concern. * * * This is especially true
in dealing with the decisions of a court inheriting and brought up in a different sys-
tem from that which prevails here. Our appellate jurisdiction is not given for the

tions except so far as that law has to bend to the expressed will of the United
States." 2

   In spite of this and other statements by the Supreme Court of the United States,
the lower federal courts have sometimes handled civil law questions in diversity
cases without proper attention to civil law sources. In the tradition of Holmes and
other distinguished members of the Supreme Court through the years, Judge Breyer
has displayed great sensitivity to the civil law roots of several areas of Puerto Rican
law and the intrincacies of the constitutional relationship between the United States
and Puerto Rico.3

  Judge Breyer has contributed in other, less known ways to Puerto Rican society.
Many years ago I received a phone call from him. He wanted to know whether I

                STATEMENT OF MARGARET H. MARSHALL

  Ms. MARSHALL. Senator Hatch, it is a particular pleasure for me
to appear before this committee today to testify on behalf of Judge
Stephen Breyer.

  I knew Judge Breyer first as a member of the bar, and I ap-
peared before him in the first circuit court of appeals. I may be one
of the few witnesses here today who has actually had the pleasure,
I might say, of appearing before Judge Breyer, and I came to know
him as well in my capacity as president of the Boston Bar Associa-
tion, and I know him more recently as a friend.

  I have a peculiar and deep respect for an independent judiciary
and the role that it plays in our society. My respect stems from my
perspective as an immigrant from South Africa, where in the past,
the judiciary in that country too often rubber-stamped apartheid-
suppressive laws and failed to protect its citizens.

  By contrast, in this country, we have the protection of independ-
ent judges, women and men of integrity and courage, and Judge
Breyer is an outstanding example of those qualities.

  First, as a lawyer appearing in the first circuit, it is always a
pleasure to draw Judge Breyer as a member of the panel. Any ap-
pellate advocate wants to believe that oral argument before a court
can make a difference, and that is so with Judge Breyer; one feels
as if he has focused on the issues and that he sees the case not
as an abstraction but as a reality for the parties involved. In his
questioning, he can be serious and attentive, but also witty. And
to appear before Judge Breyer is to appear before a "hot bench,"
as we say. The questions are many and demanding, and one is re-
lieved when the argument draws to a close, but also disappointed
that his questions do not continue.

   Senator HATCH. He and Justice Ginsburg are going to enjoy each
other, I think.

  Ms. MARSHALL. I think there is going to be an interesting issue
on that question when he is there.

   Senator HATCH. That is correct.
  Ms. MARSHALL. With so many women now admitted to the bar,
permit me to add one historical observation. A decade or more ago,
there were not many of us who appeared in court, and I always
had a sense when a judge was really listening, even though a
woman was speaking. And long before I knew Judge Breyer person-
ally, I recognized him as someone who did listen to women and
who did not permit bias to influence his decisions, and who could
be persuaded to change his mind by skillful advocacy.
  As an officer and later president of the Boston Bar Association,
I had many occasions in which to observe Judge Breyer in a dif-
ferent role. First, he is an admirer of lawyers, and not all judges
evince the same view. He welcomes our participation in the judicial
process; he wants them to be well-informed. Judge Breyer is gener-
ous with his time, always willing to meet with bar representatives
                                      461

or to appear as a speaker on legal education panels. He listens and
responds. Indeed, he does not wait to be approached by the bar, but
often reaches out to make sure that lawyers understand changes
in the rules or other matters of importance.

  It was Judge Breyer who first suggested--and perhaps the chair-
man might be interested in this--that he discuss with lawyers the
changes contemplated by the Judicial Improvement Act of 1990 and
to alert advocates to the significant changes that were con-
templated by the civil justice expense and delay reduction plans.

  I know there has been testimony about the site of the new Fed-
eral courthouse in Boston, but I should say that before the site was
selected, Judge Breyer approached members of the bar to ascertain
our views, and as you know, he arranged for lawyers and citizens
to meet with the architects and others to discuss their concerns.

  In fact, Judge Breyer is always ready to talk with any group of
lawyers or to appear at any event if it is helpful to lawyers or
judges; and he is as thoughtful and helpful with new members of
the bar as he is with established bar leaders and litigators.

  I recall a talk that he gave some years ago at the American Bar
Association, at its ceremony at the Franklin Flaschner Judicial
Award, given each year to an outstanding jurist of a court of lim-
ited jurisdiction. Not so many attend that particular ABA ceremony
each year--certainly not the many hundreds who flock to the meet-
ings of the big ABA sections---but, as is typical of him, Judge
Breyer took the assignment seriously, and he chose on that occa-
sion to reflect on the relationship between appellate judges and
those whose decisions are reviewed on appeal.

  It was as thoughtful aim to meet illuminating talk reflecting real
sensitivity and insight on the role of appellate judicial making de-
livered to judges who had a real interest in the subject. In fact,
Judge Breyer has worked hard and effectively to bridge the gap
that often exists between judges and lawyers, and every bar presi-
dent will be fortunate to have as a chief in her circuit a judge of
Judge Breyer's qualities.

  As I said, I have also known Judge Breyer personally for a num-
ber of years, and let me make a few comments about him as a
friend. His qualities include enthusiasm, willingness to listen, in-
terest in a wide range of subjects, humor, and gentleness.

  I think of another great first circuit judge, Calvert Magruder, the
first Supreme Court law clerk of Justice Brandeis, later a close
friend to Justice Frankfurter and himself a distinguished member
of the Harvard Law School faculty. Judge Magruder was known for
his intelligence, his fairness, his integrity and his realism, and
Judge Breyer is a man I believe in the Magruder tradition, as a
Justice of the Supreme Court, he would give distinguished service
to this Nation, even as we in Massachusetts would regret his de-
parture from the first circuit.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary:
  It is a particular pleasure for me to appear before you today to testify on behalf
of Judge Stephen Breyer. I knew him first as a member of the bar, and I appeared
before in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. I came to know him as well in my ca-
pacity as President of the Boston Bar Association and related bar activities. And I
know him more recently as a friend.
  I have a peculiar and deep respect for an independent judiciary and the role that
it plays in our society. My respect stems from my perspective as an immigrant from
South Africa, where in the past the judiciary too often rubber stamped apartheid's
oppressive laws and failed to protect its citizens. In this country we have the protec-
tion of independent judges, women and men of integrity and courage. Judge Breyer
is an outstanding example of those qualities.
  First, as a lawyer appearing in the Federal Circuit it is always a pleasure to draw
Judge Breyer as a member of the panel. Any appellate advocate wants to believe
that oral argument before a court can make a difference, and that is so with Judge
Breyer. One feels as if he has focused on the issues, and that he sees a case not
as an abstraction but as a reality for the parties involved. In his questioning he can
be serious and attentive, but also witty. To appear before Judge Breyer is to appear
before a "hot" bench; the questions are many, and demanding. One is both relieved
when argument draws to a close, but also disappointed that his questions do not
continue.
  With so many women now admitted to the bar, permit me to add one historical
observation. A decade and more ago there were not many of us who appeared in
court. I could always sense when a judge was really listening, even though a woman
was speaking. Long before I knew Judge Breyer personally, I recognized him as
someone who did listen to women, who did not permit bias to influence his deci-
sions, and who could be persuaded to change his mind by skillful advocacy.
  As an officer and later President of the Boston Bar Association, I had many occa-
sions on which to observe Judge Breyer in a different role. First he is an admirer
of lawyers. (Not all judges evince the same view). He welcomes their participation
in the judicial process. He wants them to be well informed. Judge Breyer is gener-
ous with his time, always willing to meet with Bar representatives or to appear as
a speaker on legal education panels. He listens and responds; indeed, he does not
wait to be approached by the Bar but often reaches out to make sure that lawyers
understand changes in the rules or other matters of importance. It was Judge
Breyer who first suggested that he discuss with lawyers the changes contemplated
by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, and to alert advocates to the significant
changes that were contemplated by the civil justice expense and delay reduction
plans. Before the site of the new Federal court house in Boston was selected, Judge
Breyer approached members of the Bar to ascertain their views. He arranged for
lawyers and citizens to meet the architect to discuss their concerns.
                                      463

Judge Breyer is always ready to talk with any group of lawyers or to appear at
any event if it is helpful to lawyers or judges. He is as thoughtful and helpful with
new members of the bar as he is with established Bar leaders and litigators. I recall
a talk that he gave some years ago at the American Bar Association at the cere-
mony of the "Franklin Flaschner Judicial Award" given each year to an outstanding
jurist of a court of limited jurisdiction. Not so many attend that particular ABA
ceremony each year--certainly not the many hundreds who flock to the meetings
of the big ABA sections. As is typical of him, Judge Breyer took the assignment seri-
ously, and chose on that occasion to reflect on the relationship between appellate
judges and those whose decisions are reviewed on appeal. It was a thoughtful and--
to me--illuminating talk, reflecting real sensitivity and insight on the role of appel-
late judicial making, delivered to judges who had a real interest in the subject.
Judge Breyer has worked hard and effectively to bridge the gap between judges and
lawyers. Every bar president would be fortunate to have as the Chief in her Circuit
a judge of Judge Breyer's qualities.

I have known Judge Breyer personally for a number of years, and let me make
a few comments about him as a friend. His qualities include enthusiasm, willing-
ness to listen, interest in a wide range of subjects, humor, gentleness. In a crowded
room he will notice who is excluded, and move to include them. I have been taken
aback at the suggestion that Judge Breyer lacks passion: one senses always his en-
thusiasm, and his intensity. It is true that one sometimes has to run to keep up
with him, but the attempt to keep up is a pleasure.

I think of another great First Circuit Judge, Calvert Magruder, the first Supreme
Court law clerk of Justice Brandeis, later close to Justice Frankfurter, and himself
a distinguished member of     ftahiernHesasr,vianrtdegLriatywaSncdhoreoal lfisamcu.l"tyx .JuJuddggeeBMreyaegrruidsear  was
known for his "intelligence,                                                                                           man
in the Magruder tradition. As a Justice of the Supreme Court he would give distin-
guished service to this Nation, even as we in Massachusetts would regret his depar-
ture from the First Circuit.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Ms. Marshall.
Ms. Corrothers.

                 STATEMENT OF HELEN G. CORROTHERS

  Ms. CORROTHERS. Yes, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee. It is so good to see you again. I still remember and appre-
ciate the support that you and this committee rendered for our ef-
forts on the Commission.

  The CHAIRMAN. We appreciate the work you did. It was heavy
lifting.

  Ms. CORROTHERS. That is right. Thank you.
  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee
today to support the nomination and recommend confirmation of
the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, first circuit, Stephen
Breyer, for the post of Associate Justice, U.S. Supreme Court.
  I would like to offer what may be for you a different kind of testi-
mony. You have no doubt been inundated with opinions attesting
to Judge Breyer's important educational and professional creden-
tials, with statements about his wit, keen intelligence and knowl-
edge. And I agree with all of these assessments.
  But I invite you to share my perspectives concerning Steve
Breyer as an associate and fellow human being in a professional
setting. Steve and I were colleagues at the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission, and I am going to address the qualities and traits that I
observed during that period.
  It is important to consider the fact that, at the beginning of our
work effort, it was necessary for us during a short period of time
to find office space, hire staff, develop an organizational structure,

        go, George "A History of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: Volume
1, 1891-1960," p. 216.
                                              464

begin and complete the initial set of guidelines, an unprecedented
task, and at the same time deal with numerous issues concerning
each area of concern addressed by the guidelines.

  During this early period and at different points later, long hours
and hard work proved to be routine. It was a time when seven peo-
ple, all eager to make a personal contribution to the product, were
faced with the knowledge that there was not an automatic consen-
sus on important issues.

  Hectic periods of this sort often brings out the worst traits in
people. So it is meaningful for you to know that it is from this in
the trenches perspective that I saw Steve Breyer's true character.
Also, it will be necessary for me to examine Judge Breyer's quali-
ties against the background of my own personal values.

  The first trait I would like to mention is Steve Breyer's ability
to relate to persons from diverse backgrounds. Judge Breyer is
from a world of privilege, from the I believe western and north-
eastern part of the country. Conversely, I am from a background
of poverty, from the southern part of the country. As a woman born
of African descent in the rural segregated South. It would not be
surprising if we failed to relate to each other.

  However, I found that I could relate to him and his ideas. I also
noted that, as Steve Breyer listened to my opinions on various mat-
ters of the years, that he had the extraordinary ability to not just
listen, but to hear and to comprehend the information. He under-
stood that each Commissioner brought a different strength and per-
spective to the Commission, and that we each had something of im-
port to share.

  Moreover, he could articulate or accurately communicate our
views in subsequent discussions or in his famous amazingly clear,
I guess you could call them summations or review of all matters
covered before decisions were made.

  I would like to mention why I value this attribute. We are a di-
verse nation. We have different professions. There are differences
that are physical, such as race, gender and age. Additional dif-
ferences are less visible, but also important, such as cultural herit-
age, personal background, functional expertise, and certain
strengths and skills which are both inherited and learned.

  The Nation is best served, if the Justices on the court of last re-
sort are able to understand, then communicate and articulate that
understanding, as the law is construed and applied to particular
situations.

  The second trait I observed was one of accountability. I believe
that Steve Breyer holds the same commitment as I do about the
importance of accountability in a criminal justice system that
strives for effectiveness. Now, such a system must be strong on ac-
countability and replete with fairness.

  Of course, as you know, the Commission's overall goal had to do
with providing a structure and framework for sentencing decisions,
so that similar offenders who commit similar offenses are sen-
tenced in a similar fashion or to enhance fairness.

  I came to believe that Steve Breyer cared about this precious en-
tity. He shared significant sensitivity to my deep-seated concerns
about fairness. A person from my background might view justice as
a hoped-for miracle, and fairness as a scarce and valuable commod-
                                      465

ity. I think Steve Breyer on the highest court can contribute to the
dispensation of that precious commodity called justice.

  I would like to mention briefly industriousness. It is relevant to
this appointment to note that Steve Breyer is one of the hardest
working people that I know. His thoroughness and preparation for
our meetings on the Commission was key to his ability to serve as
a stimulus for compromise. Not only was it necessary for him to re-
search and think through his own perspective or position on subject
issues, but it was necessary for him to examine the issues from a
variety of perspectives.

  His penchant for hard work and thorough preparation, along
with his God-given wisdom, enabled him to synthesize the various
seemingly dissimilar ideas sufficiently to be the leader in effecting
compromise on numerous occasions.

  I would be remiss, if I failed to note his temperament, his pleas-
ant disposition and respectful treatment of staff and other individ-
uals with whom he had contact on a routine basis.

  Finally, Judge Stephen Breyer is a man who can relate to all
Americans, and he is fair, a man of great integrity and sound judg-
ment. He is a decent human being. I am confident that should you
confirm him, he will through his service on the Court bring great
honor on this committee, President Clinton and to our Nation.

                            PREPARED STATEMENT OF HELEN G. CORROTHERS

                                                     CURRICULUM VITAE

  Aug 1993 recipient of her profession's highest award, the E.R. Cass Correctional
Service Award from the American Correctional Assn.

  A native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Helen G. Corrothers recently completed a term
of office as the President of the American Correctional Association, the largest cor-
rectional association in the world. In 1985, she was appointed by President Ronald
Reagan to the post of Commissioner, United States Sentencing Commission. She
served in this capacity from October 1985-November 1, 1991. The Commission's
purpose is to meet the Congressionally imposed mandate, which includes the estab-
lishment of sentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system
that meet the established purposes of sentencing and ensure certainty and fairness
while avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among like defendants.
Corrothers received her first appointment from President Reagan in 1983 to the
United States Parole Commission. In addition to her national policy development
and formulation responsibilities, she assumed command in January, 1984, for the
fourteen-state Western Region with headquarters in Burlingame, California. This
position included responsibility for administration, release decisions, the training of
several hundred probation officers and quasi-judicial duties to include the issuance
of summons, warrants, and subpoenas that were implemented by the United States
Marshals Service.

   Prior to her federal posts, she was Superintendent/Warden of the Women's Cor-
rectional Facility for the State of Arkansas. Violent offenders consistently con-
stituted the bulk of the prison population throughout her tenure. She developed a
successful program of administration and rehabilitation and ensured the facility's
recognition through receipt of national accreditation. Additionally, she is a veteran.
She advanced through the ranks in the United States Army from Private to Captain
and served with distinction in the Far East, Europe, and the United States. She was
Distinguished Military Graduate from Officer Leadership School and has received
the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Army Com-
mendation Medal.

   She has served on numerous local, state, and federal policy-making boards, has
extensive experience in the Criminal Justice field and has received numerous
awards for her contribution to the field of corrections. She is currently an officer
and member of the Executive Committee of the American Correctional Association;
an officer and member of the National Board of Directors for the Volunteers of
America, Inc.; and member of the National Board of Directors for The National As-
                                             466

sembly of National Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations, Inc. She is
included in the "International Directory of Distinguished Leadership" and is fea-
tured by the Marquis Publication Board in their editions of "Who's Who of American
Women" and "Who's Who in the World."

  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Helen G. Corrothers. I am
from Pine Bluff, Arkansas. A retired member of the United States Sentencing Com-
mission and currently a Visiting Fellow, conducting a research project, at the Na-
tional Institute of Justice. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the commit-
tee today to support the nomination and recommend confirmation of the Chief
Judge, United States Courts of Appeals, First Circuit, Stephen Breyer for the post
of Associate Justice, United States Supreme Court.

  I would like to offer, what may be for you, a different kind of testimony. You have
no doubt been inundated with opinions attesting to Judge Breyer's important edu-
cational and professional credentials, with statements about his wit, keen intel-
ligence and knowledge and I agree with all of these assessments. But, I invite you
to share my perspectives concerning Steve Breyer as an associate and fellow human
being in a professional setting.

  Steve and I were colleagues at the U.S. Sentencing Commission and I am going
to address the qualities and traits that I observed during that period. It is impor-
tant to consider the fact that at the beginning of our work effort, it was necessary
for us (during a short period of time) to find office space, hire staff, develop an orga-
nizational structure, begin and complete the initial set of guidelines (an unprece-
dented task), and at the same time deal with numerous issues concerning each area
of concern addressed by the guidelines. During this early period and at different
points later, long hours and hard work proved to be routine. It was a time when
seven people, all eager to make a personal contribution to the product were faced
with the knowledge that there was not an automatic consensus on important issues.
Hectic periods of this sort often bring out the worst traits in people. It is meaningful
for you to know that it is from this "in the trenches" perspective that I saw Steve
Breyer's true character. Also, it will be necessary for me to examine Judge Breyer's
qualities against the background of my own personal values.

  The first trait to be mentioned is Steve Breyer's ability to relate to persons from
diverse backgrounds.

  Judge Breyer is from a world of privilege, from the western and northeastern part
of the country. Conversely, I am from a background of poverty, from the southern
part of the country. As a woman, born of African descent, in the rural segregated
south, it would not be surprising if we failed to relate to each other. However, I
found that I could relate to him and his ideas. I also noted that as Steve Breyer
listened to my opinions on various matters over the years, that he had the extraor-
dinary ability to not just listen, but to hear and to comprehend the information. He
understood, that each commissioner brought a different strength and perspective to
the commission and that we each, had something of import to share. Moreover, He
could later articulate or accurately communicate our views in subsequent discus-
sions or in his famous (amazingly clear) "summations" or review of all matters cov-
ered before decisions were made.

  Why do I value this attribute?
  We are a diverse nation, we have different professions, there are differences that
are physical, such as race, gender and age. Additional differences are less visible,
but also important, such as cultural heritage, personal background, functional ex-
pertise, and certain strengths and skills which are inherited and learned. The na-
tion is best served if the justices on the court of last resort are able to understand
then communicate and articulate that understanding, as the law is construed and
applied to particular situations.
  The second relevant trait--Accountability. Because of the death of my father
when I was 2 years old, my mother proved to be the sole source for a personal value
system, that I still treasure today. The work ethic and accountability are high on
the list. I believe Steve Breyer holds the same commitment to the importance of ac-
countability in a criminal justice system that strives for effectiveness. Such a system
must be strong on accountability and replete with fairness.
  Fairness. The Commission's overall goal and our mandate from Congress was to
provide a structure and framework for sentencing decisions so that similar offenders
who commit similar offenses are sentenced in a similar fashion, or to enhance fair-
ness. Steve Breyer displayed significant sensitivity to our goal and my deep seated
concerns for fairness. I came to believe that he, too, cared about this precious entity.
Persons coming from my background might view justice as a "hoped for miracle"
and fairness as "a scarce and valuable" commodity. I think Steve Breyer, on the
                                             467

highest court, can contribute to the dispensation of that precious commodity called
"justice."

  Industriousness. It is relevant to this appointment to note that Steve Breyer is
one of the hardest working people I know. His thoroughness in preparation for our
meetings on the commission was key to his ability to serve as the stimulus for com-
promise. Not only was it necessary for him to research and think through his own
perspective or position on the subject issues but it was necessary for him to examine
the issues from a variety of perspectives. His penchant for hard work and thorough
preparation, along with his God given wisdom, enabled him to synthesize the var-
ious, seemingly dissimilar ideas, sufficiently to be the leader in effecting compromise
on numerous occasions.

  I would be remiss if I failed to note his temperament. His pleasant disposition
and respectful treatment of staff and other individuals with whom he had contact
on a routine basis.

  Finally, Judge Stephen Breyer is a man who can relate to all Americans and he
is fair. A man of great integrity and sound judgment. He is a decent human being.
I am confident that, should you confirm him, he will through his service on the
court, bring great honor on this committee, President Clinton and to our nation.

  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I thank all three of you. Your testimony from three different per-
spectives of your relationships with Judge Breyer are helpful,
meaningful and are very much appreciated by the committee. I
know you have all come a long way to be able to make these state-
ments. We appreciate your accommodating the hectic and difficult
schedule of the Senate. I thank you all very much for being here.
  Mr. CORROTHERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, our next panel is comprised of a total of
four witnesses, I believe all four in opposition to the nomination of
Judge Breyer. On this panel is Ralph Nader, founder of the Center
for Responsive Law. Dr. Sidney Wolfe is also here. He is director
of Public Citizen's Health Research Group.
  Also on the panel is Lloyd Constantine, a lawyer in the field of
antitrust and a partner in the firm of Constantine & Associates. In
addition, Mr. Constantine teaches antitrust law at Fordham Uni-
versity School of Law and is a former assistant attorney general for
antitrust enforcement for the State of New York. And Mr. Ralph
Estes also joins this panel. Mr. Estes is a professor of business ad-
ministration at the American University here in Washington. Pro-
fessor Estes has written in the area of corporate regulation and is
currently a fellow at the Center for the Advancement of Public Pol-
icy.
  I welcome you all. I guess we caught Mr. Nader off-guard with
the last panel, and I apologize for that. Unless you all would prefer
to proceed in another way, I would suggest we proceed in the order
in which you were recognized, Mr. Nader, Dr. Wolfe, Mr. Con-
stantine, and Mr. Estes.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, before this panel begins, I
committed to be elsewhere at 2 o'clock, at a press conference on
health care. I am particularly interested in what this panel has to
say. I hope to come back before the panel concludes its delibera-
tions, but I do not want to be interpreted that my leaving is from
a lack of interest or support. I am very interested in what they
have to say, and I just wanted to make that statement before I ex-
cused myself in about 5 minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
                                             468

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, if I could just say I am going to
the same press conference on health care.

  The CHAIRMAN. One thing Mr. Nader understands is press con-
ferences, and I am sure he will understand your need to be there.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Also, he understands health care.
  The CHAIRMAN. He understands health care, as well. As a matter
of fact, I am surprised he is not going to the press conference with
you.
  Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I am told there is going to be a
vote at 1:45 p.m.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am glad to be informed of all these things. Why
don't we just begin and we will see where the schedule takes us.
  Mr. Nader, welcome.

PANEL CONSISTING OF RALPH NADER, WASHINGTON, DC; SID-
  NEY M. WOLFE, CITIZEN'S GROUP, WASHINGTON, DC; LLOYD

  NY; AND RALPH ZESTES, KOGOD COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AD-

                        STATEMENT OF RALPH NADER

  Mr. NADER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee.

  I would like to submit my 20-page testimony and note that there
are five important attachments: First, one by Professor Carstensen,
of the University of Wisconsin Law School, dealing with the case
of price squeeze that was so widely discussed earlier in these hear-
ings, a case by Judge Breyer; second, a thorough critique by a
friend of Judge Breyer, but he is a critic, Professor Tom McGarity,
of the University of Texas Law School, on Judge Breyer's health
and environmental safety positions; third, a critique of Judge
Breyer's chapter on the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
tration, by Clarence Ditlow and Joan Claybrook, which illustrates
that some of Judge Breyer's research is quite shoddy; fourth, a list
of very stimulating questions by Prof. Richard Parker, of Harvard
Law School, on the first amendment and its interpretation to pro-
vide affirmative opportunities for ordinary citizens to participate in
their democracies, the exercise of free speech; and, fifth, an 11-page
letter by Prof. Monroe Freedman, the legal ethicist, where he con-
cludes that Judge Breyer violated the disqualifications statute. I
hope they will be included in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. The entire statement, along with the attach-
ments. Would you clarify for the record, Mr. Nader, are all five of
the people on behalf whose statements you are submitting com-
ments, are all five of those opposed to Mr. Breyer?

  Mr. NADER. Professor Freedman is. The others have not ex-
pressed their opposition.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. They will all be placed in the record.
  Mr. NADER. Thank you.
  One point on process, I think the White House process of sifting
through nominations, which was managed by Lloyd Cutler, is ex-
tremely tainted and unfair and raises an issue within the Judiciary
Committee's jurisdiction. A man who is still special counsel to a
                                      469

corporate law firm is also special counsel to President Clinton
under a statute that allows a 130-day tenure.

  It was never intended for the position of counsel to the President,
which was intended for specialized people like scientists and geolo-
gists, to spend some time advising the Federal Government. I think
that this should never be allowed again. It has never occurred in
American history, that a special counsel to the President is still a
special counsel to his corporate law firm down the street and will
have I think a relatively baleful effect on the integrity of the proc-
ess.

  Second, the law has many purposes, three of which are to dis-
cipline the excesses of power, to reflect reality in the facts on the
ground, and to facilitate the exercise of ordinary citizens' political
and civic energies. That is to facilitate democracy. I think on all
three grounds, Judge Breyer is seriously deficient, whether we look
at his decisions, his books, his articles, and other activities.

  The conservation of existing power alignments has been a prior-
ity for Judge Breyer. He has not been interested in curbing, dis-
solving, displacing or holding such corporate power accountable.
We have gone through a number of years where the Wall Street
Journal itself has reported time and time again the elements of
what constitutes a corporate crime wave. Whether it is procure-
ment fraud, whether it is the S&L debacle, whether it is health
care industry fraud, on and on, the context for elaborating on
Judge Breyer's specialty in the regulatory area is the corporate
crime wave and the exceptional growth of corporate power over
many other areas of our life.

  His record on antitrust is extraordinarily one-sided. No judge on
the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has a higher percentage of
ruling against plaintiffs who are using the antitrust laws to hold
corporate defendants accountable. The Wall Street Journal, the
business community, corporate commentators and their counter-
parts in the Senate have serious reasons why they are for Judge
Breyer, and those reasons relate to their belief that he will accom-
modate, support, and defend the existing pattern of concentrated
business power in our country against their challengers.

  Second, in the area of regulations, I think his scholarship is mi-
nutely shoddy, because his factual predicates are so faulty. He be-
littles hazards and risks and exaggerates costs. He also exagger-
ates what the Government has actually spent or required to be
spent to reduce risks.

  I think in many ways, Mr. Chairman, the statement where he
says at all times regulation will reduce some people's income. It il-
lustrates the fantasy world that he is operating in. Prevention of
death and injury does not reduce anybody's income except funeral
directors' income. I think in many ways his analysis, and I detail
it in my testimony, is simplistic, superficial, and ridden with fan-
tasy.

  If he is sincere, he is unrealistic. And if he is not sincere, he has
developed an elaborate technique for paralysis analysis, a kind of
multiple overlapping constantly intermodal consideration that the
business community doesn't operate under, that the Government
doesn't operate under, and no human being should operate under.
                                             470

  He also filters out from his analysis of how Congress and the reg:
ulatory agencies work, all the corporate impact in this city. It is as
if they are neuter factors and anonymous factors. The issue of
greed, avarice, obstructionism, delay, campaign funds, all the reali-
ties that we know that corporations engage in to get their way in
this city, whether from regulatory agencies or Members of Con-
gress, are left out of his analysis. How can that be pragmatic? How
can that be realistic? How can that be scholarly?

  But my principal criticism of Judge Breyer, Mr. Chairman, is
that he is uniquely disinterested in fostering or recognizing the
elaboration of democratic public participation. In his proposal for
regulatory reform, he discounts the efficacious role of Congress, the
courts, the liability laws, good appointments to regulatory agencies,
and expanding the breadth and depth of democratic public consid-
erations and participation. This is being antidemocratic in a rather
affirmative manner.

  It is inconceivable that a judge with any knowledge of American
history can so denigrate the great successes in our Government
and our society from giving people more rights to know, more
rights to participate, more rights to communicate their preferences
through the processes of government.

  In conclusion,.Mr. Chairman, a nominee such as Judge Breyer,
who is insensitive to the laws' needs to discipline the excesses and
concentrations of corporate power, a nominee who rests his propos-
als on erroneous reality, factual error and fantasy, and, above all,
a nominee who rejects the efficacy of ever-improving democratic
participation by the people in making these agencies of Govern-
ment work better is neither pragmatic, neither realistic, nor mod-
erate. He is extremist. He is ridden with fantasy, and he is insensi-
tive on the ground to the health and safety needs of the American
people, and his nomination should be rejected on those grounds

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                 O.S. Senate, Washington, D.C., July 15, 1994

        Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
thank you for this brief opportunity to testify on the nomination
of Judge Stephen G. Breyer for the position of Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States. With such bipartisan
support for his confirmation, it is important for critics of
Judge Breyer to have their say, if not for expectation of
persuasion, then at least for whatever constitutional symbolism
such dissent may provide.

        Two preliminary process points need to be made. First, as
reported in the New York Times and by other sources, Lloyd N.
Cutler was in charge of the White House group sifting possible
nominees to recommend to the President. Mr. Cutler is still
special counsel to the corporate law firm of Wiliner, Cutler and
Pickering and has not resigned that position. At the same time,
he is also special counsel to the President. This dual status is
unprecedented and deplorably blurs the sharp boundary between
public and private service. (Mr. Cutler can still take his draw,
by the end of the year, from his law firm.) President Clinton is
relying on 18 U.S.C. sec.203 to allow Mr. Cutler to serve up to
130 days in a 365-day period without complying with a number of
conflict-of-interest and disclosure statutes. No one ever
intended this status of special government employee (SGE) to
apply to the position of White House counsel. Most SGEs are
scientists or other specialists who are paid by the government to
work as advisors or to take on small discrete projects.

        The issue is not just what the law does or does not permit
in the area of ethics, since the President has imposed much
stricter limits on his staff, prior to the arrival of Mr. Cutler,
than the law requires. Instead, the issue is whether it is proper
for a member of a major Washington law firm to also serve as
counsel to the President, pass on judicial nominations, engage in
all kinds of important decisions which can have substantial
benefit to some or most of the many corporate clients of his firm
(auto, banking, chemical, drug, mining and other commercial
interests), even if he does not work on matters directly
impacting those clients. His role in the selection of Judge
Breyer was, according to many sources, critical: at every key

 85-742 - 95 - 16
                                  472

juncture, Mr. Cutler gently tilted the process toward Judge
Breyer, a long-time professional, philosophical and personal
colleague, with whom he was co-counsel on a merger case, and co-
associate on other professional missions. Judge Breyer was the
choice of Lloyd Cutler, special counsel both to the President and
to his corporate law firm. The Clinton White House process was
both tainted and unfair!

          Second, I support Senator Arlen Specter's view that nominees
are less likely to answer questions when the confirmation process
is seen as a sure matter. Also, some Senators are less inclined
to take the time to ask those questions. Citizens and citizen
groups, critical of nominees, are less likely to bother
requesting to testify. "Why spend the time?" "Why alienate
Senators from both parties?" "What's the point in following a
lovefest?" "Who is going to listen?" are some of the comments I
received from law professors, citizen groups and civic leaders.

         Of course, responsibility for their lack of assertiveness is
on their shoulders, but it does seem that some deliberation is in
order by members of this Committee to take Senator Specter's
concerns and suggestions under advisement and also to project to
the public that more time for more listening will be taken, no
matter what the prospects are for the nominee. There is simply no
other widely covered forum for the American people to listen,
learn and contemplate the great constitutional questions that
affect their daily private and public lives and those of their
children than a confirmation hearing on a nomination to the
highest court in the land. The hearing itself is a national
asset.

         My focus today is on the necessity for balance in the way
our laws handle the challenges of corporate power in America. For
our political economy, no issue is more consequential than the
distribution and impact of corporate power. For Judge Breyer,
whose specialty is government regulation of business and
antitrust policy, corporate power provides a significant context
for evaluating his record, writings and activities.

         Historically, our country periodically has tried to redress
the imbalance between organized economic power and people rights
and remedies. From the agrarian populist revolt by the fanners in
the late 19th and early 20th century, to the rise of the federal
and state regulatory agencies, to the surging trade unionism, to
the opening of the courts for broader non-property values to have
                                 473

their day, to the strengthening of civil rights and civil
liberties, consumer, women's and environmental laws and
institutions, corporate power was partially disciplined by the
rule of law. There were years when the antitrust laws were
modestly enforced and when other fair trade rules were invocable.
There were years when the great common law expanded the
accountability of corporations whose products and pollutants
harmed innocent people and damaged their property.

         Starting in the late Seventies, many of these trends in
restraining, if not stopping, corporate crime, fraud, abuse and
predations slowed and, in many areas, were reversed. The
corporate counterattacks, fueled by the decline of organized
labor, the Reagan-Bush period of sharply reduced law and order
for corporations, the enhanced ability to achieve corporate ends
by threatening to move abroad, and the supremacy of business
money in campaigns sent the forces of law and order, of democracy
and decentralization, into retreat. In their place came the
corporate crime wave, often dutifully reported in the Wall Street
Journal news pages and documented by Congress, in the financial
and banking markets, the health care megafrauds, the defense
procurement debacles and the giant merger, acquisition and LBO
surge that created no new wealth or jobs but generated huge
profits for the few and huge debts for the companies. Widening
disparities in wealth and income between executives and workers
reflected the rampant avarice at the top and stagnant incomes
(adjusted for inflation) down the ladder for tens of millions of
Americans during the past 20 years or more.

         The Supreme Court mirrored this rightward drift toward those
who have power vis-a-vis those who do not. The present court is
still moving rightward with a distinct corporatist inclination.

         Justices Warren, Douglas, Brennan, Marshall and now Blackmun
are gone. Their judicial views, their quality of "heart" that
President Clinton seemed to desire in his nominees, have not been
replaced.

         Now comes Stephen G. Breyer, judge, writer, lecturer and
professor, who would like to be described as evenhanded,
impartial, objective, a consensus builder, a person who likes to
engage in "critiques of pure reason," to borrow Kant's phrase.
Upon his nomination. Judge Breyer stated that he wanted the law
to work "for ordinary people." But that "sensibility" is not what
practitioners in the business arena use to predict how their
                                 474

cases would likely emerge from Judge Breyer's pen. Nor do his
writings project a "for ordinary people" sensibility.

         Let one evaluate Judge Breyer most charitably, as he does
for corporations, by deleting motivation, intent and fault from
the equation. Let one start with him as a no-fault judge and look
at his record and how others perceive him.

         First the latter. There are serious reasons why the business
community, Wall Street Journal, ex-judge Bork, Lloyd Cutler,
Senators Dole, Thurmond and Hatch, and a host of conservative
commentators enthusiastically support the nominee. These reasons
relate, not to Judge Breyer's conventional views on civil rights
and civil liberties. They relate to his views regarding corporate
behavior, power and wealth. Judge Breyer is viewed as a
consistent judicial reassurance for the corporate status Q U O and
the bigger the corporations the better. He is viewed as
defending, sustaining and rationalizing the entrenched and
radiating impacts of corporate power vis-a-vis consumers, small
investors, workers, health and safety regulatory agencies and
other liability exposures. He is not new to them; they are not
being exposed to his record lately. He has been congenial to
their beliefs over a long period of time. This is not to say that
they expect 100 percent from him; just that they expect very few
fundamental surprises and lots of unsurprising networking on
their priority issues with other Justices.

         These corporate supporters may be wrong; certainly the
Democrats who are his friends and who have modest concerns
regarding corporate conduct believe the corporatists are reading
him wrong. I think those Democrats are mistaken for the following
reasons:

         1. Judge Brever and corporate economic power. His
sensibilities favor the powerful party to a judicial conflict
involving antitrust and other business litigation cases. Although
his opinions share much of the Chicago school view that the
antitrust laws should be interpreted by monetized minds on the
basis of short-term economic efficiency standards, bizarrely
defined, he does zig and zag more than those Partisans.
Nonetheless, his record of deciding for the corporate defendant
exceeds that of any other judge, Republican or Democrat, in all
the U.S. federal circuit courts of appeal.

         Depending on the scholarly assessment, he has ruled in favor
                                 475

of the corporate defendant 16 out of 16 times, 17 out of 19 times
or 19 out of 19 times if remands are seen for their pro-defendant
effect. Not even Judge Richard Posner has this record of
extremism. Yet Judge Breyer is called a moderate by his friends.

         It is apparent from his opinions that Judge Breyer neither
believes nor understands that the legislative history of the
Sherman and Clayton Antitrust laws reflects a deep concern in
Congress over the political, as well as economic, effects of
business concentration, monopolization and other anti-competitive
practices. Remember, those were the years when the term
"political economy" was wisely used to describe the dynamics of
economic behavior. Shorn of its legislative history -- a favorite
interest of Judge Breyer -- antitrust becomes susceptible to both
the mind games and word games of empirically starved theoretical
gymnastics. Business people whose victories in the lower federal
courts were overturned by the Judge are astonished at how remote
he seems from what actually goes on between the big and little
fish in the marketplace. Senator Metzenbaum has commented on this
remoteness by this school of antitrust ideology. (I have attached
to my testimony a short comment by University of Wisconsin Law
Professor Peter C. Carstensen on the "price-squeeze case," which
he believes has "greater significance for public policy in the
regulated industry area, especially telecommunications.")

         Such excessive abstraction tends to drain the dispute from
commercial or strategic intent by the accused defendant, takes a
short-term position on the effects of predatory pricing, price
discrimination, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance,
price squeezes and tying arrangements. These practices are viewed
as good for consumers, however destructive they may be to smaller
competitors or businesses on the losing end of vertical
restraints. During my discussion with Judge Breyer last summer,
he responded to my criticism of his decisions by saying, "Well
you are for small business and I am for the consumer." That
indeed is his regular response. I replied that freedom of
economic opportunity for small business is essential for the kind
of competition that benefits consumers, especially in the long
run. Washington, D.C. grocery shoppers would understand the
consequences, given the concentration of supermarkets in the
hands of Giant Foods and Safeway that has resulted in food prices
being about the highest of any urban area in the country.

         There have been other judges who have seen antitrust law
differently; they looked at market conduct, market structure and
                                  476

concentration ratios. In criminal and civil antitrust cases,
intent was not irrelevant.

         Donald Turner, Judge Breyer's antitrust mentor and employer
at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, co-authored
a widely heralded book in 1959 with economist Karl Kaysen, titled
Antitrust Policy. It contained a legislative proposal for
oligopoly-dissolution legislation. Market power was "conclusively
presumed where, for five years or more, one company has accounted
for 50 percent or more of annual sales in the market, or four or
fewer companies have accounted for 80 percent of sales."
Industries with sales volume below a minimum were not affected
and there were several defenses listed to rebut the presumption.

         In April 1966, as Antitrust Chief, Turner created a team
that established eight specific standards to test whether an
actionable shared monopoly existed and produced a list of
potential cases. That was the highwater mark before the Johnson
Administration, with few exceptions, heeded the demands of big
business to cease and desist. A massive attack on antitrust law
enforcement began in the Seventies with millions of dollars of
corporate-funded studies attacking its very foundations. The
Chicago School doctrines were taught at judges' seminars, funded
by business. Contrary views were excluded.

         When I asked Judge Breyer whether he agreed with the
Turner-Kaysen guidelines, he smiled and said, "That's a good
question," and he implied that Donald Turner himself, who
subsequently worked as a corporate defense attorney, may no
longer agree with them. The point of all this is that the great
questions of antitrust are no longer debated and studied. This
basic charter of the free enterprise system has fallen into limbo
beneath a counterattack on all fronts by global corporations and
their apologists who claim, with grotesque caricature, that the
antitrust laws interfere with U.S. global competitiveness. Now,
judges like Stephen G. Breyer are picking over its leftover
bones. Apart from overt price-fixing between competitors,
antitrust law has few interests for the anti-antitrusters. For
many of them, the prevailing view of market structure is
satisfied if there are only two companies left in a national
market, as Reagan's antitrust chief, William Baxter, asserted in
1981.

         Antitrust and its relevance to keeping our economy
deconcentrated and competitive has great meaning for diminishing
                                 477

corporate complacency, for jobs, for communities and the
political diversity that comes from economic diversity and
independent small business. It also has great relevance for
developing and marketing new technologies unsuppressed by
"product-fixing" and the fashionable joint ventures (as between
the auto companies) that are now routinely cleared and even
subsidized by the federal (taxpayer) government.

         Judge Breyer, in his decisions and writings, displays little
recognition of such antitrust values. His writings show no
interest in an aggregative analysis of the wealth of material
concerning concentration and anticompetitive practices in today's
economy of giantism and private trade restraints. This is too
bad, because presently the Supreme Court has little of the
familiarity with this subject that the nominee is said to
possess.

         The practical consequence of Judge Breyer rounding out the
Court on the subject of antitrust law for, perhaps, many years is
that without new legislation, antitrust law enforcement will sink
into a deeper moribund state, regardless of a very occasional
dutiful Antitrust Chief at the helm at Justice or the Federal
Trade Commission. This is especially-true in the area of large
mergers and joint ventures. Consider the rash of vertical and
horizonal gigantic mergers and acquisitions i'n the health-care
industry during the past year. Many of them would not even have
been tried in an atmosphere of modest antitrust law enforcement
as occurred in the Sixties and Seventies. If Senators are not
worried about such corporate concentration, Judge Breyer is their
man.

         2. Judge Brever's writings and the matter of law and order
for corporations. Judge Breyer has a unique zig-zag style, which
can be called confused unless one stays with the constant theme
that, at the end of the day, the result just happens to please
corporatists who do not welcome health and safety regulation. He
appears to seriously question many health and safety laws that he
will be expected to interpret impartially as a Justice of the
Supreme Court.

         Taken as a whole, his recent book, Breaking the Vicious
Circle, is a prescription for decisional paralysis, just as are
his stunningly selective sources in voluminous footnotes. Risks
are belittled, especially in the toxic area, while costs are
viewed in a tunnel vision of exaggeration and separation from
                                  478

what has actually happened. Alternatives such as materials
substitution (in aerosols, for example) or substance prohibition
(for example, lead in paint and gasoline) are ignored or
slighted. His reliance on many right-wing "think tanks" leads him
into regions of cost-benefit hysteria that would be comedic were
they not so tragically inimical to the victims of wrongful
injuries.

         Corporate cost estimates are taken as verities, people
benefits of a direct and indirect nature are minimized to absurd
levels. He pits tradeoffs of limited resources between funds for
child vaccination on the one hand, and toxics reduction on the
other, as if that is the relevant choice. His inter-modal
tradeoffs, if they quest for economizing, are curiously
restrictive, leaving out the massive portions of the federal
budgets devoted to corporate welfare programs and waste, fraud
and abuses in defense contracting (which produced its own
reckless pollution) and misspent health expenditures in the tens
of billions yearly. I have attached a paper titled "Could
Justice Breyer Be Hazardous to Your Health?" by University of
Texas School of Law Professor Thomas 0. McGarity, a friend of
Judge Breyer's and a critic of his views on health and
environmental regulation.

          Judge Breyer uses hypothetical slam-dunks, that have not
happened in the real world of government regulation of business,
to invite credibility for his arguments. Senators, how many times
has the federal government, much less industry, spent $20
million, $30 million, $100 million or $600 million to save an
American life? Perhaps in the space program for astronauts. The
government has declined to spend, or require to be spent, a few
dollars to save a motorist's life or an infant or child's life.
Whenever there are large expenditures, allegedly to save innocent
peoples' lives and restore large properties, a la Superfund, the
driving forces are contracts, whether seen as public works or
porkbarrel, for companies, consultants and other firms.

         By contrast, Congress in a close House vote in 1979 refused
to spend $15 million a year for a consumer protection office that
would make the regulatory agencies work better by advocacy and
judicial review. Imagine how the indentured regulatory agencies
might have been made more vigilant in the Eighties, while the S&L
financial looting was growing, or the Food and Drug
Administration was languishing, by a consumer protection office
                                 479

series of informed challenges. Lots of taxpayers' money could
have been saved there.

         Judge Breyer was skeptical about this consumer office, as he
is about the Congress, the courts, the liability laws and even
the agencies themselves of ever really improving the safety
regulatory process. One of his premises is that these agencies
err on the side of safety. Really? Instead, especially since
Reagan-Bush, these agencies have been sleeping on the side of the
regulatees. Can he have made any inquiry of what these agencies
do not do or how they do not act under their statutory mission?
Can he recognize the large numbers of deaths, injuries and other
morbidity year after year when the airbag rule and the lead
standard were tied in knots and blocked by their opponents? In a
verbal style that is typical of his mode of writing. Judge Breyer
knows when he is near the edge and then tries to disarm the
gaping reader. After suggesting that fuel efficiency standards
cost lives, that organic farming may produce more "natural
pesticides" than using artificial pesticides, that atomic energy
risks are marginal, that billions are spent on what he believes
are virtually zero-risk toxic situations, that very few cancer
deaths (less than 2 percent to 10 percent of all cancer deaths
and 7 percent to 33 percent of deaths associated with smoking)
*see[m] likely to be reduced by regulation," he writes on page
28:

          "In considering my examples, you must remember several
          important caveats. These examples are selective; they focus
          on extremes. They leave out the far more numerous examples
          of balanced, sensible, and cost-effective regulations*
           (emphasis added).

          How strange! We hear virtually nothing about these "far more
 numerous examples" in his book or other writings. Indeed, in a
 book chapter on the National Highway Traffic Safety
 Administration (NHTSA) published in 1982, he goes out of his way
 to ignore the successes of that body during the short period when
 it was headed by people who believed in the agency's life-saving
 mission and were not undermined by White House operatives. Mr.
 Breyer, by the way, gives little weight to the beneficial effect
 of appointing good people to these agencies and backing them up
 at higher levels within the Administration. Attached is a
 critique questioning Judge Breyer's scholarship on NHTSA in his
 1982 book titled Regulation and Its Reform, by Clarence Ditlow,
 director of the Center for Auto Safety, and Joan Claybrook,
 President of Public Citizen and former NHTSA Administrator.
                                  480

         Repeatedly, Judge Breyer cites the likes of Viscusi, Huber,
the Cato Institute, the Manhattan Institute, Peltzman, Graham,
Lave and other charter members of the "pitiless abstraction*
crowd whom the Fortune 500 love to cite. For example, Sam
Peltzman once wrote an incomplete article declaring that safer
designed cars kill more people because drivers, feeling more
secure, take more chances. I say incomplete because he did not
reach his logical conclusion, which would have been to recommend
that sharp spear-like hubs in steering wheels emanating toward
drivers be installed to induce greater care by those steering the
vehicles.

         Curiously, Judge Breyer does not cite the Union of Concerned
Scientists, many technical government and Congressional reports,
the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense
Fund, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the World
Resources Institute, World Watch, or a host of scholarly
researchers and specialists who might undermine his abstract
thoughts and empirically deprived observations. Is this the sign
of a moderate, an impartial analyst? Imagine suggesting, as he
did in 1982, that expenditures for vehicle head restraints be
replaced with automatic flashing lights when vehicles are
travelling over 60 mph, a pinball-machine idea that does little
to prevent head injuries in the far more frequent rear-end
collisions below 60 mph.

         More interesting is his reluctance to put his mind to work
on designing an improvement in the nation's regulatory process
(broadly defined) on any risk that he does think serious -- for
instance, casualties from smoking the products of the tobacco
industry. The reader begins to eagerly anticipate how Judge
Breyer, the publicized creative problem-solver and
consensus-builder, would have society's laws deal with a scourge
that takes over 400,000 American lives a year. As a one-time San
Francisco lawyer for a tobacco company, his brother, Charles
Breyer, could provide him with whatever informational and
stimulatory effects have flowed from product liability cases
against the tobacco industry. Alas, such an intellectual repast
was denied the reader, leaving a feeling that the Judge's mind
may work most vigorously to destroy regulatory paradigms for
corporate accountability rather than build them.

         To illustrate how Judge Breyer's line of thought, or shall
they be called musings, can reach levels of intellectual
dilettantism, on page 23 of the Vicious Circle book, he writes,
                                  481

with minimum restraint, that "At all times regulation imposes
costs that mean less real income available to individuals for
alternative expenditure. That deprivation of real income itself
has adverse health effects, in the form of poorer diet, more

heart attacks, more suicides" (emphasis added). What he is
referring to are "academic studies" that argue that when
companies assume regulatory costs, they take it out of worker
wages or in worker layoffs (not from shareholders or waste or
redesigning products). These workers, it is asserted, mistreat
themselves by smoking more, drinking more or not eating well. At
all times. Judge Breyer says, regulation imposes costs that
reduce real income. That is such a sweeping extremist statement,
belied by the illustration of contaminated foods, defective
vehicles and unsafe toys being taken off the market that saved
the companies' reputations from being harmed further. Or
prohibiting vinyl chloride in some products and requiring sharply
reduced levels in workplaces actually stimulated substantial
productivities and no jobs were lost and fewer cancers resulted.
Companies admitted their industry's original cost-estimate for
compliance was grossly exaggerated.

         Dow Chemical has spoken about economies stimulated by
regulation (eg. curbs on mercury dumping). Blocking the use of
thalidomide in the United States by the FDA certainly saved
infants from disfigurement and that probably saved some companies
from near-bankruptcy. There are more fundamental rejections of
such an absolutist statement which can be made at a later time.
Suffice it to say that airbags now employ workers who produce
them, and reduce costs of auto insurance, health care, wage
losses and other would-be consequences of non-airbag
crash-injuries. Funeral directors, however, do suffer a loss of
income, to give Judge Breyer some due.

         Later on that page, he cites studies that suggest "many
concrete possibilities for obtaining increased health, safety and
environmental benefits through reallocation of regulatory
resources." These include "advertising the cancer-causing
potential of sunbathing, indoor smoke and pollution, and radon
and subsidizing the creation of healthier indoor climates;
encouraging changes in diet to avoid natural carcinogens. ...
[etc.]" The great majority of items on this list involve
post-corporate regulatory actions and taxpayer subsidies rather
than, where yppliiCfl*?!*?- using the regulatory tools for prevention
before the hazards proceed from the companies to workplace, to
market, to environment or to household. Surprisingly, Judge
                               482

Breyer combines an intriguing disinterest in prevention-oriented
regulatory policies that change corporate behavior, with a
studied avoidance of using cost-benefit tests for his above-
mentioned "alternatives."

         Epidemiologists and safety engineers alike have long known
that prevention at the earliest point of onset is the most
effective, least costly choice of strategies. Prevention by
regulation is far preferable to regulation after the hazards are
at large. Which recalls the adage that "an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure." The trouble for Judge Breyer's construct
here is that prevention often starts at the door of the company
where his proposals usually stop. This is unfortunate, because
training his mind on the way the corporate charter, the
constitutional issues of corporate personhood, and the internal
corporate structure and its external constituencies can
contribute to superior performances in the management of
industrial violence and risk might have advanced the very
objectives he claims to seek much more efficiently and humanely.

         3. Judge Brever and the issue of democratic public
participation. It is his lack of confidence in "greater public
participation" leading to real improvements in the problems of
health and safety regulation that gives this observer the
greatest pause about not just Judge Breyer's philosophy but his
understanding of the historical efficacy of broader and deeper
democracy. It is a premise of democracy that those who are
affected by government should participate, if they choose, in its
proceedings without mischievous and costly obstructions. More and
more aggrieved parents -- some starting safety institutions --
have alerted or persuaded regulatory agencies to act. Citizens
have exposed, sensitized these agencies and sometimes pressed
Congress to create these safety and health regulatory programs as
a systematic approach to living in a safer and more healthful
America.

          Procedural proposals for wider public participation have
included broader standing rights before these agencies, modest
intervenor expense funding for impecunious groups (tried
successfully in the late Seventies at the Federal Trade
Commission), more fulsome information and notice rights about
agency actions, allowance of citizen suits to mandate actions --
to name a few ways that can facilitate the involved energies of
citizens.
                                 483

         Judge Breyer's position is that while the general notion of
public participation may be well and good, it won't adequately
address the challenge of better government. Instead of opening
the lighted highways of democracy for the people to shape and
improve their governments' health and safety agencies, Judge
Breyer believes in his proposal for a new prestigious, executive
corps of authoritative, skilled civil servants be established
from on high to rationalize the agencies' work internally and
between each other. As described and analogized to an OMB office
and the French Conseil d'Etat, this proposed unit seems
autocratic, secretive and outside the lighted highways.

         Given the experience of the Office of Management and Budget
in becoming a supra-agency with some of these same coordinating
missions, the process did become more secretive, more remote from
public dockets and commentary and more like another paralytic
layer of bureaucracy. Reagan's OMB also became corrupt with
rampant ex parte contacts. The process did become much more adept
at stopping just about all agency safety standards actions, under
Reagan and Bush, than starting any lifesaving endeavor or
approving one already underway. "Cost-benefit" conclusions under
Reagan's OMB, using the usual rigged formulas, very rarely
supported issuance of a health or safety standard. It even found
 the automobile passive-restraint standard to be not cost-
beneficial, until the Administration was overruled by a unanimous
 Supreme Court.

          Why this lack of confidence by Judge Breyer in perfecting
 the democratic process? How will his top-down "mandarin"
philosophy deal with the public access issues that will come
be'fore the Court in so many modes -- from old-fashioned ways to
such new ideas as the one rejected by a vote of 5 to 3 (Rehnquist
dissenting) involving a California rule requiring invitational
inserts, at no cost to the utility, to be placed in the utility's
billing envelopes inviting residential ratepayers to join and
fund their own statewide consumer group? Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. v. Public Utilities Commission. 475 U.S. 1 (1986).

          How will he handle the access issues posed by the new
telecommunications technologies with his very modest regard for
the efficacy of strengthening our democratic engagement rights
and facilities? I would like to place in the published hearing
record, Mr. Chairman, a series of questions that Harvard Law
Professor Richard Parker, a colleague of Judge Breyer's, believes
could focus attention on the extent to which the nominee
                                 484

interprets the First Amendment "as more than a right of ordinary
people to read or hear speech" and whether "it demands that they
be empowered to participate effectively in speech themselves."

         Most analysts, from all spectra, believe that the regulatory
process needs serious improvements. Our work over the past 25
years has devoted considerable energies to such improvements,
advocating the end of cartel regulation in transport modes and
proposing ways that make health and safety agencies mindful of
their mission with the best approaches to achieve their statutory
objectives. When Judge Breyer argues strongly against "the
hopeful position that more direct 'democratic' public involvement
will automatically lead to better results," he deprives himself
of thinking about many creative ways to always improve the
effectiveness of such public involvement in a working practical
democracy.

         He also thoroughly ignores the crushingly obstructive roles
that corporate regulatees and their allies play to delay, dilute,
fissure or shut down regulatory lifesaving efforts far beyond
their legitimate right to plead and petition. These corporate
roles are not restricted to artful uses of the Administrative
Procedure Act and other regulatory maneuvers. Corporations go to
the sources -- prevent the activities by Congressional lobbying,
fund political campaigns and when the elections are over, make
sure that the sympathetic appointments are made to anesthetize
the agency. Reagan's NHTSA head, a coal lawyer by the name of
Raymond Peck, made little secret that his mission was to
dismantle the agency without closing it. His boss,
Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, told an auto dealer
convention in early 1981 that he didn't want to issue any safety
standards during his tenure. He missed his goal by one, but that
was countered by rescinding other standards. Other agencies,
such as EPA, FDA and FAA, had similar leaders.

         Judge Breyer simply does not factor these relentless, daily
pressures by regulatees, their trade associations and corporate
lawyers on the regulatory process. There seems in his mind to be
no continuing, serious link between these corporate interest
groups and some of the deficiencies that he attaches to these
agencies. (He does not even have entries for "corporation,"
"business" or "company" in the indices to his two books on
government regulation of business!) Yet everybody in the real
world of Washington, D.C. must agree that corporations are major
players, major factors in the maelstrom of power and decision
                                 485

around and in these agencies. Nonetheless, we have one of these
agencies' main analysts -- the nominee -- who relegates them to a
neuter, anonymous status. This neglect simply is not good
scholarship and accounts for the excessive abstraction and
remoteness of his treatments.

         Consider, by comparison, the empirical awareness of the
Supreme Court of the United States in a case involving the airbag
safety system under Standard 208. The unanimous opinion in 1983
by Justice White displayed an attentiveness to the industrial
power reality, which obstructed and delayed a regulatory agency's
mission, that Judge Breyer would do well to ponder. The Court
wrote:

         The automobile industry has opted for the passive belt over
         the airbag, but surely it is not enough that the regulated
         industry has eschewed a given safety device. For nearly a
         decade, the automobile industry waged the regulatory
         equivalent of war against the airbag and lost -- the
         inflatable restraint was proven sufficiently effective. Now
         the automobile industry has decided to employ a seatbelt
         system which will not meet the safety objectives of Standard
         208. This hardly constitutes cause to revoke the standard
         itself. Indeed, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act was necessary
         because the industry was not sufficiently responsive to
         safety concerns. The Act intended that safety standards not
         depend on current technology and could be "technology-
         forcing" |in the sense of inducing the development of
         superior isafety design. See Chrysler Corp. v. Dept. of
         Transp. 4J72 F. 2d, at 672-673. If, under the statute, the
         agency should not defer to the industry's failure to develop
         safer caifs, which it surely should not do, a fortiori it may
         not revoke a safety standard which can be satisfied by
         current technology simply because the industry has opted for
         an ineffective seatbelt design." Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
         Association of the United States, Inc. et. al. v. State Farm
         Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. et. al.. 463 U.S. 29, 49
          (1983) . '

         In conclusion, I wish that Judge Breyer were more pragmatic
when it came to thinking about democratic public participation.
I wish that he were more empirical when thinking about the many
elements of corporate power, structure and behavior. I wish that
he were more realistic when he discusses risks, costs,
alternatives and technical sources for his writings and
judgments. I wish he would think deeply about corporate status
                                  486

and the Constitution as developed between 1886 (Santa Clara v.
Southern Pacific Railroad Co. 118 U.S. 394) and 1986 (Pacific Gas
and Electric Company v. Public Utility Commission of California
475 U.S. 1) to see what limits there should be to the personhood
of the corporate entity.

        It is disappointing that President Clinton chose not to
nominate a person to the Supreme Court who combined learning,
experience, wisdom and compassion with a proven record over time
of putting people first under the law. Unfortunately, the people
are left only with the hope that, should he be confirmed instead
of rejected, a transformation, nourished a little by these
hearings, will occur to make Justice Breyer different from Judge
Breyer.

        Hope, as it is written, springs eternal.

        Thank you.

                               Judge Breyer and the Price Squeeze Problem
           (Town of Concord, Mass. v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990)

                                                                                                  Peter C. Carstensen

                                                                            University of Wisconsin Law School

         Judge Brevet's decision in Town of Concord, Mass. v. Boston Edison, complete with two
academic appendices, is a classic example of using abstract economic theory to deny or override
factual realities. While I can not say that the ultimate holding in the case was necessarily wrong,
it is very clear that the approach adopted is antithetical to a reasoned, fact based inquiry into what
are in real world terms very difficult and complex legal-economic questions. This is even more
troubling because the decision has the effect of empowering large and dominant utilities to
engage in anticompetitive, strategic regulatory behavior. In an era of large scale deregulation,
especially in the telecommunications area, Judge Breyer has repeated the error that he made as a
staff advisor to Senator Kennedy in preparing the airline deregulation legislation: he has assumed
despite generations of real world experience to the contrary that business's will not seek and
exploit strategic opportunities to gain unjustified competitive advantage. Only strict but
thoughtful antitrust review can police such market conduct and ensure that the nominally
competitive market is competitive in practice so that consumers gain the theoretically predicted
advantages.

         The facts of the Concord case appear to be that Concord and another locality had
municipally owned, local power systems. These systems purchased the bulk of their power from
Boston Edison at a wholesale rate. Boston Edison also provided retail power service in a number
of adjacent communities. Boston Edison convinced the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) that its costs of producing power had increased and so its wholesale rates (the prices
charged to the independent distribution systems like Concord that retailed power) should go up.
However, Boston Edison did not ask the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities for an
increase in its own retail rates for the service it provided in 39 adjacent towns. In consequence,
Concord found that while it had to raise its retail rates, retail customers in the adjacent
communities faced no comparable price increase. Such a "price squeeze" would directly affect
Concord's ability to compete for new customers that used substantial amounts of electricity. In
                                      488

 addition (this is perhaps the greater competitive evil), the lesson for communities using Boston
 Edison's service is that retail prices would go up in any community that sought to take control
 over its own local electric service.

          Although Concord satisfied a jury and trial judge that the price squeeze existed and that
 its purpose was to harm the competitive capacity of the towns being squeezed, Judge Breyer
 writing for a three judge panel rejected the verdict and ordered the case dismissed. The decision
 rests on two conclusions: first, that the antitrust laws should not generally be used to condemn
 price squeezes engaged in by monopolists if both levels of price are subject to direct regulation.
 Second, the Court concluded that Boston Edison lacked monopoly power in the business of
supplying electricity and so the predicate monopoly power necessary for any fmding of illegality
was missing. This second conclusion makes the entire discussion of the merits of the conduct
unnecessary for the result in the case. One can not help but wonder why Judge Breyer undertook
such a lengthy (8+ pages compared to only 3 for the legally controlling issue) analysis of the
price squeeze issue which advances several controversial positions when a second issue was
controlling in any event'

         Judge Breyer starts his analysis of price squeezes by arguing that the competitive risks of
such conduct have been exaggerated and the potential efficiency gains largely ignored in contexts
outside those presented by regulated industries His proof consists of citations to the Areeda and
Turner treatise on antitrust law, a dissenting opinion by Judge Easterbrook, one of the most
persistent users of economic theory to deny the reality of business experience, and a quotation
from a Supreme Court decision that had nothing to do with price squeezes. This is hardly an
overpowering array of support for the proposition that price squeezes are not generally a serious
threat to competition. This conclusion is then linked with the more plausible contention that
determining the facts about a purported price squeeze is a difficult judicial task. The
combination of arguments in turn justifies a negative attitude toward price squeezes as potential

         1 The monopoly power analysis is questionable on its own merits and was applied in the
case in a way that ignored the potential of an attempt to monopolize claim that might have been a
more relevant way to evaluate the jury's ultimate decision. In order not to unduly lengthen this
discussion, I will focus only on the price squeeze issue which represents the most troublesome
aspect of the case as a precedent restricting antitrust review of strategic conduct in regulated
industries
                                     489

antitrust violations. While repeatedly asserting that the opinion does not "question that
conclusion... " (p. 23), the implication is that Judge Breyer is very skeptical that any price
squeeze occurs except for legitimate business reasons. Indeed, Judge Breyer might be on
stronger ground with respect to unregulated markets where entry and exit can occur without
lengthy administrative processes.

         The second stage of the argument against price squeezes is the more remarkable. Without
any examination or recognition of the lengthy, well worked out theories of how regulatory
processes can be and are used strategically to harm consumer and other public interests, Judge
Breyer starts from the naive assumption that regulation is done in the public interest. Hence he
asserts that "regulation significantly diminishes the likelihood of major antitrust harm." (at 25)
He then advances a simple proposition: when both levels of price are subject to direct regulation
there should be little or no risk of anticompetitive exploitation of price.

         Indeed, if a SINGLE, well-motivated regulator controlled both levels, such a presumption
might seem plausible on its face. But in this, and as far as I have seen all comparable cases, the
key and central regulatory fact is that DIFFERENT REGULATORS CONTROL PRICES AT
THE TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS. Thus, FERC only controlled Boston Edison's wholesale
price while the Massachusetts regulator alone controlled its retail prices. This regulatory division
creates an obvious opportunity to manipulate the retail-wholesale difference in strategic ways.
The integrated company can shift costs to wholesale customers (who also compete for new retail
business) while not igniting a fire storm of local opposition because no application is made to the
state authorities to increase retail prices (who else is going to force up retail prices to reflect the
new, higher nominal wholesale price?). Unlike some predatory practices, this squeeze results in
shifting costs to the competitor which enhances the profits of the dominant firm while penalizing
the other firm. According to antitrust history, John D. Rockefeller got the railroads to pay rebates
to Standard Oil based on the volume of oil shipped by its competitors (thus both lowering
Standard's costs and raising those of its rivals); yet Judge Breyer is both unaware of the analogy
and insensitive to the manifest competitive risks that dual regulation presents in this case.

         Indeed, not one word in the opinion addresses the tension that necessarily exists when
two regulators share authority over the final price to consumers and are not required to
                                     490

coordinate their actions. Such a situation, where the mandated prices must be charged as a
matter of legal requirement, creates a particularly attractive opportunity for strategic behavior
that can shift costs, deter existing competition, and retard the incentives for new entry of locally
owned retail distribution systems. Yet Judge Breyer, a man who made his reputation as a scholar
by writing about the problems of effective regulation, does not even acknowledge the issue.
Instead, he uses general concerns about how antitrust review might disrupt public interested,
regulatory efficiency to validate further his preference for ignoring the competitive risks
involved. A similar inability to see the risks inherent in airline deregulation (a project in which
Judge Breyer played an important role as a staffer for Senator Kennedy) caused that legislation to
become law without the necessary protections against anticompetitive mergers and conduct.

         The spirit of the Concord decision is close to that of Justice Scalia in Business
Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp, 485 U.S. 717 (1988). In that decision, Scalia
claimed that economic theory established that vertical restraints not directly controlling prices
could have no anticompetitive effect despite thousands of real world examples to the contrary.
The better approach is that eloquently articulated by Justice Blackmun, whom Judge Breyer is to
replace, in the recent decision of Eastman Kodak v. Image Technical Services, Inc. U.S._, 112
S.Ct 2072 (1992). Justice Blackmun used economic theories to assist in evaluating the particular
facts of the case. Theories were rejected if they could not explain the facts rather than the other
way around.

         The Concord decision is particularly troubling because it refuses an antitrust review in a
context of regulatory conflict and uncertainty. It invokes sweeping theories having little
empirical support and no particular relevance to the specific factual context. As the states and
the federal government move toward more competitive public utilities, we need the spirit of
Blackmun with his concern for understanding the competitive realities and not another Scalia
type theorist who, having imagined a pro-competitive explanation, ignores the record and the
context to refuse a focused antitrust evaluation of the merits of the conduct at issue.

        Now that prominent representatives of both ends of the political spectrum have
enthusiastically endorsed President Clinton's nomination of Judge Stephen Breyer to
the Supreme Court, most knowledgeable observers predict a speedy confirmation
process at the end of which the Senate will consent without providing very much
advice. Before jumping on the Breyer bandwagon, however, the Senate should pay
some attention to what Judge Breyer has been saying about a rather arcane topic that
is nevertheless of great concern to the general public -- federal regulation of activities
that pose risks to human health and the environment. An examination of Judge
Breyer's views on health and environmental regulation reveals that he is not likely to
disappoint conservative critics of the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA). Before the confirmation process has run its hasty course, the
Senate Judiciary Committee should pause to ask whether Justice Breyer could be
hazardous to the public health.

                                 Judge Brever's Background.

        Judge Breyer has extensive experience in public policymaking. After
graduating from Harvard Law School and serving a clerkship with Justice Arthur
Goldberg, he worked briefly for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. In 1967,
Breyer joined the faculty of the Harvard Law School to teach courses on
                                       492

Administrative Law and Antitrust Law. He returned to Washington, D.C. several
times during the next thirteen years to work for the Watergate Special Prosecutor and
on two separate occasions for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his early
teaching years, Professor Breyer gained a national reputation as an expert on federal
regulation of natural gas. In the midst of the energy crisis, Judge Breyer and Paul
MacAvoy, a well-regarded Harvard economist, co-authored a short book questioning
the existing framework for regulating natural gas and urging rapid deregulation.1
Although the book was a little ahead of its time, Congress later passed the Natural Gas
Policy Act of 1978,2 which to a large extent adopted the policy prescriptions of
Breyer, MacAvoy and other critics of natural gas regulation.

         Judge Breyer next broadened his intellectual horizons to encompass all federal
regulation of private activity. In the late 1970s, he became a consultant to the
American Bar Association's newly created Commission on Law and the Economy to
help in drafting a report on federal regulation and its impact on the American
economy. The Commission's Report, entitled Federal Regulation: Roads to Reform,
proved very influential in the congressional debates over "regulatory reform" in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.3 The Report adopted an impressively sophisticated
taxonomy of regulation that Professor Breyer later elaborated upon in an article in the

Commission (1973).

Harvard Law Review1 and in a subsequent book of about the same length entitled
Regulation and its Reform.2

         Soon after penning the regulatory reform article. Professor Breyer left Harvard
to become Chief Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was at that time
considering legislation designed to bring about important changes in economic
regulation. During his brief stint with the Committee, Breyer was instrumental in
drafting legislation deregulating the airlines. Impressed with his staff work. Senator
Kennedy persuaded President Carter to nominate Breyer to a vacant position on the
First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. The nomination languished until after the
1980 election, after which the Senate (for which the Republican Party was soon to be
the majority party) confirmed only one of the many Carter nominations to the bench.
The single appointment was that of Judge Breyer. Senate Republicans were apparently
sufficiently comfortable with Judge Breyer's views that they elected not to stall the
nomination for the few weeks that would have been necessary to allow newly elected
President Reagan to withdraw it.

         Once on the bench, Judge Breyer did not abandon his interest in federal
regulation. Although the First Circuit does not have many opportunities to review
actions of federal regulatory agencies, Judge Breyer has continued to teach and write
scholarly articles and books on Administrative and Environmental Law. His most
recent book, entitled Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Effective Risk Regulation?

contains Judge Breyer's current thinking on federal regulation of toxic chemicals in
the workplace and the environment. A close look at this book and some of Judge
Breyer's earlier writing on the role that courts should play in reviewing the actions of
federal regulatory agencies should help answer the question whether Justice Breyer
could be hazardous to the public health.

                           Judge Breyer's Laissez Fair* Presumption.

         One clear theme that emerges from Judge Breyer's writings is his strong
preference for the free market and his corresponding skepticism about the efficacy of
governmental intervention into private market arrangements. For example, the
framework for analysis of federal regulation that Professor Breyer developed in the
late 1970s "assume[d] that the unregulated marketplace is the norm and that those who
advocate governmental intervention must justify it by showing that it is needed to
achieve an important public objective that an unregulated marketplace cannot
provide."' In this important respect, Judge Breyer's views parallel those of prominent
judicial appointees of President Reagan, including Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Alex
Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit, Judges Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner of the
Seventh Circuit, Judges Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsberg of the D.C. Circuit,
and former Judge Robert Bork. Indeed, this presumption against government
intervention into private economic arrangements is nothing new; it is merely a

          Analyzing Regulatory Failure, supra,, at 552.
                                    495

somewhat subdued reinvocation of the principles of laissez faire, caveat emptor,
volenti nonfit injuria, and other related doctrines that formed the foundation for the
legislative and judicial regime of the late nineteenth century that was thoroughly
discredited during the Progressive and New Deal eras.

          It is certainly possible that Judge Breyer is less hesitant than some of his more
conservative brethren to allow the presumption to be rebutted. He does, for example,
recognize certain traditional explanations for why "market failure" can justify
governmental intervention. Thus, the presence of "externalities" or "spillovers" can
justify environmental regulation, and occupational safety regulation may be necessary
to correct for inadequate information.1 Still, it is clear that he is no fan of health and
environmental regulation. The pathbreaking aspect of his early work on regulatory
reform was its recognition that just as market failures sometimes justify regulation,
"regulatory failures" sometimes justify regulatory reform. According to Breyer,
regulatory failures most often result from "mismatches" between the justifications for
regulation and the regulatory tools that the government adopts.2 He suggests that
policymakers look for alternative regulatory tools that better match the nature of the
market failure that gave rise to the need for regulation. In the case of health and
environmental regulation, Breyer strongly urges agencies to pay more attention to
private bargaining and incentives, such as effluent fees and marketable permits, rather
than continuing to focus on traditional standard setting,3 even though such market-

oriented techniques have rarely been tested in the real world.1
        In Breaking the Vicious Circle, Judge Breyer, much more clearly than in his

previous work, demonstrates a willingness to allow health and safety proponents to
rebut the laissez faire presumption. Yet although he concedes that health and
environmental regulation is necessary to reduce the risks posed by toxic chemicals in
the environment, he nearly always minimizes the magnitude of those risks. In his
usual deliberative fashion, Judge Breyer addresses the ongoing debate in the scientific
community over how to assess the magnitude of health risks posed by exposure to
environmental contaminants. Some scientists believe that a relatively large percentage
of human cancers are caused by exposure to man-made toxic chemicals; others believe
that the percentage is so small as to warrant little societal attention. Some scientists
believe that high-dose animal testing is the most practical way to screen chemicals for
carcinogenicity; others believe that animal tests are not sufficiently reliable to serve as
the basis for regulatory action. Unfortunately, in describing health and environmental
risks, Judge Breyer relies almost exclusively upon the scientists on one side of the
debate, relegating the scientists on the other side to a judicious "but see" citation at the
end of a footnote. In short, Judge Breyer takes sides in the debate, and he sides with
those that believe that the risks posed by environmental contaminants are not very
large.

        This leads Judge Breyer to conclude that environmental activists and the media
have steered a naive Congress into creating a precautionary regulatory atmosphere in

Uniform Standards and "Fine-Tuning" Regulatory Reforms, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1267, 1275-
84 (1985); Thomas O. McGarity, Substantive and Procedural Discretion in Administrative

which federal agencies force well-meaning companies to waste scarce resources trying
to reduce or eliminate the "last ten percent" of the risks posed by environmental
contaminants. Relying upon his own experience in reviewing the record in the Ottati
& Goss case,1 Judge Breyer questions whether it would be worth spending $9.3
million to protect children who might at some time in the future eat some of the
contaminated dirt that would otherwise be left in place at a notorious New Hampshire
superfund site.2 In a similar vein, Judge Breyer critiques EPA's attempts to regulate
asbestos and OSHA's and EPA's attempts to regulate benzene.3 In each instance,
Judge Breyer accepts the opinions of the experts that trivialize the risks that the
government was attempting to address and rejects experts that take them seriously.
Judge Breyer therefore concludes in each case that the government was attempting to
force private companies to pay too much to reduce minimal health risks.

         If one believes the experts that Judge Breyer cites, many of whom either work
for or are supported financially by the regulated industries, it is easy to agree with his
analysis. A company should not be required to spend tens of millions of dollars to
save a small fraction of a single statistical life. The experts that Judge Breyer relies
upon, however, are inclined to gloss over the enormous uncertainties that becloud any
attempt to quantify the risks posed by chemicals in the environment. If one is less
inclined than Judge Breyer to trust these experts to assess risks accurately, one might
insist that companies be required to undertake their best efforts to reduce emissions or

to clean up old messes, even when the resulting benefits are not precisely quantifiable.
         Much depends upon how much risk lies in the last ten percent that, according

to Judge Breyer, should not generally be of great concern to society. Unfortunately,
attempts to answer that question are confounded by huge uncertainties. Because
testing toxic chemicals in human beings in controlled experiments is ethically
questionable, scientists attempt to identify subpopulations (often workers) who have
received larger exposures that the general population. These after-the-fact
epidemiology studies can identify substances, like asbestos and vinyl chloride, that
have powerful toxic effects. Less striking, but still significant, effects get lost in the
statistical noise. As the apparently never ending debate over the health effects of
smoking makes clear, even the studies that show a positive correlation between
exposure and disease are fiercely debated among well-credentialed scientists. Risk
predictions based upon such studies are at best highly debatable, and not appropriately
cited as gospel.

         In the absence of good epidemiological studies, government agencies have for
decades relied upon tests in rodent species to predict potential health effects in
humans. For economic reasons, the tests are carried out at doses much higher than
typical human exposures in the environment. Sadly, the scientists who examine under
a microscope the tissues from the animals cannot always agree about what they see.
Some pathologists see cancer where others see only dead tissue. Animal testing also
gives rise to uncertainties over the relevance of animal studies to humans and over the
proper mechanism for extrapolating the high exposure results to the low exposures that
humans typically experience. Risk predictions can vary over several orders of
magnitude, depending upon which mathematical model one chooses.1

     1 For extended discussions of the uncertainties that regulators encounter in
conducting health risk assessments, see National Research Council, Risk Assessment in
the Federal Government: Managing the Process (1983); James Leape, Quantitative Risk

         Swimming in this sea of uncertainties, the regulatory decisionmaker must rely
upon presumptions to fill in the factual gaps. Guided by their respective statutes,
federal agencies have in the past tended to "err on the side of safety" in resolving the
science/policy disputes that produce the uncertainties. It is precisely on this point that
Judge Breyer parts company with this mainstream public policy toward regulating
health and environmental risks. Although he clearly understands the regulator's
dilemma, Judge Breyer flatly rejects a policy of erring on the side of safety in dealing
with the uncertainties that arise our of these science/policy disputes, because it leads
society to spend too many dollars chasing after what he believes to be trivial risks.1

         This is the essence of a contentious policy debate over health and
environmental regulation in the United States. For the most part, the American public
and its elected representatives have adopted a policy of erring on the side of safety.
They recognize that sometimes this policy will lead to actions being taken with respect
to chemicals that do not pose very high risks, but the presumption will also help avoid
disasters like thalidomide, Bnopal and Chernobyl. Persuaded by the experts on one
side of the debate that tend to trivialize most health and environmental risks. Judge
Breyer does not believe that the uncertainties are so large or the consequences of error
so terrible that society should replace the presumption in favor of free markets with
one that errs on the side of safety.

          Judge Breyer also believes that Congress, the regulatory agencies and the

public cannot be trusted to address risk regulation in a sensible way. Relying on
highly suspect comparisons of environmental risks with other safety risks that human
beings routinely encounter, Breyer concludes that the risk perceptions of ordinary folks
depart dramatically from the real risks as determined by the experts.' If the experts
are right (and Judge Breyer rather uncritically assumes that they are), the public must
be wrong in clamoring for more protection from environmental contamination. Nor
does Judge Breyer trust Congress to regulate risks intelligently. He is especially
critical of absolutist statutory provisions like the Delaney Clause, which prohibits the
deliberate addition of animal carcinogens to food. He believes that "Congress is not
institutionally well suited to write detailed regulatory instructions that will work
effectively."2 In fact, Judge Breyer does not really trust the regulatory agencies to get
it right, because they cannot be trusted to "resist Congressional or public efforts to set
agendas and to manage particular results."3

         Like many industry and academic critics of health and environmental
regulation, Judge Breyer argues that the money expended complying with
"unreasonable" health and environmental regulations could more effectively be spent
addressing different health and environmental risks. For example, he suggests that
much of the money expended on cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste dumps in the
United States would be better spent saving the trees in Madagascar. In addition to
relying upon dubious quantitative risk comparisons, such "wishful thinking" arguments

                                       501

presume the existence of institutional vehicles for directing private resources from one
private use to entirely unrelated public uses. Judge Breyer's example presumes a
vehicle for collecting monies from hazardous waste generators, a vehicle for directing
those resources to Madagascar, and a vehicle for ensuring that they are spent on
saving trees, presumably by compensating the owners of those trees. Imagine the
reception in Congress of a Bill the intent of which was to shift wealth from
manufactures and municipalities in United States to large land holders in Madagascar.
Since the government is powerless to save the trees in Madagascar, the argument that
the money spent cleaning up hazardous waste dumps could be better spent in
Madagascar is in reality an argument for doing nothing at all.

         Judge Breyer even accepts the highly dubious "richer is safer" argument against
stringent regulation of activities that pose health and safety risks. This theory, which
has few adherents in the academic community, posits that health and environmental
regulation can harm human health through the adverse impact that it has on the
economy. Breyer approvingly cites one estimate that "every $7.25 million spent on a
cleanup regulation will, under certain assumptions, induce one additional fatality"1 for
the proposition that regulations that cost more than that amount per statistical life
saved are counterproductive. The "certain assumptions" alluded to are for the most
part entirely lacking in empirical support. They include the assumption that the
money that employers save from not having to comply with strict OSHA standards
will be passed on to workers, rather than shareholders, and the assumption that
workers will spend that extra money on better diets, rather than cigarettes, and on less
stressful leisure, rather than on jet-skiing or bungie-jumping. It is hard not to

     1 Vicious Circle, supra, at 23.
                                    502

conclude that this argument is merely a conscience-salving makeweight to justify an
antiregulatory posture arrived at on other grounds.

        In sum, Judge Breyer has after much study formed fairly strong opinions about
the need for and efficacy of federal health and environmental regulation. In his mind,
the burden of justifying such regulation is on the would-be beneficiaries of such
regulation, and they should be prepared to demonstrate not only that regulation will
reduce health and environmental risks, but also that the money expended in doing so
could not better be spent reducing some other risks. It seems reasonably clear that if
Judge Breyer had been a member of Congress, be would not have supported many of
the current health and environmental statutes. But Judge Breyer is not running for
Congress; he has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court cannot enact or repeal legislation, but it can profoundly affect how
regulatory agencies implement congressional enactments. Therefore, to answer the
question whether Justice Breyer would be hazardous to the public health, we must
examine his views on the proper role of the reviewing courts in implementing health
and environmental legislation.

        The Role of Federal Courts in Health and Environmental Regulation.

        To understand how a Supreme Court Justice could possibly have an adverse
effect on human health or the environment, one must begin with an understanding of
the role that federal courts play in federal regulation. Under prevailing doctrines of
Administrative Law, arising out of the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
and various substantive statutes, the federal courts play a profound role in health and
safety regulation. Congress has in many cases assigned the federal courts the role of

                                                                 12
                                        503

stimulating action by lazy or recalcitrant federal agencies. The APA provides that a
reviewing court may compel agency action that is "unlawfully withheld or
unreasonably delayed," and specific deadlines in many environmental laws provide
Congress' guidance on how long particular tasks should take.1 The net result has been
a long line of "bureaucracy forcing" cases in which the beneficiaries of delayed
regulatory programs secure court orders forcing health and environmental agencies to
issue orders or promulgate rules by dates certain.2 For example, during the 1980s,
nearly every health standard issued by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) came only after a court had ordered OSHA to take up the
topic and decide whether or not to promulgate a regulation prior to a judicially
determined deadline.3

         The federal courts are also empowered to review agency orders and rules after
they have been promulgated and issued. Courts engaged in judicial review of agency
action can perform three basic functions. First, a court can review the agency's
interpretation of a statute or the constitution. In some cases petitioners allege that the
agency's action is unconstitutional or outside of the agency's delegated powers and
ask the court to restrain such unlawful exercises of bureaucratic power. More
frequently, petitioners accept the agency's power to address a particular topic, but

challenge the agency's interpretation of the statutory language that empowers the
agency.

         Second, a court can set aside agency action that is "without observance of
procedure required by law."1 Petitioners often challenge agency action on the ground
that the agency did not afford them an appropriate opportunity to present their side of
the issues. Or the petitioners may claim that the agency failed make a required
threshold finding or to prepare a necessary analytical document such as an
environmental impact statement or a regulatory flexibility analysis. These challenges
do not go to the existence of agency power or to the correctness of the agency's
conclusions. Rather, the challengers are insisting that the agencies "go by the book"
in taking actions that affect their interests.

         Third, petitioners may challenge the substance of the agency's resolution of an
issue or issues at the end of the relevant procedures. The Administrative Procedure
Act and many agency statutes require an agency's explanation for its action to come
up certain minimum measures of rational decisionmaking. For the most part, agency
action taken after formal proceedings, such as licensing hearings, must be supported
by "substantial evidence" in the record made before the agency.2 Informal agency
action, such as standard setting, must not be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."3

roles to disrupt an agency's policy-making initiatives, it should come as no surprise
that agencies are very aware of the possibility judicial review and adjust their conduct
accordingly. Applied with the deft touch envisioned in the Administrative Procedure
Act, judicial review can be a bulwark against the arbitrary exercise of bureaucratic
power. But judicial power can also be abused. Overly aggressive judicial intrusion
into the administrative process can greatly hinder the implementation of laws designed
to protect human health and the environment from dangerous private conduct. If
regulatory agencies like EPA and OSHA are not allowed to perform their assigned
tasks in an expeditious fashion, unprotected workers will be killed and maimed, and
irreparable environmental damage will needlessly result. It therefore behooves us to
examine where Judge Breyer, an acknowledged expert in administrative law, stands on
these somewhat arcane questions concerning the scope of judicial review of
administrative action.

Judge Brever on Statutory Interpretation.

        Since 1984, courts reviewing agency interpretations of their own statutes have
been guided by the so-called Chevron doctrine. The Supreme Court announced that
doctrine in a case involving an environmental group's challenge to EPA's policy of
allowing major sources of pollution in areas that did not meet air quality standards to
add new equipment or modify existing equipment without EPA review so long as they
came up with offsetting reductions in emissions within the same plant. As a prelude
to examining the statutory basis for this "bubble" policy, the Supreme Court spoke to
the role of courts in interpreting agency statutes:

                 When a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute which it
                                        506

        administers, it is confronted with two questions. First, always, is the question
        whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the
         intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well
         as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of
         Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly
         addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its
         own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an
         administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with
         respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's
         answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.

                  . . . If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is
         an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific
         provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative regulations are given
         controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary
         to the statute. Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a
         particular question is implicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may
         not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable
         interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.
This prescription for a very limited judicial role in statutory interpretation of agency
statutes has received a great deal of academic criticism, and it is not always clear that
the lower courts follow it religiously. Reviewing courts, including the Supreme Court
itself, are sometimes inclined to find the statute clear on its face when they disagree
with the agency's interpretation and to stretch to find ambiguity when they agree with
the agency.
         The existing sample of Judge Breyer's opinions involving judicial review of
statutory interpretation is too small to support any firm conclusions about his
                                        507

inclination to defer to agencies' interpretations of their own statutes. But his writing
on the subject indicates that he believes that the Chevron test is too simplistic to
provide guidance to the lower courts, given the wide variety of situations in which
agencies are called upon to interpret their own statutes.1 Judge Breyer doubts that
judges, who develop their own expertise in interpreting statutes, can adopt the
deferential frame of mind that the Chevron test demands:

        [Sjuch a formula asks judges to develop a cast of mind that often is
        psychologically difficult to maintain. It is difficult, after having examined a
        legal question in depth with the object of deciding it correctly, to believe both
        that the agency's interpretation is legally wrong, and that its interpretation is
        reasonable. More often one concludes that there is a "better" view of the
        statute . . . and that the "better" view is "correct," and the alternative view is
        "erroneous."2
        Given Judge Breyer's skeptical view of the deferential Chevron test, we should
expect Justice Breyer to reach his own conclusions about the "better" view of the
environmental statutes. Since Judge Breyer is not sympathetic to the existing statutory
regime for health and environmental regulation, Justice Breyer may be inclined to
interpret health and environmental statutes narrowly to preclude health and
environmental agencies from taking aggressive action at the outer edges of their

     1 Judge Breyer has also written on the related question of the role that legislative
history should play in judicial interpretation of statutes. See Stephen Breyer, On the Uses
of Legislative History in InterpreUng Statutes, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 845 (1991). In this
article, Judge Breyer convincingly rejects Justice Scalia's radical suggestion that
legislative history should play no role in statutory interpretation.

statutory authority. Justice Breyer's presumption in favor of allowing markets to
function without government intrusion may not easily be overcome by an agency's
interpretation of its statute to allow governmental intervention.

Judge Brever on Agency Procedures.

        Although Judge Breyer has had very little to say in the academic literature
about judicial review of an agency's procedural choices, he has authored four opinions
in cases involving challenges to agency failures to prepare environmental impact
statements (EISs). The court in two of the cases ruled in favor of the agencies;1 in
one case the court required the agency to prepare an EIS;2 and in another case the
court required the agency to prepare a supplemental EIS.3 In none of the cases was
the agency clearly out of bounds in failing to prepare an EIS. Yet in all four cases,
Judge Breyer examined very carefully the agency's reasons for foregoing the EIS and
measured the agency's explanation against the materials assembled in the substantial
administrative records. Given that the Supreme Court has not once in NEPA's twenty-

five year history ruled against an agency, Judge Breyer's apparent willingness to do so
half the time may indicate an activism with respect to this particular procedural issue
that is currently lacking on the Court.1

Judge Brever on Substantive Judicial Review of Agency Action.

        Judge Breyer has had a great deal to say in the academic literature about the
role that reviewing courts should play when they engage in substantive judicial review
of agency action under the "substantial evidence" and "arbitrary and capricious" tests.
Under existing judicial precedent "substantial evidence" means "more than a mere
scintilla." It is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion."2 An informal agency action is "arbitrary and capricious" if:

               [T]he agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended
               it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the
               problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to
               the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could
               not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency

        Judge Breyer's opinion in Watt demonstrates an inclination to require agencies to

benefit analysis is not as clearly required in statutes empowering EPA and OSHA to take
actions to protect health and the environment, and it is in fact forbidden by statute in
some contexts. See American Textile Mfrgs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490 (1981)
(occupational health standards); Lead Industries Ass'n v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130 (1980)
(national primary ambient air quality standards).

                expertise.1
                Both of these tests appear at first glance to be quite deferential, but
                they both leave substantial room for courts to substitute their policy
                judgments for those of the agencies. We have seen that Judge
                Breyer has strong opinions about the policies that should govern
                health and environmental regulation. The paramount question in
                the area of substantive judicial review is whether he will substitute
                his policy preferences for those of the health and environmental
                agencies.

                      Judge Breyer's writings suggest that he believes that the courts
                should take a deferential approach toward substantive judicial
                review. He is particularly sensitive to the question of the
                 institutional competence of federal courts to second-guess agency
                 attempts to resolve highly complex and uncertain science/policy
                disputes:

                                      . . . The court may not appreciate the agency's
                            need to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.
                            Compromises made to secure agreement among the parties
                            may strike a court as "irrational" because the agency
                            cannot "logically" explain them.

                                      [C]ourts work within institutional rules that
                            deliberately disable them from seeking out information
                            relevant to the inquiry at hand. . . .

                                  . . . The stricter the review and the more clearly
                         and convincingly the agency must explain the need for
                         change, the more reluctant the agency will be to change
                         the status quo.1
               Yet most of the examples that he cites of judicial overreaching
               involve cases in which the agency action was deregulatory in nature
               and therefore consistent with his laissez faire policy presumption.2
                         The critical question, on which Judge Breyer's existing
               judicial opinions shed very little light, is whether Justice Breyer
               will retain this sympathetic posture when the agency action runs
               counter to his strongly held preference for free markets. The
               reviewing courts have tremendous discretion under the "substantial
               evidence" and "arbitrary and capricious" tests to find gaps in the
               agency's analysis, to question the agency's assumptions, and to
               second guess how the agency resolves science/policy questions.

    2 For example, Judge Breyer is critical of the Supreme Court's opinion in Motor
Vehicle Manufacturers Ass*n v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,42 (1983),
a case in which the Court remanded a deregulatory initiative by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration withdrawing a previous rule requiring auto makers to
incorporate passive restraints in automobiles manufactured after 19»4. See Judicial
Review, supra, at 395. At the same time. Judge Breyer cites the Fifth Circuit opinion in
Aqua Slide^N'Dive Corp. v. Consumer Product Safety Comrn'n, 569 F.2d 831 (5th Cir.
1978) as an example of a court's ability under even a relaxed judicial supervisory attitude
"to catch the occasional agency policy decision that is in fact highly irrational. Judicial
Review, supra, at 395. The Fifth Circuit in Aqua Slide 'N'Dive overturned a regulation
of the Consumer Product Safety Commission aimed at making swimming pool slides safer
for the public. From a perspective other than Judge Breyer's presumption in favor of free
markets, the agency action was not at all irrational. The Fiftn Circuit opinion is in many
respects a paradigm of overly strict judicial review.

    for that of the appointed regulatory officials can be overwhelming.
    But it must be resisted if agencies are to be allowed to implement
    congressionally enacted regulatory programs to protect public health
    and the environment. For, as Judge Breyer clearly recognizes, a
    judicial remand of an important regulation can have a tremendous
    impact on the ongoing viability of a regulatory program.1

                                     Conclusion.

               Will Justice Breyer possess the fair-mindedness to consider
    the opinions of experts on both sides of science/policy debates?
    Will Justice Breyer have the humility to shelve his personal policy
    preferences and allow regulatory agencies to pursue the "last ten
    percent" of the health and environmental risks that Congress has
    empowered them to regulate? Will Justice Breyer exercise the
    good judgment to defer to congressional policy determinations
    when they differ dramatically from his own considered conclusions,
    even when he knows that he has thought longer and harder about
    the underlying issues than any individual congressperson?

               The members of the Senate Judiciary Committee should
     press Judge Breyer hard for honest answers to all of these

Justice Breyer will resolve the tension between his views on the
proper role for regulation in society and his views on the proper
role for the courts in reviewing regulatory agency actions. Only
after Judge Breyer has publicly addressed this tension can we know
whether Justice Breyer will be hazardous to our health.

Introduction

         In chapter 5 of his 1982 book, "Regulation and Its Reform," Judge Stephen Breyer
tries to use the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) as an example of
regulatory failure in standard setting. As the following shows, NHTSA's standard setting has
saved hundreds of thousands of lives and untold billions of dollars for consumers despite
strenuous opposition from industry.

         Until passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and its companion
Highway Safety Act in 1966, Americans did not have Federal regulatory agencies to protect
them from death and injury on the nation's highways. In that year, 53,000 people were killed
and 1.9 million injured. If the 1966 fatality rate of 5.70 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles
traveled had continued,1 over 165,000 people would have been killed in traffic accidents in
1993. Instead, the death rate was 1.8 and 39,800 were killed. The cost to society of motor
vehicle accidents is well over $100 billion.

Failure of the Auto Industry in a Free Market

         The first point that Judge Breyer misses is that left to its own in a free market, the
auto industry delivered increasing deaths, property damage, air pollution and wasted
resources. For the first 75 years of its existence, the motor vehicle industry was unregulated
and could have produced safe, efficient and clean cars but chose not to do so. In fact, the
auto companies conspired to suppress the development of pollution control technology that
would have made cars cleaner and more fuel efficient, knowingly held back such simple,
lifesaving technologies as laminated windshields and opposed the funding of mass transit that
would have made the nation less reliant on the motor vehicle.

NHTSA Standard Setting

          Head Restraints: Judge Breyer singles out NHTSA's Head Restraint Standard (FMVSS
 202) as an example of an ineffective regulation. Under Executive Order 12291 issued by
 President Reagan in February 1981 requiring Federal regulatory agencies to evaluate major
 rules, NHTSA evaluated the head restraint standard and found that FMVSS 202 prevented
 64,000 injuries in rear impacts annually saving $2,150 per injury based on average insurance
 company compensation for whiplash injuries. Thus the annual saving in injury costs was over
 $135 million for this standard.

          NHTSA found that the number of injuries prevented would have been 85,000 if all car
 companies had used integral head restraints instead of using adjustable head restraints in two-

          1While fatalities climbed steadily from 1900 to 1966, the fatality rate decreased
 through 1961 to 5.16 when it began to climb again as the auto companies increased horse
power and performance. The enormous increase vehicles and miles traveled overwhelmed
any decrease in the death rate and produced an annual death toll of 40-50,000 that society
found unacceptable.

thirds of their new cars. The choice of adjustable over integral head restraints flies in the
face of cost-benefit analysis because the purchase price increase for integral restraints is only
$6.65 versus $24.33 for adjustable restraints. Given a performance standard which Judge
Breyer favors, the auto makers picked the more costly and less effective technology to meet
the standard. If Congress had given NHTSA the authority to mandate a design standard
requiring integral restraints, the benefits would have outweighed the costs by 3.4 to 1.

         Passive Restraints: In his criticism of NHTSA's issuance of the passive restraint
standard, Judge Breyer engaged in sloppy research or deliberate revisionist history. Judge
Breyer assumes the ignition interlock (that required seat belts to be fastened before a car
could be started) substitute for airbags in 1974 was an idea of NHTSA. In fact, it was an
idea of Ford and its lawyer Lloyd Cutler to head off airbags.

         The protracted delay in installing airbags in cars was not due to some fatal flaw in
standard setting but was rather due to scorched earth opposition of the auto companies who
saw airbags giving auto safety regulation a good name. In overturning the Reagan
Administration's revocation of the passive restraint rule in 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court
called it right in a 9-0 unanimous decision saying, "The auto industry waged the regulatory
equivalent of war against the airbag, and lost."

         What better justification can there be of auto safety regulation than that it delivered
the lifesaving airbag, a technology too good to destroy and developed only because NHTSA
used its technology-forcing power to require" the auto industry to develop them. Separate
studies done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and NHTSA both show airbags
reduce occupant deaths by 28 to 29 percent. When all cars and vans are equipped, 9,000 to
12,000 lives a year will be saved and a quarter-million injuries a year will be prevented by
this important public health regulation.

         Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards: Judge Breyer makes a passing criticism of NHTSA
setting of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. His criticism is so short
because the program is so good. CAFE standards are simply the most successful energy
conservation program adopted by the United States. Today, we save nearly 3 million barrels
per day of petroleum due to improvements in fuel economy since Congress enacted the
Energy Petroleum Conservation Act of 1975 which required NHTSA to adopt CAFE
standards. The success of this program has helped reduced gasoline prices and has reduced
our dependence on uncertain supplies of oil from the Persian Gulf.

          Passenger car fuel economy has more than doubled since then while the vehicle
fatality rate has been cut in half in the same time. But for the fact that the Reagan/Bush
Administration rolled back CAFE standards for passenger cars and failed to increase CAFE
standards for light trucks and vans, we would now be saving over 5 million barrels per day of
petroleum. CAFE worked until the Reagan Administration stopped it at the behest of the auto
industry.

          Bumper Standards: Judge Breyer reluctantly concedes the 5-mph bumper standard
worked but attributed it to luck rather than sound analysis. Talk about sour grapes.
According to Judge Breyer, this regulation worked because NHTSA guessed right that the
industry would use soft face bumpers rather than steel. This was not a matter of guessing but
hard work and effective analysis. Anyone who was knowledgeable about the industry
realized that soft face bumpers were the bumpers of the future. Ironically, the one regulatory
success cited by Judge Breyer was later repealed by the Reagan Administration when it rolled
back the 5-mph bumper standard to 2.5-mph in 1982 ~ a devolution upheld by Judge Robert
Bork.

         Tire Ratings: A constant theme of Judge Breyer is that regulatory agencies take too
long to issue standards, as was the case with NHTSA when it took nearly 10 years longer
than Congress wanted in issuing uniform tire quality grading standards (UTQGS). What
Judge Breyer overlooks is that the delay is not due to inefficiencies on part of the agency but
frivolous opposition by the regulated industry, including protracted court battles.
                                     516

         The tire industry waged regulatory war against UTQGS just like the auto industry
waged regulatory war against the airfoag. There were court challenges. Congressional
hearings and White House interference just as there was with airbags. Only a citizen suit
brought by Public Citizen forced the agency to take action. But this cannot be cited as an
example of poor standard setting. If anything, it is heroic overcoming of objections raised by
a regulated industry. The proof of the success of UTQGS is that since it has been adopted as
a result of citizen litigation, tire treadwear has increased dramatically as the rating system has
forced tire companies to compete to produce longer lasting tires.

         Large Truck Antilock Brakes: Judge Brcyer asserts that NHTSA's technology-forcing
regulation for truck brakes "worked very badly ..." because some systems did not work and
"the systems changed too rapidly for mechanics to adjust." He says "the agency and industry
were wrongly optimistic about how much could be quickly accomplished" and suggests the
agency's lack of information makes it difficult to know whether compliance was impossible
or the industry did not try hard enough (pp. 106-7).

         Technology forcing standards are indeed complex and difficult. But in this case the
reasons for the problems with the first brakes produced to meet the standard are well known.
First, the standard was not rushed. It was first proposed five years before the effective date,
with various amendments along the way to accommodate industry critiques. Second, the
major truck brake manufacturing companies were convinced mat Gerald Ford, who became
president in 1974, a year before the standard took effect, would revoke the standard at their
request. As a result, they resisted investing in preparations for manufacture. When the
standard was not revoked, they rushed into production at the last moment and made lousy
systems.

         Other companies, specifically Delco and Wagner Electric, began producing competing
systems in 1977 which had none of the problems in the first systems manufactured. The
standard was not a failure. Many of the first products were inadequate and some did not even
comply because of industry negligence. The agency ordered a number of recalls. But in a
weird decision three years after the standard took effect in a trucking industry lawsuit, the 9th
Circuit said the agency erred in setting the standard but based its decision on experience with
systems manufactured after the standard took effect - information not known to the agency
when it issued the standard.

           The concept of electronic rather than mechanical brakes to stop 80,000 pound trucks
in shorter distances and keep them in the lane of traffic without jackknifing has been proven
successful beyond any doubt. Mechanical brakes are notoriously inadequate for these
behemoths. In 1991, Congress, irritated that the agency has not reissued the standard after 13
mostly Reagan/Bush years, mandated a rulemaking on antilock brakes with specific deadlines.
With this clear guidance, the agency has acted to reissue the standard.

Naive Criticism

         Some of Judge Breyer's criticism of NHTSA is simply naive. He claims that
"NHTSA...did not simply consider how it might best save lives" (p. 101). To the contrary,
reduction of death and injury are the criteria mandated by the statute and have been used by
NHTSA from the very beginning in selecting what standards to issue.

         The agency has also made major changes in its rulemaking actions over the years as
its information and sophistication advanced but has always been guided by its lifesaving
criteria. The first static standards were based on (but not identical to) existing standards.
Next came crash test dynamic standards, and then dynamic standards measuring injury levels
of dummies instrumented to simulate humans. All of this has been accomplished despite
harsh budget cuts at crucial times and a lack of political support in the White House over
many years.
                                     517

           In place of head restraints, Judge Breycr suggests "even a very rough cost-benefit
analysis" might have led NHTSA to work "on mandating special devices to stop illegal
speeding, such as flashing lights on the outside of a car that would indicate a speed of above
60 mph" (p. 101). What Judge Breyer failed to realize is that most whiplash injuries occur in
rear impacts in urban areas with speeds of impact under 40 mph. Regardless of the political
feasibility of making every car that goes over 60 mph look like a pinball machine, it would
do nothing to reduce whiplash injuries because most of the offending cars are going no faster
than 40 mph.

         In addition, the flashing light concept is highly speculative, can be very dangerous on
the highway, and was summarily rejected for further exploration in agency appropriations
hearings in 1977.

         Judge Breyer also suggests NHTSA should have trie<' to improve brake maintenance
instead of mandating new brake technology (antilock brakes ~ he calls them interlock). But
the agency has no statutory authority to require improved brake maintenance, and did in fact
urge the trucking industry to improve training for its brake mechanics.

         Judge Breyer also criticizes NHTSA for relying on voluntary SAE standards for its
first set of mandatory standards adopted in 1968. According to Judge Breyer, making the
SAE standards mandatory was a mistake because previously auto companies could "reject the
standards if they are absurd, inappropriate, or simply wrong." p. 102. What Judge Breyer
fails to realize is that the SAE standard-setting process was controlled by an oligopoly of
GM, Ford and Chrysler. SAE never set a standard the Big Three didn't want When
Congress passed the 1966 Motor Vehicle Safety Act, it specifically criticized the SAE
standards as being inadequate and failing to stem the rising tide of traffic fatalities. NHTSA
used only a few elements of SAE standards very selectively in its initial safety standards.

         Judge Breyer discusses performance and design standards but does not apparently
understand what a performance standard is. For example, he says, "...it may be as easy for the
agency to write its standard directly in terms of performance goals, such as cleaner air or
fewer injuries. On the other hand, performance standards are often difficult to enforce,
because they lead to complex arguments about the appropriate testing procedure for
differently designed machines" (p. 105).

         A performance standard does not measure the amount of injuries reduced. It contains
a test procedure, as for example with Standard 208 for passive restraints that an instrumented
dummy cannot suffer significant injuries in a crash test at 30 mph.

         Judge Breyer emphasizes many times that "The central problem of the standard-setting
process and the most pressing task facing many agencies is gathering the information needed
to write a sensible standard" (p. 109).

          While he makes interesting and accurate statements about deficiencies in information
such as self-interested industry information and industry withholding information to undercut
agency action, he suggests no remedies (such as the use of subpoenas or other mandatory
devices that NHTSA used for fuel economy rulemaking).

          Also, he doesn't indicate any appreciation for the role of agency technical and
scientific research which includes real world and proving ground testing, surveys, opinion
polls, marketing research, collection of statistical and in-depth data on crashes, injuries and
deaths, and on industry production plants, materials and testing, statistical analysis, production
of model and experimental vehicles and systems, to mention a few areas. For example,
NHTSA spends almost a third of its budget (over $40 million a year) on very sophisticated
research in-house and with outside consultants and universities for motor vehicle and highway
safety standards.

            Judge Breyer appears uninformed about agency research for rulemaking. He
describes the agency effort as follows:
                                     518

          "It will obtain the information, in part, through research by agency staff, as they
consult research literature and talk to employees of other agencies. Before the agency
formulates an initial proposal, the staff may consult widely outside the agency as well. Staff
members will telephone, write letters to and arrange meetings with independent experts,
industry experts~in fact anyone they consider knowledgeable. Once the Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking is promulgated, however, staff members may feel less free to consult widely. ...
Obtaining accurate, relevant information constitutes the central problem for the agency
engaged in standard setting. It has difficulty finding knowledgeable, trustworthy sources ..."
(pp. 102-3).

         "Developing information within the agency avoids the taint of industry self-interest,
but the aeencv mav lack the requisite technical ability. NHTSA was unable to develop fuel
conservation standards, for example" (emphasis added) (p. 111). He indicates NHTSA lacked
firm-specific information. He's wrong about the standards and about firm-specific
information. NHTSA research evaluated every transmission and engine plant for every U.S.
company, what was produced in terms of size and output, how many sold each year etc. In
other words, NHTSA knew not just about each company, but about each make/model in
preparation for issuance and as well as for evaluation of standards.

Conclusion

         Overall, NHTSA regulation of the auto industry has been a dramatic success with over
200,000 lives saved to date, over 2 million injuries prevented, billions of dollars of accident
loss avoided, and over 100 million gallons of gasoline saved every day. To the extent there
are inefficiencies in NHTSA's actions, it is because of loopholes in the law exploited or
created by the auto industry.

          Judge Breyer never mentions that most of the problems with truck brakes, passives,
tire information and bumpers flowed from the lack of leadership in the Nixon/Ford years
when the president disliked or at best was ambivalent about regulation while the industries
(tire, truck, auto, bumper) were all tigers against these standards. Who can forget the Henry
Ford/Iacocca meeting with President Nixon memorialized on the Watergate tapes where the
captains of industry asked the President to revoke the air bag rule and he did?

         Of the six NHTSA safety standards he uses to show the failures of the current
regulatory/adversary system, four (passive restraints, tire information, bumper damageability,
and fuel economy) were completed during the Carter Administration with no difficulty under
the administrative procedures he claims are problems. And all of them were difficult,
technology-forcing standards vehemently opposed by the relevant industries.

         He also never mentions the budget and top staff cuts the agency has suffered,
particularly in the Reagan years, which to this day have hamstrung NHTSA in development
of much needed technical information. It is amazing the agency got as much done as it did.

           NHTSA regulation could be even more successful than it is if there were (1) citizen
suits or rights of action to enforce mandates under the Safety Act, (2) broader standing to
challenge agency inaction, (3) criminal penalties for violation of the Safety Act, (4) NHTSA
authority to issue design as well as performance standards, (5) restored NHTSA funding cut
by Congress under pressure from industry lobbyists, and (6) restoration of the antitrust
injunction against joint industry lobbying and research on safety, emissions and fuel economy.

         The main thesis of Chapter 5 "Standard Setting," focusing primarily on NHTSA, is
that regulation under the procedural protections of the Administrative Procedure Act has many
pitfalls and with its reliance on an adversary process, it generally does not work well. The
better alternative, says Judge Breyer, is negotiation among various interested parties-the
industry, academics, consumers and the agency.

         For example, he says, "The procedural requirements of 'notice and comment'
                                    519

rulemaking encourage the agency to use a back-and-forth adversary trial-and-error approach to
obtain information and develop standards" (emphasis added) (p. 116).

           Difficulties with compliance are a reason "to seek negotiated standards that all
parties feel are reasonable, so that firms will not resist compliance" (p. 114).

           "Fairness in terms of an ability to hear and to meet arguments can be combined with
effectiveness only if all interested parties can meet informally and make various suggestions
until agreement is reached or all considerations are out in the open. But this discussion
cannot take place through back-and-forth, notice/comment/revise procedures" (p. 117).

         "This back-and-forth process may prevent the agency from revising the standard
optimally in light of the last set of comments for fear of provoking new hearings. The
agency may determine the standard's content initially through informal meetings and
negotiation with those affected, later 'ratifying' the decision with a more formal procedure.
The courts may hold this process unlawful, however, as an effort to circumvent the law's
procedural requirements" (p. 117, fn. 44).

           "One sees, for example, obvious major advantages for the agency in achieving
 mutually satisfactory ('negotiated') solutions, given the agency's comparative inability to
 secure necessary information--particularly as to costs and competitive impacts, the desirability
 of securing voluntary compliance procedures and industry cooperation in developing
 enforcement procedures, and the time and effort saved if judicial challenge can be avoided"
 (p. 118).

          "One sees the time needed to develop standards as stemming in part from the
 difficulties of obtaining appropriate information and the need to force a multifaceted or
 'polycentric' problem into an adversary mode" (p. 119).

          Judge Breyer concedes that, "None of these problems warrants abandoning the
 standard-setting process, nor do these difficulties pose insurmountable obstacles. They are
 simply tendencies - likely to be present - that administrators must take into account when
 planning strategies for developing workable sets of standards" (p. 119).

          But his entire chapter denigrates and undercuts the effectiveness of rulemaking for
 setting standards. Moreover, his points are often off base or lack thorough understanding of
 the work of NHTSA.

                       PROPOSED QUESTIONS FOR JUDGE BREYER

  (1) QUESTION: "When your nomination was announced, you
 stated that your aspiration was to make the law work for
  xordinary people'. By that, did you mean, simply, that the
 law should serve the interests of the majority of the
 people? Or do you mean, also, that it should enhance their
 opportunity and capacity to participate actively in our
 democratic political life?"

         Comment; For two reasons, all of the proposed
          questions get at matters of general attitude, not
          specific cases. First, nominees have learned to avoid
          specific questions. And, second, matters of attitude
         matter, and questions about attitude may actually stick
         with the nominee after confirmation. This first
         question -- again like the others -- is written so as
         to make it very likely that the nominee will hear
         himself making the desired answer. In this instance,
         the answer sets up the most fundamental problem of law
         in the late twentieth century: Do we want -- and can
         we have -- government for the people without government
         of and by. the people?

 (2) QUESTION: "The constitutional provision whose
 interpretation has most to do with the participation of
 ordinary people in our democracy is the Free Speech clause.
Do you agree with Justice Brennan's reading of that clause
that speech should be *free, robust and wide open'? And, if
so, what does that mean, in particular, for the opportunity
and capacity for ordinary people to speak effectively?"

         Comment: Justice Brennan offered this famous formula
         -- of great symbolic importance to constitutional
         lawyers -- in United States v. Robel. 389 U.S. 258
         (1967). It represents one magnetic pole of free speech
         argument. Yet no lawyer will reject it.

 (3) QUESTION: "Do you, then, agree that free speech
protection should not be limited to the most politely
* reasonable' * exposition of ideas' -- that it should extend
to modes of expression most characteristic of ordinary
people?"

         Comment: The question invites the nominee to forswear
         the other magnetic pole of free speech argument. For
        decades, conservatives have used this formula to bias
        constitutional protection against ordinary people.

(4) QUESTION: "Do you agree, also, that the First
Amendment demands more than a right of ordinary people to
read or hear speech -- that it demands that they be
empowered to participate, effectively, in speech
themselves?"

        Comment: In recent years, many conservatives have
        tried to collapse the right to produce speech into a
                                   521

        right to consume the speech of others. This,
        obviously, favors the powerful and well-to-do at the
        expense of ordinary people who do not own a broadcast
         license or other medium for promulgating their views?

(5) QUESTION: "Do you, then, agree with Justices White and
Powell that the Amendment is concerned, importantly, with
the distribution of effective opportunities to speak? That
the very well-to-do or corporations should not be protected
in *drowning out' the speech of ordinary people? Or do you
take the view that this concern is * foreign' to the First
Amendment?"

        Comment: This gets to the crux. The pernicious idea
        that distributional concerns are "foreign" to the
        Amendment was famously stated in Buckley v. Valeo. 424
        U.S. 1 (1976). Justice White's counter-view was stated
        not only in his Buckley opinion, but most notably in
        his majority opinion in Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC.
        395 U.S. 367 (1969). Justice Powell's recognition of a
        "drown-out" concern came in First National Bank v.
        Bellotti. 435 U.S. 765 (1978).

(6) QUESTION: "Very often, the opportunity of ordinary
people to speak effectively depends on access to forums for
speech controlled and used by the well-to-do corporations.
In recent years, some have interpreted the First Amendment
to deny them this opportunity. Some have said that
* property' rights override free speech rights or that access
would impermissably * coerce' the rich to join in the speech
of ordinary people, or that access must be denied to
ordinary people because, otherwise, the rich supposedly
would stop speaking themselves. What do you think of this
idea that the rights of the well-to-do to speak * trump' the
rights of the majority of people?"

        Comment: Now, we're in territory worrying to any
        nominee. But it poses one of the most vital problems
        of free speech law -- a problem which the Burger and
        Rehnquist Courts have often resolved in favor of the
        rich and corporations. Examples are Pacific Gas &
        Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission. 475 U.S. 1
         (1986) and Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo. 418 U.S.
        241 (1974). The great Warren Court opinion (by Justice
        Marshall) taking the other view was Amalgamated Food
        Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza. 391 U.S. 308
        (1968) (now overruled). In 1980, the Court at least
        allowed States, if they so choose, to compel access to
        some such forums in Pruneyard Shopping Center v.
        Robins. 447 U.S. 74 (1980).

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Dr. Wolfe.

                    STATEMENT OF DR. SIDNEY M. WOLFE

  Dr. WOLFE. According to Judge Breyer, because the existing sys-
tem fails to rationally cope with risk assessment management, a
new entity, a priesthood of people outside of the regulatory agen-
cies, the courts and the Congress, should be created, according to
what he states in his book "Closing the Vicious Circle."

  As a frequent critic of and litigant against FDA and OSHA, I am
not here to say that these agencies are perfect, but I believe that
through existing mechanisms, including the checks and balances of
the other parts of the Government and citizen participation, that
these agencies could be made to function better.

  If there is one reason why they do not currently function better,
it is not because of the absence of a Judge Breyer "risk superbody,"
but because of relentless interference with their function by cor-
porations which withhold information, submit false information
and otherwise obstruct the activities of these agencies.

  I am just going to go through several examples, all of which are
taken from his book "Closing the Vicious Circle." They are just rep-
resentative examples of a much larger number of instances in
which Judge Breyer has done I believe sloppy and often in many
cases biased research.

  The first has to do with the Delaney clause. Yesterday, when he
testified here, he talked about we can't count molecules, what num-
ber of molecules, and the implication was that there is government
regulatory activity being taken on the basis of a few molecules.

  One of the ways of criticizing Federal health and safety regula-
tions is to paint a statute as ridiculous. In his book, Judge Breyer
paints the 30-year-old amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, the Delaney clause as ridiculous. The Delaney clause prohibits
the addition of any food or color additive which, in well-done stud-
ies in animals or humans, has been shown to cause cancer.

  On page 41 of the book, he states that:

  Occasionally, a statutory provision goes further itself, setting a standard that, if
applied literally, seems unreasonably and pointlessly strict. The Delaney Clause
seems to instruct the agency not to permit addition or packaging of or by any sub-
stance that contains even a single molecule of an offending chemical, however large
the cost or small the risk.

  In making this faulty assertion, Judge Breyer has either missed
or ignored FDA's constituents policy, which was set over 10 years
ago, which makes it clear that his fears of unreasonably and point-
lessly strict interpretation of the Delaney clause are unfounded.
This policy was upheld in the face of a Federal court challenge, and
it arose over FDA's decision to approve a drug and cosmetic dye,
Green 5, even though the dye contained trace amounts of a chemi-
cal impurity, p-toluidine, which itself was a carcinogen.

  The FDA found that, although the contaminant carcinogen, when
it was fed itself in large quantities, caused cancer, that it was there
in such a small amount in the dye, that when the dye was fed to
animals, they did not get cancer. It concluded this was not a food
additive or a color additive, and in this case it showed that the
                                             523

Delaney clause is a good law, that it has some reason and it is not
"unreasonably and pointlessly strict."

  Other errors in the book include his gross understatement of the
number of workers who are injured or in this case killed every year
from occupational cancer. He says that all people killed by cancer
from pollution and industrial products amount to only 10,000 to
50,000 deaths a year. But in the footnotes, not in the text of the
book, buried in the footnotes he has estimates ranging from 75,000
to 150,000 cancer deaths a year, and for occupational cancer alone
one estimate is as high as 75,000.

  But worse is the omission of the importance of preventing occu-
pational cancer. He says that:

  Only a relatively small portion of these chemical induced cancers are preventable.
In fact, almost all of the 10,000 to 100,000 occupational cancer deaths (the range
in the book) are preventable.

  To his credit, when I pointed this out to him, in the second edi-
tion of the book he changed it.

  Most of the evidence for chemical induced cancer is among work-
ers. Therefore, most chemical induced cancer from inexcusably de-
layed regulation of various substances, including benzene, cad-
mium, and chromium, is and has been preventable and regulatable.
He also denigrates the ability to regulate cigarettes and tobacco,
claiming that only 30 percent of those cancer deaths could be pre-
vented. I think there is lots of evidence that that is not the case.

  Another error in the book is that he seems to go with the OMB
conclusion, as he calls it, that there is an overestimation of risk of
a thousand or a million times, particularly in the area of environ-
mental hazards. The conclusion that he cites is actually from an
OMB economist, and this conclusion was attacked by a large group
of prestigious risk-assessment experts, including the former Direc-
tor of the National Cancer Institute.

  In the letter they wrote to the White House, refuting this notion
that there is a systematic 1,000 to 1,000,000 overstatement of risk,
they said:

  The broader allegation that risk assessment is genetically "conservative" is de-
monstrably suspect. * * * The OMB document (and the references cited therein)
fails to provide any evidence that risk assessment is, in fact, systematically "con-
servative."

  Finally, an example that you have discussed a number of times
during this hearing, the toxic dump site in Kingston, NH, known
because of its name in the litigation as Ottati and Goss. In the
book, there are a number of statements that Judge Breyer makes
referring to this case, including the idea that the site was mostly
cleaned up, that it was a swamp and, therefore, children would not
play there, and that the parties had agreed that half of the volatile
organic toxic chemicals would evaporate by the year 2000.

  In the actual opinions that he wrote on this case, and in other
documents we have obtained, these statements are demonstrably
false. The statement that the site was mostly cleaned up is refuted
in his own opinion in the first circuit, in which he said:

   We remand this aspect of the case to the district court so that it can devise a fur-
ther volatile organic chemical cleanup which, in light of its findings about danger
to the public health, will adequately satisfy the public interest.

  He also said in the opinion that:
                                              524

  The studies and related testimony indicate that such overstandard concentrations,
too high concentrations of these toxic chemicals, are widespread and in significant
amounts within the total test area.

  Elsewhere in the opinions in his court and in the district court
and in briefs filed in the case is other evidence that these state-
ments about this case, which he uses repeatedly in the book to cite
the example of ridiculous government regulation, are wrong. In the
Government's brief, the site, this toxic dump site was referred to
by one of the defendants' own counsel as "severely contaminated."

  Other evidence concerning it has to do with levels of ground
water contamination which, according to a State official I spoke to
yesterday, are thousands of--are more than a thousand times high-
er than the allowable amount of contamination in ground water.
And right now, despite the fact that Judge Breyer characterized
this site as mostly clean several years ago, there is a massive
cleanup effort beginning to try and do something about the ground
water so that it does not migrate to adjacent sites where people are
likely to live. He also characterizes it as a swamp, which it is not.
It is actually zoned for rural residential use.

  Finally, he claims again in the book that half of the volatile or-
ganic chemicals will evaporate by the year 2000, and the planned
cleanup of the site belies that. In fact, that statement was made
by the counsel for the defendant. The parties did not agree on that.

  In conclusion, for me and for many others concerned^ about occu-
pational and environmental health and food safety, it is extremely
disappointing that President Clinton was unable or unwilling to
nominate someone with a more enlightened attitude toward the so-
lution of these serious problems. Although stating that economic
considerations are not as decisive in health, safety, and environ-
mental regulation, Judge Breyer's views as expressed in this book
amount to an unfair and unwarranted bashing of the very Federal
agencies who are trying to prevent toxic chemical-induced deaths
and illnesses. I can only hope that, good listener that he is, Judge
Breyer will listen to these concerns and, to use his terms, become
more influenced by the humanity of John Donne than by the cor-
porate hand of Adam Smith, as he appears to be at this time.

  Thank you.
  [The prepared statement of Dr. Wolfe follows:]

                        PREPARED STATEMENT OF SIDNEY M. WOLFE, M.D.

  In statements made at these hearing on Tuesday, July 12, Judge Breyer said that
he distinguished between classic economic regulation (airlines and trucks) and
health, safety and environmental regulation. He said: "When you start talking about
health, safety and the environment, the role [of economics] is much more limited,
because there no one would think that economics is going to tell you how much you
want to spend helping the life of another person. If in fact people want to spend
a lot of money to help save earthquake victims in California, who could say that
was wrong? * * * That's a decision for Congress to make reflecting the values of
people." Whereas there is no reason to question Judge Breyer's attitudes about the
victims of natural disasters, his recent book, Closing the Vicious Circle deals exclu-
sively with industry-caused disasters. Throughout the book are examples wherein
he minimizes the risks of exposure to various chemicals and questions and dep-
recates health and safety laws or the efforts which the federal health and safety
agencies make to protect the lives he professes to cherish.

  According to Judge Breyer, because the existing system fails to rationally cope
with risk assessment and its management, a new entity, a priesthood of people out-
side of the regulatory agencies, the courts and the Congress, should be created. As
a frequent critic of, and litigant against the FDA and OSHA, I am not here to say
                                      525

these agencies are perfect. I believe, however, that through existing mechanisms, in-
cluding the checks and balances of the other parts of the government and citizen
participation, that these health and safety regulatory agencies can be made to func-
tion better. If there is one reason why they do not currently function better, it is
not because of the absence of a Judge Breyer "risk superbody," but because of re-
lentless interference with their function by corporations which withhold information,
submit false information and otherwise obstruct the activities of these agencies.

  The examples of flawed and/or biased research by Judge Breyer which I will dis-
cuss are drawn from his recent book, Closing the Vicious Circle, originally published
in 1993, with the slightly revised edition published several months ago. These are
but a few representative examples of a much larger number which Judge Breyer
discusses in the book.

                                                   THE DELANEY CLAUSE

  One of the ways of criticizing federal health and safety regulation is to paint a
statute as ridiculous. Judge Breyer, in Closing the Vicious Circle does just that with
the Delaney Clause. This 30-plus year-old amendment to the Food Drug and Cos-
metic Act prohibits the addition of any food (or color) additive which, in well-done
studies in animals or humans, has been shown to cause cancer. On page 41 of the
book, Breyer states that "Occasionally a statutory provision goes further, itself set-
ting a standard that, if applied literally, seems unreasonably and pointlessly strict.
* * * The Delaney Clause, applicable to food [and color] additives * * * seem[s] to
instruct the agenc[y] not to permit addition * * * or packaging of or by any sub-
stance that contains even a single molecule of an offending chemical, however large
the cost or small the risk."

  In making this faulty assertion, Breyer has either missed or ignored FDA's con-
stituents policy, which makes it clear that his fears of an "unreasonably and point-
lessly strict" interpretation of the Delaney Clause is unfounded. This policy--in ef-
fect for more than a decade--has been upheld in the face of a federal court chal-
lenge. In 1982, the FDA approved a drug and cosmetic dye. Green 5, even though
the dye contained trace quantities of a chemical impurity, p-toluidine, itself a car-
cinogen. Although p-toluidine alone, fed in large quantities, was a carcinogen, large
quantities of Green 5, even though containing trace amounts of p-toluidine, did not
cause cancer in animals. In its 1982 regulation approving of the dye, the FDA ar-
gued that p-toluidine itself was not a color additive and that, therefore, the Delaney
Clause was inapplicable. This regulation was upheld in Scott v. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984).

  In this case, involving a direct color additive, it is clear that the FDA has the au-
thority and flexil ility to apply the Delaney Clause, in the case of food or color addi-
tives, in a way which protects the public health but which, Judge Breyer notwith-
standing, is not "unreasonably and pointlessly strict."

            UNDERSTANDING OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CANCER DEATHS

   On page 6 of the book, Breyer states that the "range of expert estimates" for those
cases of cancer which are caused by pollution and industrial products is from 10,000
to 50,000 deaths a year out of the 500,000 cancer deaths each year. In the endnotes,
at the back of the book, however, is one expert estimate which has occupational
toxic chemicals causing from 10 to 20 percent of all cancers and environmental toxic
exposures causing from 5 to 10 percent of all cancers for a sum of 15 percent to
30 percent of all cancers or 75,000 to 150,000 cancer deaths a year. Another expert
mentioned in the back of the book--former government occupational health physi-
cian Dr. Phillip Landrigan, now Chief of Occupational Medicine at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine--estimated that occupational cancer along may account for as
many as 75,000 cancers deaths a year. This is also cited in the references but ig-
nored in the text of the book.

  Equally striking is the omission, in the first edition of the book, of the importance
of preventable occupational cancer. On page 6, it says that "only a relatively small
portion of these [chemically-caused cancers] are preventable." In fact, almost all of
the 10,000 to 100,000 occupational cancer deaths (the range of the expert estimates
cited by Breyer in the book) are preventable and, to his credit, when this serious
error was pointed out, the second edition was changed. Most of the evidence for
chemical-induced cancer is among workers. Therefore, most chemical-induced can-
cer--from inexcusably delayed regulation of such substances as benzene, cadmium,
chromium, ethylene oxide and many other chemicals--is and has been preventable
and "regulatable."

                                    ACCUSATIONS ABOUT OVERSTATING RISKS

   On page 47 of the book, and in many other places, Breyer argues that, especially
in the area of EPA and OSHA regulation, the magnitude of risk is greatly over-
stated. On page 47, Breyer says, OMB argues that the agencies apply these as-
sumptions too conservatively; it concludes that, taken together, they 'often' over-
stated risks by factors of 1,000 or even a million or more. * * * At the same time,
even such assumptions sometimes can overlook special, much greater than average
exposures--exposures via multiple pathways, or exposures that pose special risks to
those who also smoke or are also exposed to other chemicals."

   To illustrate his statement that OMB "concludes" that regulators who use con-
servative assumptions to estimate risk may overstate risks by 1,000 to one million
times, Breyer cites OSHA's basis for setting standards for cancer-causing chemicals
(page 46 of Closing the Vicious Circle): OSHA assumes factory worker exposure 8
hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year for 45 years, that agency's example
of this "conservatism".

   In fact, OMB's conclusion about overstated risks is from a 1990 OMB report,
"Current Regulatory Issues in Risk Assessment and Risk Management", written by
OMB economist Richard Belzer. The report was attached by a prestigious group of
experts in risk assessment including former National Cancer Institute Director, Dr.
Arthur Upton, former New England Journal of Medicine epidemiology consultant
and current Chair of the Department of Epidemiology, McGill University, Dr. John
Bailar, Dr. Clark Health, Vice President for Epidemiology and Statistics, American
Cancer Society and Dr. Adam Finkel, of the Center for Risk Management, Resources
for the Future.

   In a January 30, 1991 letter from these scientists to Dr. D.A. Bromley in the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, they stated that "The broader
allegation that risk assessment is generically 'conservative' is demonstrably sus-
pect--The OMB document (and the references cites therein) fails to provide any evi-
dence that risk assessment is in fact systematically 'conservative'."

  In summary, on this point of a 1,000 to one million times overstatement of risk,
the evidence to support such a claim is non-existent, in 1991 as well as the present.

                      TOXIC SUPERFUND DUMP SITE: KINGSTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE

  In the first Superfund site case under that law, a toxic dump site, known as Ottati
and Goss was the subject of litigation by EPA in a Federal District Court and in
the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, the court where Judge Breyer is the
Chief Judge. The purpose of this example is not to challenge the First Circuit's up-
holding of the District Court's ruling tliat there was a need for abatemenyremedi-
ation of the contaminated groundwater. Instead, the dispute is with the misleading
way Judge Breyer characterizes this case in the book. On page 11 and 12, he says:
"The site was mostly cleaned up." Referring to the concerns of children eating con-
taminated dirt on the site, he said "But there were no dirt-eating children playing
in the area, for it was a swamp. Nor were dirt-eating children likely to appear there,
for future building seemed unlikely. The parties also agreed that at least half of the
volatile organic chemicals would likely evaporate by the year 2000."

  What follows is drawn from the District Decision, the First Circuit's decision, and
the government's (EPA's) brief (GB) and reply brief (RB) in the First Circuit Court
of Appeals.

A. "The site was mostly cleaned up."
  The site was not mostly cleaned up, and Judge Breyer knows this. Judge Breyer

states, "We have examined those portions of the record that the parties have cited
in their briefs." 900 F.2d 429, 432 (1st Cir. 1990). (a) IMC's (the remaining defend-
ant's) own expert admitted that the average concentration of PCBs left on the site
after cleanup was 87 ppm, "The contractor * * * seems to have accepted a charac-
terization of an 'average' level of 87 [ppm] as reasonable." 900 F.2d 440, (b) A post
cleanup study of 62 randomly selected test sites amounting to less than 1 percent
of the site's total area, "uncovered 4 drums in that small area alone." Government
Brief p. 40, (c) the PCB concentrations in the soil at the site are well above 50 ppm,
and at least as high as 143 ppm. Three of five "samples exceeded 50 ppm (56, 134,
and 143 ppm, respectively),"" 900 F.2d 441, (d) "[t]he government's eight laboratory
samples for VOCs at the IMC site post cleanup showed VOCs as high as 870 ppm,"
GB p. 46, (e) "[w]ithout VOC soil cleanup, the source of groundwater contamination
will persist for decades," GB p. 47, and (f) IMC's own witness's statement that he
"would be amazed if there were not some PCBs on the surface." Reply Brief, note
6. IMC also admitted using soil with PCBs up to 50 ppm as backfill, 694 Fed Supp
977, 982 (D.N.H. 1988).
                                             527

B. "The remaining private party litigated the cost of cleaning up the last little bit,
     a cost of about $9.3 million to remove a small amount of highly diluted PCBs
     and 'volatile organic compounds' (benzene and gasoline components) by incin-
     erating the dirt."

  Not a "last little bit" (VOCs 870 ppm, average 87 according to IMC; 3/5 samples
were greater than 50 PCBs, 900 F.2d 441).

  The PCB left was not a small amount and was not highly diluted.
  The VOCs left consisted of more than benezene and gasoline: acetone, arsenic,
chloroform, creosol, toluene, trichloroethylene (which was found to be 3,000 times
higher than the acceptable concentration in some of the wells), to name a few (com-
prehensive list at 630 Fed Supp 1361, 1383-90 (D.N.H. 1985)).
C. "But there were no dirt-eating children playing in the area there, for it was a

     swamp. Nor were dirt-eating children likely to appear there, for future building
     seemed unlikely."
  A description of the site is found at 630 Fed Supp 1366. "The site is zoned rural
residential according to the Kingston Zoning Ordinance," meaning "you can build a
single family or a two story dwelling." Fed Supp 1000. "But the undisputed fact is
that the site is zoned residential, which means that it may be developed for vir-
tually any purpose." RB at 6.
  There is no building there, but not because it is a swamp. "* * * IMBC's real es-
tate witness stated that the site could have developed residentially but for the con-
taminate remaining on site, and explained that his conclusion concerning current
development of the site was based on a view of the property during which he saw
Tiorrible looking water1 and on the statement by IMC's counsel, after IMC's cleanup
attempt, that the site was 'severely contaminated.'" RB at 7.
D. "The parties also agreed that at least half of the volatile organic chemicals would
     likely evaporate by the year 2000."
  An IMC expert testified to this theory, 900 F.2d 440, but the Government dis-
puted it in detail, "Allowing mere diffusion of VOCs in the soil rather than remedi-
ation would result in effectively condemning the site for use the foreseeable future,
a 'remedy' plainly not permissible under Section 121 of CERCLA." See 42 U.S.C.
9621(b)(l) (strong preference for remedial action which "permanently and signifi-
cantly reduces the volume, toxicity or mobility of the hazardous substance)." RB p.
7.

                                                           CONCLUSION

  For me, and for many others concerned about occupational and environmental
health and food safety, it is extremely disappointing that President Clinton was un-
able or unwilling to nominate someone with a more enlightened attitude toward the
solution of these serious problems. Although stating that economic considerations
are not as decisive in health, safety and environmental regulation, Judge Breyer*s
views, as expressed in this book, amount to an unfair and unwarranted bashing of
the very federal agencies who are trying, to prevent toxic chemical-induced deaths
and illnesses. I can only hope that, good listener that he is, Judge Breyer will listen
to these concerns ad, to use his terms, become more influenced by the humanity of
John Donne than by the corporate hand of Adam Smith, as appears to be the case
at this time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Dr. Wolfe.
  Mr. Constantine.

                   STATEMENT OF LLOYD CONSTANTINE

  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Thank you, Senator. It is a pleasure to be
back here again.

  I oppose the nomination of Judge Breyer principally on the basis
of his antitrust jurisprudence. One might ask why Judge Breyer's
record in this area should be of substantial concern for the Senate.
I think it should for several reasons.

  Judge Breyer is a leading antitrust scholar and jurist who has
written many important decisions interpreting our competition
laws. I believe an understanding of the way Judge Breyer ap-
proaches his role as a judge in antitrust cases is crucial to under-
                                             528

standing his overall approach to the role of the judiciary in our so-
ciety.

  Antitrust scholars and practitioners widely recognize Judge
Breyer to be among the major jurists revising and reinterpreting
the antitrust laws according to one narrow school of economic
thought.

  In July 1990, I testified before the Commerce Committee con-
cerning the capacity of antitrust law to address the problem of
international trade predation. At that time I told Senators Gorton
and Bryan that the antitrust laws had little remedial value for this
problem because they had been reduced to trivial laws primarily
concerned with a trivial debate about a little triangle, which I of-
fered to draw for the committee at that time. Two months later,
Judge Breyer actually drew that triangle in his opinion in Town of
Concord v. Boston Edison while he reversed a $39 million verdict
for Senator Kennedy's constituents in Concord and Wellesley, MA.

  On Tuesday, Judge Breyer said that he nullified the jury verdict
in order to lower electricity prices to all consumers in Massachu-
setts. This is clearly not the case. Town of Concord involved a price
squeeze, which occurs when a power company sells electricity at a
wholesale price which is just below, at, or sometimes above the
price at which it sells electricity at retail. The remedy for this pred-
atory practice is not, as Judge Breyer suggested, to raise retail
prices but to lower wholesale prices.

  On Tuesday, Judge Breyer stated that he decided cases "one at
a time" and that he did not "like to be professorial." However, in
this decision, Judge Breyer expounds on many issues in cases not
before the court. Although Town of Concord involved a price
squeeze in a fully regulated industry, Judge Breyer went to great
lengths to call into question the settled law involving price squeez-
es in unregulated industries and to criticize the soundness of Judge
Learned Hand's classic price-squeeze analysis in the Alcoa case.

  Judge Breyer then went on to unnecessarily expound to so-called
single monopoly profit theory which, among neoclassical price theo-
rists, is an article of faith. According to this theory, a monopolist
will earn as much profit in a single market as it would if it ex-
tended its monopoly into a second market. Several conclusions flow
from this theory. One is that in most cases the antitrust laws
should not care if a monopolist extends his power from one market
into another.

  Town of Concord sets forth a significant part of the agenda which
Judge Breyer has set for cases which will come before him when
he is on the Supreme Court. His opinion strongly predicts that
Judge Breyer will vote to overturn the per se rule of illegality in
trying cases. He will reject the rule against price squeezes in non-
regulated industries. He will find that vertical mergers, which ex-
tend a dominant position from one market to an upstream or down-
stream market, are either competitively neutral or procompetitive.
Finally, when the Supreme Court inevitably resolves the split in
the circuits on whether monopoly leveraging constitutes a violation
of section 2 of the Sherman Act, Judge Breyer will find that there
is no violation.

  Judge Breyer's brooding concern for the rights and prerogatives
of monopolists is a theme in many of his decisions.
                                      529

  For example, in the Barry Wright case, Judge Breyer found that
a monopolist who made shock absorbers for the nuclear power
plant construction industry did not violate the antitrust laws.
Judge Breyer found that the defendant had 94 percent of the mar-
ket; it had introduced selective discounts of 25 to 30 percent in re-
sponse to the entry of a new competitor; and it employed contracts
which required customers to buy their total estimated needs and
further required 100-percent forfeiture of the contract price upon
cancellation.

  Taking the alleged exclusion acts one at a time, he ruled that
none of them violated the antitrust laws. But this piecemeal meth-
od of analysis avoided the logical conclusion that acts which viewed
separately as benign may collectively be extremely anticompetitive.
This is the lesson of Judge Hand's brilliant analysis in Alcoa. An
example closer to Judge Breyer's home was Judge Wyzanski's clas-
sic decision in United Shoe Machinery, where, again, a series of
separately lawful actions were held to collectively constitute illegal
acts of monopolization.

  Judge Wyzanski's famous statement still resonates today. He
said:

  The dominance of any one enterprise inevitably * * * accentuates that enter-
prise's experience and views as to what is possible, practical, and desirable with re-
spect to technological development, research, relations with producers, employees,
and customers. And the preservation of any unregulated monopoly is hostile to the
industrial and political ideas of an open society founded on the faith that tomorrow
will produce a better than the best.

  In contrast, Judge Breyer looks to monopolists or dominant firms
to produce lower prices, a notion which is both economically
counterintuitive and contrary to the basic purpose of the antitrust
laws.

  In Barry Wright, the plaintiff challenged as predatory, prices
which were above the defendants' average total costs, a situation
which most antitrust judges consider lawful. But for no reason
other than serving a separate agenda, Judge Breyer went on to de-
cide that prices that were below average total cost but above the
producers' incremental costs were also not predatory.

  Again, in the Kartell case, Judge Breyer nullified a district court
finding

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Mr. Constantine. You have gone way
over, and I am in a bind. I have 2 minutes to get over there to vote.
1 am going to have to end your statement here. We will come back
with Professor Estes. You can conclude when I come back, but I
will be gone. There are going to be two votes back-to-back. I have
2 minutes to make this vote. I will vote and come back, and then
we will go to Professor Estes and questions.

  [Recess.]
  Senator HATCH [presiding]. Mr. Constantine, why don't you con-
clude?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. OK. Well, thank you, Senator. I was just get-
ting into finishing up.
  As I was saying, in the Kartell case, Judge Breyer nullified a dis-
trict court finding that Blue Shield, with a 74-percent share of the
health insurance market, did not violate the antitrust laws by
adopting a practice which fixed the prices received by virtually all
                                             530

Massachusetts physicians. Judge Breyer honestly believes that,
once again, a monopolist can be counted on to deliver lower prices.

  What is totally missing from this decision--indeed, missing from
all of Judge Breyer's decisions--is healthy skepticism about the
long-term benefits of monopoly power, a skepticism which is the
very core of the Sherman Act. Also missing is recognition of just
how high and escalating were health care prices in an environment
characterized by dominant rather than competing third-party pay-
ers.

  To illustrate his method in Kartell, Judge Breyer compared buy-
ing health care to buying a fleet of taxicabs. Judge Breyer is un-
doubtedly a brilliant man, but much of the real world and the real
marketplace is alien to him. I fear that the narrow ideological focus
that Judge Breyer has demonstrated consistently in his antitrust
opinions will typify his approach to other areas of the law when he
is constrained only by his own sense of what is economically effi-
cient.

  In concluding, I would like to just briefly talk about the last anti-
trust decision by Judge Breyer in March of 1994, Caribe BMW.
This was the first time in his career that he found for a plaintiff
in an antitrust case. The decision is the most disturbing of all
Judge Breyer's rulings. Only Judge Breyer knows whether this dra-
matic turnabout was motivated by the widely known fact that he
was under consideration for the next position on the Court.

  Caribe BMW involved a car dealer in Puerto Rico which com-
plained that it was victimized by two violations of the antitrust
laws. First, it said it was the victim of price discrimination viola-
tive of the Robinson-Patman Act because BMW sold cars to other
dealers at a lower price than it received. Caribe also claimed that
BMW was trying to lower Caribe's retail prices by engaging in
maximum vertical price fixing. It is true that maximum vertical
price-fixing violates the law. However, Judge Breyer stretched as
hard for the plaintiff, as he traditionally does for the defendant. It
is also true that the rule against maximum vertical price fixing and
the Robinson-Patman Act are the two most highly criticized anti-
trust rules. They are criticized because they usually prevent firms
from lowering prices.

  Judge Breyer also reversed the district court's dismissal of the
Robinson-Patman Act claim. So the result in this case was that
Judge Breyer has allowed Caribe to complain that it is being pre-
vented from selling BMWs at lower prices to some of its customers
and simultaneously being prevented from selling BMWs at a high-
er price to some of its customers. The context, timing, and result
in this case exemplifies a degree of opportunism and cynicism
which is disturbing.

  I hope that the concerns raised by Senator Metzenbaum and the
concerns voiced here may have some small effect on the way Judge
Breyer approaches these vitally important cases in the future.

  Thank you very much, Senator.

                              PREPARED STATEMENT OF LLOYD CONSTANTINE

  Chairman Biden and members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity
to testify again, in this instance concerning the nomination of Judge Stephen Breyer
to be an Associate Judge of the United States Supreme Court.
                               531

  I am an antitrust litigator who represents plaintiffs and defendants including
"Fortune 500" companies, small firms and groups of consumers.1 I teach Antitrust
Law at Fordham University School of Law. I have served as New York State's chief
antitrust enforcer,2 Chairman of the Task Force which coordinates antitrust enforce-
ment for all 50 states,3 Chairman of the New York State Bar Association's Antitrust
Law Committee and as member of the Council of the American Bar Association Sec-
tion of Antitrust Law.

  I have devoted my professional career to antitrust law because I believe that
along with civil rights and liberties, antitrust is at the center of our free and pro-
gressive society and has been central in making the United States the strongest and
finest nation in the world.

  I oppose the nomination of Judge Breyer. I do so principally on the basis of his
antitrust jurisprudence. Given the fact that the Supreme Court typically renders
only two to four antitrust opinions each year, among more than 150 full opinions,
one might ask whether Judge Breyer's record in this area should be a substantial,
let alone predominant, concern of the Senate. I think it should for several reasons.

  Judge Breyer is a leading antitrust scholar and jurist who has written many im-
portant decisions interpreting our competition laws. I believe a sober and dis-
passionate understanding of the way Judge Breyer approaches his role as a judge
in antitrust cases is crucial to understanding his overall approach to the role of the
judiciary in our society.

  Antitrust law still has the capacity to be what the Supreme Court said it was,
that is, "the Magna Carta of free enterprise."4 However, antitrust is not that corner-
stone of economic freedom today, because recent administrations and the federal ju-
diciary have openly disregarded the explicit purpose and meaning of the antitrust
laws, and reinterpreted them in accordance with one extremely narrow view of neo-
classical price theory. Antitrust has been trivialized in     wehcoant otmheicss,c"h5oalarpaFcrtedwehriicchk
Rowe has termed "The Faustian pact between law and
has spread beyond competition law into the interpretation of environmental law and
even the law of civil rights and civil liberties.

  Antitrust scholars and practitioners widely recognize Judge Breyer to be, along
with Judges Bork, Posner and Easterbrook, the mayor jurists revising and reinter-
preting the antitrust laws according to one school of economic thought. Please allow
me to illustrate. In July 1990 I testified before the Commerce, Science and Trans-
portation Committee concerning the capacity of antitrust law to address the problem
of international trade predation. I told Senators Gorton and Bryan that the anti-
trust laws had little deterence or remedial value for this problem because they had
been reduced to trivial laws primarily concerned with a trivial debate about a little
triangle, which I offered to draw for the Committee. Two months later, Judge
Breyer actually drew that triangle in his opinion in Town of Concord v. Boston Edi-
son,6 while reversing a $39 million verdict for Senator Kennedy's constituents in
Concord and Wellesley, Massachusetts. In his colloquy with Senator Metzenbaum
on Tuesday, Judge Breyer repeatedly stated that he nullified the jury verdict in
order to lower electricity prices to all consumers in Massachusetts. This is clearly
not the case. Town of Concord involved a "price squeeze" which occurs when a
power company sells electricity at a wholesale price which is just below, at, or some-
times above the price of which it sells electricity at retail. The remedy for this pred-
atory and exclusionary practice, first exhaustively analyzed by Judge Learned Hand
in the landmark Alcoa decision,7 is not, as Judge Breyer suggested, to raise retail
prices but to lower wholesale prices. This would have the dual benefit of lowering
all prices and increasing competition at the retail level.

  More disturbing than the narrow result reached in Town of Concord, and the dis-
ingenuous manner in which Judge Breyer responded to Senator Metzenbaum's ques-
tions about his decision, is Judge Breyer's mode of analysis in this lengthy opinion.
On Tuesday Judge Breyer stated that he decided cases "one at a time" and that he
didn't "like to be professorial." Please Senators, read Town of Concord and judge for
yourselves. In this decision Judge Breyer expounds on many issues and cases not
before the court. Although Town of Concord involved what Judge Breyer considers
the distinct case of a price squeeze in a fully regulated industry, Judge Breyer went

to great lengths to call into question the settled law involving price squeezes in un-
regulated industries and to criticize the economic soundness and judicial admin-
istrability of Judge Hand's price squeeze analysis in Alcoa. Judge Breyer then went
on to unnecessarily expound the so-called "single monopoly profit" theory which
among neo-classical price theorists is an article of faith. According to this theory a
monopolist will earn as much profit in a single market as it would if it extended
its monopoly through leverage, or predation into a second market. The conclusions
which flow from this theory are several. One is that in most cases the antitrust law
should not care if a monopolist to do this in certain circumstances. Third, since the
monopolist won't make any greater profit by doing this, evidence that it has done
so is really just a mirage, for a rational monopolist would not try to extend its power
if it would not be profitable.

  Town of Concord sets forth a significant part of the agenda which Judge Breyer
has for cases which will come before him on the Supreme Court. His exposition of
the single monopoly profit theory strongly predicts that Judge Breyer will vote to
overrule established antitrust law in several cases. He will vote to overturn the per
se rule of illegality in tying cases, involving firms with market power in the typing
product. He will probably reject the rule against price squeezes in on-regulated in-
dustries. He will find that vertical mergers, which extend a dominant position from
one market to an upstream or downstream market is either competitively neutral
or pro-competitive. Finally, when the Supreme Court inevitably resolves the current
split in the circuits on whether monopoly leveraging constitutes a violation of Sec-
tion 2 of the Sherman Act, Judge Breyer will find that there is no violation.

  Judge Breyer's concern for the rights and prerogatives of lawful monopolists is a
constant theme in several of his antitrust decisions.

  For example, in Barry Wright Corp., v. ITT Grinnell Corp.,8 Judge Breyer found
that a monopolist who made shock absorbers for nuclear power plant construction
did not violate the antitrust laws. Judge Breyer found that the defendant had 94
percent of the market; it had introduced selective discounts of 25 percent to 30 per-
cent in response to the entry into the market of a new competitor; and it employed
contracts which required customers to buy their total estimated needs and further
required 100 percent forfeiture of the contract price upon cancellation. Taking the
alleged exclusionary acts one at a time, he ruled that none of them violated the anti-
trust laws. This piecemeal method of analysis avoided the logical conclusion that
acts which viewed separately as benign may collectively be extremely anticompeti-
tive. This is the lesson of Judge Hanas classic analysis of Alcoa's dominance of the
aluminum industry, which resulted from a series of practices which did not sepa-
rately violate the law, but which used together maintained a monopoly. An example
closer to Judge Breyer's home was Judge Wyzanski's classic decision in United
Shoe,9 where again a series of separately lawful actions were held to collectively
constitute acts of monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Judge
Wyzanski's famous statement in that case still resonates today: "the dominance of
any one enterprise inevitably unduly accentuates that enterprise's experience and
views as to what is possible, practical and desirable with respect to technological
development, research, relations with producers, employees, and customers. And the
preservation of any unregulated monopoly is hostile to the industrial and political
ideas of an open society founded on the faith that tomorrow will produce a better
than the best." This completely alien to Judge Breyer's antitrust jurisprudence,
which he articulates as a concern about lower prices. However, over and over again
Judge Breyer looks to monopolists or dominant firms to produce lower prices, a no-
tion which is both economically counter intuitive, and more important, contrary to
the basic purpose of the antitrust laws.

  Before leaving Barry Wright, I would point out that in that decision, once again,
Judge Breyer reached out to decide cases not yet before his Court. In Barry Wright,
the plaintiff challenged as predatory, prices which were above the defendants' aver-
age total costs, a situation which almost all antitrust scholars, judges and practi-
tioners, I among them, would consider lawful and non-predatory. (Leaving aside the
issue of the syncrgistic effect that this pricing had when used in combination with
the other exclusionary practices in that case.) But for no reason other than serving
a separate agenda, Judge Breyer went on to decide that prices that were below aver-
age total cost but above the producers incremental costs were also not predatory.
Recall what Judge Breyer told you Tuesday about the judge's duty to only decide
actual cases and controversies.

  Again in the Kartell10 case which Judge Breyer advanced as exemplifying his goal
of lowering prices, Judge Breyer nullified a district court finding that Blue Shield,
with a 74 percent share of the relevant health insurance market, did not violate the
antitrust laws by adopting a ban on "balance billing," which effectively fixed the
prices received by virtually all Massachusetts physicians accepting Blue Shield pa-
tients. I believe that Judge Breyer honestly believes that he did the right thing in
that case, and he believes once again a monpolist can be counted on to deliver lower
prices. What is totally missing from this decision, and indeed missing from all of
Judge Breyer's decisions, is healthy skepticism about the long-term benefits of mo-
nopoly power, a skepticism which is the very core of the Sherman Act. Also missing
is any recognition of just how high and out of control were healthcare prices in an
environment characterized by dominant rather than competing third party payers.
Also missing from the decision is any concern for the quality of healthcare which
may be a paramount concern in this area. Antitrust not only demands low prices
but high quality. Indeed, to illustrate his method in Kartell, Judge Breyer resorts
to an analogy about the buyer of a fleet of taxicabs11 and observes that if Blue
Shield's practices were truly anticompetitive, there would not be a steadily increas-
ing supply of doctors in Massachusetts.12 If you don't understand the logic of this
supply and demand argument, equating the purchase of healthcare with purchase
of a fleet of cabs, please refer to Judge Breyer's diagram at Appendix B of his opin-
ion in Town of Concord. Judge Breyer is undoubtedly a brilliant, good and honest
man, but much of the real world and real marketplace is alien to him. One of the
reasons many people voted for President Clinton was his pledge to appoint to the
Supreme Court, people with a broader background. Broader than people like Judge
Breyer who have gone from law school to clerkship, to law faculty to the Court, with
a segue to position with this Committee. I fear that the narrow ideological focus that
Judge Breyer has demonstrated consistently in his antitrust opinions will typify his
approach to other areas of the law, when as a Supreme Court Justice he is con-
strained only by his own sense of what is logical and economically efficient.

  The last case I will address is Judge Breyer's March 1994 decision in Caribe
BMW,13 when for the first time in his career he found for a plaintiff in an antitrust
case. This decision in my opinion is the most disturbing of all of Judge Breyer's rul-
ings. Only Judge Breyer knows whether this dramatic turnabout in antitrust ideol-
ogy and mode of analysis was motivated by the wisely known fact that he was under
consideration for the next seat on the High Court.

   Caribe BMW involved a car dealer in Puerto Rico which complained that it was
victimized by two violations of the antitrust laws. First, it said it was the victim
of price discrimination violative of the Robinson-Patman Act. Caribe said that BMW
sold cars to other dealers at a lower price than it received. Caribe also claimed that
BMW was trying to lower Caribe's retail prices by engaging in maximum vertical
price fixing. It is true that maximum vertical price fixing violates the law. However,
Judge Bryer stretched as hard for the plaintiff, as he traditionally does for the de-
fendant, to find a plausible violation of the law here. It is also true that the rule
against maximum vertical price fixing is one of the two most highly criticized anti-
trust rules. It is criticized because it often prevents firms from lowering prices,
which Judge Breyer articulates as the antitrust laws' appropriate core concern. Sen-
ator Metzenbaum will not that his bill to codify the per se rule against vertical price
fixing has never included the maximum vertical price fixing offense.

   In Caribe, Judge Breyer also reversed the district court's dismissal of the Robin-
son-Patman Act claim. Robinson-Patman is the other of the two most highly criti-
cized provisions of antitrust, again because it allegedly raises prices. To sustain the
Robinson-Patman claim, Judge Breyer had to break new ground, applying, I believe
correctly, the rule of the Copperweld14 case to the Robinson-Patman Act. The result
tin this case was that Judge Breyer has allowed Caribe to complain that it is being
prevented from selling BMWs at a low price to some of its customers because of
price discrimination and simultaneously being prevented from selling BMWs at a
higher price to some of its customers because of maximum vertical price fixing. The
context, tuning and result in this case exemplifies a degree of cynicism which is dis-
turbing.

  Judge Breyer will be confirmed. I hope that the concerns raised by Senator
Metzenbaum and the concerns voiced here may have some small effect on the way
he approaches these vitally important cases in the future.

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Estes.

                            STATEMENT OF RALPH ESTES

  Mr. ESTES. Senator Hatch, Senator DeConcini, Senator Specter,
I know there is important business occupying the Senate today, but
I do wish that more members of the committee had the opportunity
to hear the testimony of this panel, because coming late though it
does in the hearings, it is very important testimony for the future
of this country. And I do appreciate the opportunity to testify.

  My testimony is based entirely on my reading of Judge Breyer's
writings. I do not know the gentleman. I do not even know if I have
seen him. His writings on the surface present an appearance of ob-
jectivity. They conceal much, but as you read them in the aggre-
gate, they reveal much.

  Throughout his writings, you can see in Judge Breyer an alle-
giance to business and corporations that could, through his opin-
ions as a Supreme Court Justice, do great harm to our citizens and
to our Nation. He asserts he does not favor complete deregulation,
but he does want to free corporations from regulatory constraints,
and he believes that in many more cases the market will appro-
priately constrain corporate behavior, if, indeed, as he seems to
doubt, it needs much constraining.

  Judge Breyer's ideas on corporate regulation are grounded in an
erroneous free-market view of social costs. In this marketplace of
Judge Breyer's, there is no distinction between corporations and
people. To the judge, the Disney Corp. and the homeowner in Ma-
nassas, VA, are equal players in the economic arena, as are a
woman who may have needed silicone breast implants and the Dow
Corning Co.

  In his economic calculus, the following are mathematically equal:
On the one hand, a healthy, undamaged, whole child; on the other
hand, a brain-damaged child, brain-damaged for life from a hot
dose of DPT vaccine who has been awarded $25 million or whose
family has been awarded $25 million to pay for round-the-clock
care for the rest of that child's life. Those are economically equiva-
lent in Judge Breyer's economic calculus.

  Judge Breyer would prefer not to direct corporations to behave
responsibly. Instead, he favors tax breaks and marketable, special
rights, such as pollution rights, to try to get them to behave re-
sponsibly. Put in more down-to-earth terms, what he is talking
about is bribing corporations to keep them from doing harm.

  In this kind of approach, Judge Breyer, I am afraid, fails to show
a real understanding of the historical basis in this country for char-
tering corporations. A good study of history would show him that
corporations were created in the first place as servants of the peo-
ple and of the society, and that a corporate charter is a grant of
special privilege, conveyed by the people through their State, in ex-
pectation of benefits to society.

  If Judge Breyer knew this history, I think he would support a
public policy that demands that corporations behave responsibly in
the first place, instead of one that tries to get them to do good--
                                             535

be good, rather, by giving them tax breaks and special pollution
rights that they can then sell.

  Much of what Judge Breyer says about regulatory reform, of
course, I would support, particularly with respect to regulations
adopted at the instigation of industry to limit competition--truck-
ing, bank CD interest rates--and also his arguments for greater
corporate disclosure, very much needed. But beneath his scholarly
tone, Judge Breyer's writings convey an antagonism to any but the
most unavoidable constraints on corporations, a near reverence for
business and corporations as adjudicator of social well-being and of
social policy. In the aggregate, Judge Breyer's writings present a
pattern of prejudice, almost of disdain, against arguments, re-
search, and theories that support the protection of the public
through limitations on abusive corporate actions, while he shows a
symmetrical sympathy for theories and research that support
hands-off deregulation. Judge Breyer's writings do not suggest a
mind-set of judicious objectivity.

  He manifests in the aggregate in his writings an aversion toward
restriction of those corporate actions that do harm to workers and
the public. Collectively, his writings reveal a preference for a lais-
sez-faire role for Government that has been rejected in this country
since the excesses of the robber barons in the last century. He ap-
pears to have little awareness of the aggregate cost of the harm
done to society by corporate America, a cost I have estimated else-
where at over $2.5 trillion a year.

  Judge Breyer and corporate America may want the marketplace
to adjudicate workplace safety, toxic emissions, dangerous prod-
ucts. But the effects that kind of prescription would have on many,
especially on the poor and those less fortunate in our society is sim-
ply too brutal to be acceptable. We have learned the lessons of as-
bestos, of Love Canal, tobacco, the Dalkon Shield, BCCI, GM's side-
saddle gas tanks.

  Of course, as others, including members of this panel, have
noted, one of the strongest measures of Judge Breyer's devotion to
big business is his stunning record and 16 and 0 in antitrust cases.
Now, just think about it statistically. That kind of record says that
either Judge Breyer in his court received an incredible sequence of
16 consecutive, ill-conceived cases without merit, or else his deci-
sions reflect a closed mind and a personal antagonism to antitrust
enforcement.

  If you had a population of more or less evenly divided cases, the
probability of this, against this, is 65,536 to 1. Now statistical im-
probability alone does not prove a bias. I know that. But the Wall
Street Journal is satisfied. They said, "This is one of the few areas
where"--and I emphasize--"the nominee appears to have made up
his mind." And they add, "He agrees with much of the agenda pro-
moted by Reagan administration officials."

  To wrap up, Senator Biden said this morning that Judge Breyer
presents incredible credentials. I do not argue with that. But cre-
dentials are not all that matter. More important is what Judge
Breyer's position on the Supreme Court will mean for the country.

  Judge Breyer has shown through his writings and through his
record that as a Supreme Court Justice he will be disposed to rule
in favor of corporations against the people and to dismiss regula-

       85-742 - 95 - 18
536  x

tion designed to protect the environment and human health and
safety in favor of a hypothetical free-market discipline.

  Gentlemen, if a nominee came before this committee with a
record of siding with the defendant and rejecting every civil rights
claim heard by him in 14 years, what would you do? You would re-
ject that nominee out of hand, not only because of his clearly hos-
tile attitude toward civil rights, but because you would not place
someone on the Supreme Court with such a closed mind on an
issue of fundamental importance to our society.

  In his writings, Judge Breyer has shown a favoritism to cor-
porate interests over those of the people, a lack of empathy for the
poor and less fortunate in our society, and an autocratic view of
policymaking and an unusual, at best, interpretation of the U.S.
Constitution. If Judge Breyer's writings are a guide to the way he
will act as a Supreme Court Justice, gentlemen, then the public
will ultimately suffer for the sake of corporate profits. More people
will become ill. More will be injured. More will suffer personal eco-
nomic loss. And some number will die.

  Articulate, arrogant, elitist, and too often wrong, a wolf in
sheep's clothing who will lead the Supreme Court in this area of
his special interest down a dangerous path that will be hazardous
to our health. The President and the American people would be
better served with a different nominee, one less loyal to corporate
interests.

  Thank you.

 The purpose of my testimony is to provide information that may assist the Committee
 in evaluating Judge Breyer's writings, opinions, and views on the corporate system and
 corporate regulation. My testimony is informed by three decades of research on
 corporations and regulations, and through service as expert witness on economic loss in
 numerous wrongful death and personal injury cases.

 I am a full professor of business administration at The American University, fellow at
 the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, author of eight books and over fifty
 scholarly academic articles. My doctorate is from Indiana University and I am a
 certified public accountant, formerly with Arthur Andersen & Co.

 Judge Breyer's writings give the surface appearance of objectivity. In these he is not
 prone to overt statements about his personal views, and after extensive reading one is
 left unaware of his views on many matters of public concern.

 But in certain areas his views are revealed quite clearly. Just as an individual's
 positions and preferences become more evident through the totality of their actions
 than in singular assertions, so too are Judge Breyer's views concerning corporations and
 regulation cogently disclosed in the consistent bent reflected in the accumulation of his
 writings. These reveal that:

         · Judge Breyer demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the role of
             the corporate system in American society, and the historical basis of corporate
             chartering: the granting of special privileges to private entities in expectation
             of public benefit.1

         · His ideas on corporate regulation are grounded in an erroneous "market" view
             of social costs, or "spillovers."2

         · In his writings Judge Breyer sets out to teach others about the applicability of
             statistical and mathematical theory in regulatory discourse, but he reflects an
             insufficient understanding that results in his misuse of the mathematics and
             statistics he attempts to apply.3

          · Judge Breyer's conception of public policymaking reflects an autocratic,
             undemocratic, and elitist view, as well as an unusual, perhaps even a unique,
             understanding of the U.S. Constitution/

          · Judge Breyer's writing demonstrates a lack of empathy for the poor and for
             lower income workers and families.5

                           Should Corporations be Favored Over People?

Throughout his writings Judge Breyer evinces an allegiance to business and corporations
that could, through his opinions as a Supreme Court justice, do great harm to our
citizens and our nation. And while asserting that he is not for complete deregulation,
he wants to free corporations from regulatory constraints and believes that in many
more cases the market will appropriately constrain corporate behavior - if indeed, as
he seems to doubt, it needs constraining.

Judge Breyer would prefer not to direct corporations to behave responsibly; he instead
favors tax breaks and marketable rights to induce socially-responsible behavior. "A
more feasible method [than postulating rules] would combine fairly simple rules with
economic incentives such as tax breaks or marketable rights."' With respect to
externalities or spillovers such as pollution, noise, dirt, and waste, Judge Breyer believes,
"Classical regulation is not able to deal comprehensively with spillover problems. Taxes,
marketable rights, and even bargaining are likely to prove useful as substitutes or
supplements."7

Judge Breyer's approach seeks to bribe corporations to keep them from doing harm.
He apparently fails to recognize that a corporate charter, under which most business
activity is conducted, is a special grant of privilege conveyed by the people, through the
state, in expectation of benefits to society. If Judge Breyer understood more about the
origin of the corporate system, he would support a public policy that demands that
corporations behave responsibly in the first place, instead of a policy that seeks to
induce responsible behavior by giving corporations tax breaks and special rights to be
sold.8

Much of what Judge Breyer says about regulatory reform I would support. He is on
target, for example, when he observes that each action bears a cost, and there may be
better actions we could take for the same cost; or that we should take a systemic
approach to regulation that considers harm that may be caused elsewhere by a
regulation designed to do good. And his skepticism is likely justified with respect to
regulations adopted at the instigation of industry to limit competition - trucking, bank
CD interest rates - although not with respect to regulations that protect the public.

 There is a prevalent, underlying philosophy beneath the scholarly tone in Judge Breyer's
 writing, however, that conveys an antagonism to any but the most unavoidable
 constraints on corporations, a near-adulation of business and corporations as adjudicator
 of social well-being and of social policy. In the aggregate Judge Breyer's writings
 present a pattern of prejudice, almost of disdain, against arguments, research, and
 theories that support the protection of the public through limitations on abusive
 corporate actions; and a symmetrical sympathy for theories and research that support
 laissez faire deregulation.' Judge Breyer's writings suggest the ardor of the religious
 convert, except in this case it was conversion to the religion of economic theory ~ albeit
 a misinformed theory, as articulated by Judge Breyer.10 His writings do not suggest a
 mindset of judicious objectivity.

 Judge Breyer's enthusiasm for economic theory is reflected in his emphasis on economic
 efficiency rather than equity. He accepts the propriety of "classical" regulation if it
 reduces "allocative inefficiency."" He does not speak of regulation being required to
 achieve equity and fairness, to save lives or prevent crippling injuries, to protect those
 whose economic resources are such that "allocative efficiency" is meaningless. At least
 in his writings prior to this nomination, these were not the terms of Judge Breyer's
 vocabulary. As one reviewer observed, "If presidents and Congresses ignore Judge
 Breyer's prescription for regulatory reform, it will result from their disagreement with
the proposition that economic efficiency is the sole objective of government regulation

Several have noted Judge Breyer's record of consistently finding for corporate
defendants in antitrust cases. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for example, reported that
"Breyer voted against antitrust claims more often than the most conservative appointees
of President Ronald Reagan."13 George Mason University law professor William
Kovacic is reported to have found that Judge Breyer voted 100% of the time on the
side of big business in antitrust cases." Charles Mueller observed in Legal Times that:
                                         540

         Breyer's antitrust decisions display one especially conspicuous principle: The
         corporate defendant always wins, no matter how egregious the challenged
         conduct. He has never met a monopoly or a restraint on competition that he
         didn't like, ruling for the big-business defendant 16 times in the 16 antitrust
         decisions he wrote during his 14 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st
         Circuit. . . The result is that Breyer has effectively repealed the federal antitrust
         laws in his four-state (plus Puerto Rico) jurisdiction."15

Now I am not a lawyer, but just considered statistically it would appear from this record
that either Judge Breyer's court received an astounding sequence of sixteen consecutive
ill-conceived cases without merit, or else his decisions reflect a personal predisposition
that is antagonistic to antitrust enforcement.

Of course statistical improbability alone does not prove a bias, but The Wall Street
Journal is satisfied: 'This is one of the few areas where the nominee appears to have
made uj> hjs mind. He agrees with much of the agenda promoted by Reagan
administration officials who staffed the Justice Department and federal courts with
opponents of aggressive antitrust enforcement."" [emphasis mine] Business Week
draws a similar conclusion: "He is skeptical of government interference in markets and
sympathetic to defendants in antitrust cases."17

Skeptical of government interference in markets indeed. Judge Breyer has stated that,
with respect to air and water pollution, "the essential problem is that the price of a
product made by means of a polluting process does not reflect the harm that the
resulting pollution causes."18 He does not say that the essential problem is that
peoples' health, their property values, and their quality of life are damaged. His
writings suggest that it would be acceptable for a manufacturer of industrial chemicals
to poison a neighborhood as long as its prices were made, through taxes, to be high
enough to reflect these social costs. He does not reveal a concern for preventing the
damage done, against the will of the families and communities harmed, in the first
place.

Judge Breyer admits that federal regulation has reduced the number of auto deaths,
and that the environment is clearly cleaner ("in some parts of the country"), but he
thinks that whether these effects are worth the cost "is open to debate." Here, as
elsewhere, his concern is with cost to business, not cost to those who suffer the harm.19

But, by and large, it is not Judge Breyer's individual statements that especially cause
concern. It is the continued repetition of emphasis on cost to the corporation without a
balanced attention to harm to the public.20

Judge Breyer manifests, taking his writings in the aggregate, an aversion toward
restriction of those corporate actions that do harm to workers and the public.
Collectively, his writings reveal a preference for a laissez-faire role for government that
has been rejected in American society since the rise of the giant corporation and the
excesses of the Robber Barons in the last century. He appears to have little awareness
of the aggregate cost of the harm done to society by Corporate America, a cost I have
estimated elsewhere at over $2.5 trillion each year.

Judge Breyer and Corporate America may want the marketplace to adjudicate
workplace safety, toxic emissions, and dangerous products, but the effects such a
prescription would have on many, especially the poor and those who are weaker, is
simply too brutal to be acceptable to the vast majority of Americans. The Congress
and the American people have rejected that approach. We have learned the lessons
taught by asbestos, Love Canal, the tobacco companies, the Dalkon Shield, silicone
breast implants, BCCI, the Exxon Valdez, Times Beach, the Ford Pinto, GM's
sidesaddle gas tanks.
                                           541

                                                     Summary

  We have heard repeatedly that Judge Breyer has superb qualifications to sit on the
  Supreme Court. But we know that qualifications - IQ, academic degrees, a full
  curriculum vita - are not all that matter.

  If a nominee came before this Committee with a record of siding with the defendant
  and rejecting every civil rights claim heard by him in 14 years on the Court of Appeals,
  this Committee would not, I am sure, vote to confirm -- not only because of his clearly
  hostile attitude toward civil rights, but because you would not accept such a closed mind
  on an issue that reaches to the heart and the spirit of our society.

  Judge Breyer, as we know, sided with the defendant in every antitrust case that came
  before him in 14 years on the Court of Appeals. In so doing he manifests an
  antagonism to Congress's efforts to restrain the ever-expanding power of colossal
  corporations, and so to hold large corporations accountable to the public responsibility
  inherent in their publicly granted charters.

 As you review the record of these hearings I would urge that you not focus on detailed
  incidents such as a failure to pay taxes for domestic help, or a possible conflict of
  interest in rulings on matters that conceivably could have affected his potential financial
  liability on Lloyd's of London investments. I would urge you to ask instead: What will
  it mean for the country to have this nominee on the U. S. Supreme Court. Judge
  Breyer has shown, through his writings and through his record, that as a Supreme Court
 justice he will be disposed to rule in favor of corporations against the people, to reject
 appropriate restraint on corporate power, to dismiss regulation designed to protect the
 environment and human health and safety in favor of a hypothetical "free market"
  discipline.

  If Judge Breyer acts on the Supreme Court in a manner that is consistent with the
  preponderance of his public writings, the public will ultimately suffer for the sake of
  corporate profits. More will become ill, more will be injured, more will suffer personal
 economic loss -- and some number will die.

 The President and the American people would be better served with a different
  nominee - one less loyal to corporate interests.

                                                     Notes

1. In his writings Judge Breyer generally draws no distinction between corporations and
people. To the judge the Disney corporation and a homeowner in Manassas are equal
players in the economic arena, as are General Motors and a farmer in Oklahoma
buying a pickup truck with sidesaddle gas tanks, or a woman who needed silicone
breast implants and the Dow Corning Company.

        Overall his writings show little understanding of the aggregate power of large
corporations:

     - Government can invoke the death penalty and take us to war, but Corporate
        America is responsible for far more deaths than government. From 1973
        through 1991, 1,529 people died from the death penalty and military action
         combined; during that same period 156 times as many workers, a total of
                                          542

         239,300, died on the job at the hands of industry. An additional untold number
         of people died from industrial pollution, poisonous food and medicine, and
         dangerous appliances, equipment, and vehicles. (Statistical Abstract of the
         United States 1985. Table 712; Statistical Abstract of the United States 1989,
         Tables 326, 547, 680; Statistical Abstract of the United States 1992. Table 665;
         National Safety Council, August 1993)
     - Corporations control 84% of nongovernment payroll, 67% of total payrolls
     - Corporate receipts and spending are more than 10 times as great as the federal
         government's (Statistical Abstract of the United States 1992. Table 492, "Federal
         Receipts, by Source: 1980 to 1992.").
     - Corporations control our culture, from the media to entertainment to advertising
         to taste. A typical child sees 22,000 commercials a year, an average of over 400
         a week -- some 350,000 commercials by age 18, and virtually all presented in
         pursuit of private profit. (Robert M. Liebert. "Effects of Television on Children
         and Adolescents." Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics. February 1986, pp.
         43-48)
     - Ranked by their revenues, the larger corporations nest snugly among the larger
         countries of the world. Several multinational corporations command resources
         greater than the tax revenues of such developed nations as Switzerland,
         Denmark, and Austria (Statistical Abstract of the United States 1990. Table
         1456, and Fortune. April 24, 1989, p. 354.), not to mention the hundreds of
         smaller countries. In their ability to affect lives through expenditure of funds,
         the largest corporations are more powerful than most countries.
     - "The fact that . . . government activities are highly visible, in comparison with
         those of the corporation, has led to the notion that the prime exercise of social
         control is done by government. On the contrary, so long as investment decisions
         are made by the corporations, the locus of social control and coordination must
         be sought among them; government fills the interstices left by these prime
         decisions." (Harry Braverman, Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation
         of Work in the Twentieth Century. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1974, pp.
         268-9)
As Professor Galbraith has said, "The truly giant corporations . . . are independent
republics of their own management."

2. Breyer's "market" view of externalities is wrong, in two ways: he sums interpersonal
utilities, equating a 1 cent cost saving by a sugar producer with a 1 cent reduction in
price to sugar buyers - ignoring that pollution sufferers aren't exactly or necessarily the
same persons as the sugar buyers. He fails to properly match up the bearers of the
costs and the recipients of the benefits. This was the problem with Ford's Motor
Company's use of cost-benefit analysis on moving the Pinto's gas tanks ~ and numerous
other regulatory uses of cost-benefit analysis. [Regulation and Its Reform, p. 23]

         In Judge Breyer's economic calculus these are mathematically equal: a child that
is brain-damaged for life from a "hot" batch of DPT vaccine, whose parents receive a
$25 million award for around-the-clock care, vs. a child that is undamaged, whole.

         When applied outside the domain of business, Judge Breyer's "free market" views
would sanction arguments against the "regulation" of street muggings and assaults, on
the grounds that such assaults are an economically efficient means of achieving resource
distribution. He has shown an unwillingness to apply or extend the criminal and
regulatory sanctions we impose on individual behavior, to the often much more harmful
behavior of corporations.

         Judge Breyer lays down what he sees as criteria for regulation of spillovers or
social costs. If his criteria are met, he says regulation can then "reduce allocative
inefficiency." He does not speak of equity. He does not speak of innocent neighbors,
communities, workers wrongfully harmed. He does not conclude that, under his criteria,
regulation will save lives and protect communities. It will reduce allocative inefficiency.
[Regulation and Its Reform, p. 26]
                                         543

         He continues: before regulation should reverse an apparently sanctified "market-
made decision," the social cost should meet certain criteria, one of which is that it be
large. A plant that damages a few lives, reduces the value of a few homes, causes only
some misery, should not be regulated. The damage must be "large." What would
Judge Breyer tell these few affected workers, customers, neighbors? Sorry?
Presumably he would accept regulating the behavior of a single murderer. But when
the harm is done by business, by corporations, it must be a "large" harm to warrant
interference with the "free market." [Regulation and Its Reform, p. 26]

         Speaking of spillovers (or external diseconomies, social costs ~ uncompensated
costs imposed on those outside the company) caused by products, in this case sugar
production that "sends black smoke billowing throughout the neighborhood," Judge
Breyer says that, with regulation of this smoke, "those who suffer pollution are made
richer." This is the sterile, technocratic economist approach to pollution. Judge Breyer
does not say, "those who suffer pollution are made whole" or "are restored to their
previous undamaged condition." His focus, his thinking, is purely on an economic
calculus with no evident (in this instance) thought about equity, about fairness, about
who was wrongfully damaging whom in the first place. No, to Judge Breyer pollution
regulation makes the sufferer of pollution richer. [Regulation and Its Reform, p. 25]

         As Professor Sheila Jasanoff, professor of science policy, chair of the Dept. of
Science and Technology Studies at Cornell Univ., and author of books on risk
management and on science policy, has noted "Judge Breyer's view of what constitutes
an efficient market is hopelessly wrong."

3. Judge Breyer equates certainty with expected value in examples about soldiers and
escape routes (a probability-weighted expected value of 400 lives lost ~ 1/3 prob. that
all will be saved, 2/3 prob. that all will die ~ is not the same as certainty that 400 lives
will be lost, since in the first instance there is a reasonable chance that all will be saved
(and a larger chance that all will die), whereas in the second 400 will die and 200 will
live, for sure. Judge Breyer is ignoring utility functions, as he also does in his market-
based solutions to pollution. He knows part of the mathematics and arrogantly
criticizes the public for not knowing as much ("people do not understand the
counterintuitive consequence of certain important statistical propositions.") [Breaking the
Vicious Circle, p. 36-37].

         He thes speaks of "deviation toward the mean" (he means regression toward the
mean, or that the mean of the sampling error approaches zero as more and more
samples are drawn). He uses this concept erroneously, confusing the difference
between mean test scores of the group and mean scores for an individual. In an
example the judge says an individual who scores high on one test will most likely do
worse on the next. In fact, an individual who scores high on one test will most likely,
ceteris paribus, score high on the next test. But a group that scores well above its
norm, or mean, will most likely score lower as a group on the next test. Judge Breyer
then observes, "The statistical deviation toward the mean is positively reinforcing the
teacher's negative reinforcement, and negatively reinforcing the positive reinforcement."
[Breaking the Vicious Circle, p. 37]

4. Judge Breyer proposes an administrative superagency that would rule over
regulatory agencies, by taking policy and budget power away from elected
representatives and placing it in the hands of insulated bureaucrats] He says it must
have "interagency jurisdiction" to "bring about needed transfers of resources." Congress,
one assumes, can just go home. He wants his superagency to have a degree of
"political insulation" to withstand political pressures "that emanate from the public
directly or through Congress or other political sources" (Breaking the Vicious Circle, p.
60).

        ". . . one important objective is to limit the extent to which public debate about
a particular substance determines the regulatory outcome. . ." Context is that he wants
                                         544

decisions made on basis of expert analysis, not public pressure, but he shows little
concern for the danger of excluding public input (Breaking the Vicious Circle, p. 78).
(He also says his superagency proposal is a counter to arguments for deregulation;
Breaking the Vicious Circle, p. 80.)

         In "Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy," Administrative Law
Review, v. 38 (Fall 1986), pp. 363-398, Judge Breyer cites admiringly France's Conseil
d'Etat as a model for this superagency that would review and change regulations and
reallocate funds among programs; he admires the facts that the Conseil "is not bound
by the strictures of the adversary system," presents its results "without being confined to
a formal record," is able to conduct its deliberations in private without counsel present
(pp. 396-97). His superagency would directly affect national policy, yet he likes the idea
of a "nonpolitical" body shielded from public input and public scrutiny. [In Breaking
the Vicious Circle it is clear that the Conseil doesn't have the resource-reallocation
power Breyer wants his superagency to have.] Then after pages of admiration for this
French approach, he assures us that his article does not endorse any approach
discussed (p. 397).

        Judge Breyer says this his proposal is likely to engender objections that it sounds
undemocratic and elitist, and then (p. 74) summarily dismisses this charge as not an
argument but merely a pejorative label

         Judge Breyer is proposing a superagency to reallocate budgetary funds among
competing programs, that would override or supercede Congress's constitutional
responsibility? This would appear to reflect an unusual, even unique, understanding of
the Constitution.

5. Judge Breyer's fondness for market solutions reflects a harshness, a lack of sympathy
or concern, for those without the means to adequately defend their rights and express
their needs in the marketplace (see Note 2 regarding his harsh allegiance to the justice
of the marketplace). Nowhere was I able to find any recognition that the marketplace
is a fine mechanism for resource allocation only as long as one has the financial
resources - is wealthy enough ~ to adequately express one's preferences. It is
analogous to a voting booth in which one votes with dollars, and those without the
dollars are disenfranchised. They do not have a vote in this kind of balloting on health
care, their workplace safety, or the pollution, noise, and odors dumped on them by a
chemical plant down the road.

         In his review of "Private Choices and Public Health: The AIDS Epidemic in an
Economic Perspective" by Tomas J. Philipson and Richard A. Posner (Harvard
University Press, 1994), in The New York Times Book Review. Judge Breyer says that
". . . [Society] has built a Social Security system around the concern that rational
individuals may not properly save for old age . . ." In writing that individuals may not
properly save for old age, instead of recognizing that they may, in fact, not be able to
save, Judge Breyer's writing suggests a lack of connection with, or sympathy for, the
poor and lower income workers and families - the ditch diggers, perhaps - who have
nothing to save. ["The nominee, in his own words: A 'mandate of equal justice under
law'," New York Times. May 15, 1994, 1, 30:1]

9. In this regard one notes his uniform rejection of antitrust complaints.
         One also notes his selectivity in presenting evidence related to his arguments.

Professor Jasanoff (see note 1) observed that Judge Breyer's Breaking the Vicious
Circle is "not in any sense a complete accounting of what is known about risk. He left
out a vast body of highly-respected research and analysis. He appeared unaware of 10
years of writing about risk. Perhaps he had formed his judgments already. Judge
Breyer displays advocacy behavior while cloaking his views in a veil of neutrality. He
may not even be aware of this behavior."

         Professor Jasanoff referred particularly to research reported during the 1980s
that indicate the average person integrates probabilities and risk factors more
completely than Breyer acknowledges. One can, of course, only speculate as to whether
Judge Breyer omits any mention of this research because it is counter to the position he
has adopted.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Professor.
  Before we move on, I have received a formal request from Mr.
Lloyd N. Cutler, special counsel to the President, to ask that a let-
ter directed to me be placed in the record, responding to what he
characterizes as a personal attack by Mr. Nader on him. I will
place it in the record and make it available to the press and the
public if they wish it.
  [The letter follows:]

                                                                                             THE WHITE HOUSE,

                                                                     Washington, July 15, 1994.

Hon. JOSEPH R. BIDEN,

Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.
  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Because Ralph Nader's testimony against the nomination

of Judge Breyer makes a personal attack on me, I respectfully ask permission to
file this reply for the record.

  Mr. Nader has made it a practice to advance his public policy views by demoniz-
ing some person or entity on the other side of the issue. Unfortunately for me, I
have long been one of his favorite targets.

  Mr. Nader asserts that the President's selection of Judge Breyer was tainted be-
cause of my position as a special government employee (SGE) serving as Special
Counsel to the President. Specifically, he contends that this status permits me to
evade "a number of conflict-of-interest and disclosure statutes."

  Before I undertook my current position, ethics officials in the White House and
the Office of Government Ethics thoroughly reviewed and cleared the proposed ar-
rangement. Consistent with the law and standards of conduct, I have disqualified
myself from any matters in which the firm is a party or represents a party, as well
as matters that would affect the financial interests of the firm. Moreover, contrary
to Mr. Nader's assertion, I have voluntarily taken a number of steps that go beyond
the requirements of the law, precisely because of my commitment to openness and
integrity in Government.

  For example, to ensure that my financial and client information is open to public
security, I have filed a public disclosure form which has been published in full in
the Legal Times, although only a more limited confidential form is required. Addi-
tionally, while I have chosen to serve without government compensation, I have also
arranged to have my salary from the law firm reduced to reflect the time I am de-
voting to government service. I have made this arrangement even though the law
applicable to volunteers and special government employees would permit me to re-
ceive my full salary from my law firm. Moreover, because I am no longer a member
of the firm, but rather a salaried Senior Counsel who will be paid only for the time
I work at the firm, I can take no "draw" from the law firm at the end of the year,
as Mr. Nader conjectures. I have also agreed to be bound, while in public service,
by the representational bar of 18 U.S.C. §205 as it applies to regular government
employees, even though special government employees have more limited restric-
tions. And not only will I adhere to the post-employment restrictions of the criminal
law, but I also have announced my intention to comply with President Clinton's Five
Year Ethics Pledge for Senior Appointees, which is not otherwise applied to special
government employees.

  Finally, the decision to nominate Judge Breyer was obviously the President's
alone. On Supreme Court nominations, the President solicits and receives advice
from many people, including his own staff, members of the Senate and private citi-
zens and groups speaking for every kind of public and private interest. My own ad-
vice was given in the spirit of public service and without any thought of personal
or financial advantage.

        Sincerely,

                                                                                              LLOYD N. CUTLER,

                                                              Special Counsel to the President.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would yield to Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. I have no questions for this panel, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Let me ask the panel, because it concerns me, of the testimony
I read of Mr. Nader and Mr. Estes. I did not read the other ones,
                                               547

but I heard some of them here, regarding Stephen Breyer's position
on antitrust. Let me just say this: Given that Breyer is only one
of a small part of a much larger structure which works to balance
the needs of consumers and business, Mr. Nader, how do you jus-
tify a statement that his presence on this Court will cause anti-
trust law enforcement to sink into a deeper moribund state?

  Mr. NADER. Well, I concede that if you believe it is already in a
moribund state, it might not sink any lower.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, do you believe it is in a moribund
state?

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. OK.
  Mr. NADER. And the reason why I say it will sink lower is be-
cause it adds not only an additional voice to the nonenforcement
of the antitrust laws, but an aggressive voice, and one, because of
his writings, would be entitled by people on the Court who agree
with him generically to considerable deference.
  Senator DECONCINI. Let me ask you this, then, and anyone else:
In answering questions from Senator Metzenbaum, Judge Breyer
indicated that he utilizes a three-part guideline when reviewing
complex or technical antitrust cases. In his view, antitrust is, first,
all about getting low prices for consumers; second, getting better
products for consumers; and, third, getting more efficient methods
of production.
  Now, my question is, is that not the proper standard for these
cases, and is there anything wrong in that standard?
  Do you want to start, Mr. Estes?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. May I start, Senator?
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes; go ahead.
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. That is not what antitrust is all about. Anti-
trust is all about what the Congress enacted in 1890 and 1914, and
in 1950, with the Seller-Kefauver amendments. Antitrust is about
industrial concentration; it is about preventing monopolies; it is
about maintaining small business; it is about a lot of political and
social ideals. On the next panel, you will have
  The CHAIRMAN. For what purpose?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. For the purpose of
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU just stated objectives, but for what purpose?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. One of the purposes, Senator, is to keep prices
low, but the question is whether low prices are derived by large,
efficient monopolists, or
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is the question, but the purpose is
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. One of the purposes.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. One of the purposes. What are some
of the other purposes? The question was what are the purposes--
not the posturing--what are the purposes?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. The purposes, Senator, were also to spread
out power in this country
  The CHAIRMAN. Right; good. That is an answer.
  Mr. CONSTANTINE [continuing]. To maintain small businesses
  The CHAIRMAN. For what purpose, though, to maintain small
businesses?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Because those were viewed as being goods in
and of themselves; because those were political ideals that were
                                               548

specifically adopted by the Congresses that passed both laws, Sen-
ator.

  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize for interrupting. Thank you.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  But having said what you just said, one of them, at least--lower
prices for consumers--you agree with?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Certainly; but Judge Breyer's decisions do not
point in that direction.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, I am not debating they are; I am just
defining a standard, first of all. Now, getting a better product--is
that a proper purpose? Is that a proper standard?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Absolutely, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. It is. And getting more efficient methods of
production?
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Certainly, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. NOW, given that, the Judge says that is his
standard, and you disagree that he has applied that standard.
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Yes, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. OK; that is what I wanted to get clarified,
because it seems to me that his standard, even though it was not
as in-depth as you think should be considered, he does have a
standard that he has put out there as a marker.
  So do the rest of the witnesses agree that this standard is not
an objectionable standard--it may not be everything that you want
but is a reasonable standard--first of all.
  Mr. NADER. Senator, it is crucially incomplete, because
  Senator DECONCINI. OK; but does it have some proper elements
from the standpoint of what antitrust is?
  Mr. NADER. But is misses the most important predicate, which
is to have an economic system that allows economic opportunity on
the part of small business, entrepreneurs and other entries, wheth-
er it is new technologies or a variety of businesses. Without that
market structure and market conduct, the other three purposes
that he posits will not likely to occur.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU mean you cannot get lower prices for
consumers or better products, and not have small business?
  Mr. NADER. If you do not have economic opportunity and new en-
tries
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, so
  Mr. NADER [continuing]. Because over time, you will get
oligopolist stagnation and monopolies.
  Senator DECONCINI. HOW will you get lower prices, better prod-
ucts for consumers, and not have more businesses? You would have
to have more businesses, wouldn't you?
  Mr. NADER. NO--yes, you would, but you see, he does not point
that out.
  Senator DECONCINI. NO, but that is his standard. Now, the fact
that you disagree on whether or not he has followed this stand-
ard
  Mr. NADER. Yes; his standard, Senator, are the fruits of a tree,
not watering its roots. And you have got to water your roots.
  Senator DECONCINI. But the point is he is not without some
sense--you may disagree with what that is--of what antitrust is.
And I may disagree with some of his decisions, and some of the
                                      549

ones you read to us, which I have not read, I would not agree with
the decision, either. But I do not think he is without at least a
standard that he applies. That is all I want to know.

  Now, Mr. Nader, in your statement, I believe, and in the media,
you have criticized Judge Breyer for being a follower of the Chicago
School of Economic Analysis, which emphasizes the importance of
the cost-benefit analysis in court decisions. The criticism continues,
although Judge Breyer has explicitly rejected that school's ap-
proach.

  So in your view, what is the proper role of economic analysis in
court decisions?

  Mr. NADER. In the antitrust area, or regulatory?
  Senator DECONCINI. Sure.
  Mr. NADER. In the antitrust area?
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Mr. NADER. The proper analysis starts with market structure,
market conduct, and then the results.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO there is a role of economic analysis in
court decisions.
  Mr. NADER. Of course, of course.
  Senator DECONCINI. OK.
  Mr. NADER. There is also a role for the structure of political con-
centration of industry, and that is what the Framers in 1890 and
the early 1900's made a big point of, that economic concentration
of power leads to political abuse, which leads to economic damage
to new entries, small business.
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you think that there is an economic role
in court decisions, antitrust or otherwise?
  Mr. NADER. Yes; the question is whose costs do you take into ac-
count, whose payments do you take into account.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, that is a question for a judge, right,
or a jury?

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Mr. ESTES. No, Senator, it is not. It is fundamental to the issue
of economics that Judge Breyer does not understand, if I could just
enter into this discussion. It is not just a question for a judge. If
someone is going to hold himself out as an expert on economics and
then misapply the very economics that he is trying to state

  Senator DECONCINI. Wait a minute. Who is holding himself out
as an expert on economics?

  Mr. ESTES. AS you read through the totality of Judge Breyer's
writings in the area of economics, or the near totality, as I have
done, there is an unmistakable image being presented by this per-
son as an expert on economics, on economic analysis in the applica-
tion of judicial decisions.

  Senator DECONCINI. Have you ever heard Judge Breyer state--
I have never heard him state or be held out as an expert in eco-
nomics or an expert on biotechnology or an expert on communica-
tions or an expert on the death penalty; have you?

  Mr. ESTES. Senator, Judge Breyer sees himself, as he reveals in
his writings, as an expert on economics, as also an expert on the
application of mathematical and statistical analysis and regulatory
matters.
                                               550

  Senator DECONCINI. He wrote a book in that area of regulatory
law.

  Mr. ESTES. More than one.
  Senator DECONCINI. More than one. I do not remember him writ-
ing a book on economics.
  Mr. ESTES. He imbues his book with references to economic the-
ory, and he is wrong in a good many places.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, he may be wrong, but I dispute that
he holds himself out as an expert. He is a judge, and he has had
economic cases. I have been a prosecutor, and I have prosecuted
people, but I am not an expert on the death penalty.
  Mr. ESTES. Senator, there is nothing for me to gain in arguing
with a prosecutor, but I would suggest that if you would read those
books in their entirety, you would come away with a view that
Judge Breyer believes himself and would like to have his colleagues
believe him to be an expert in economic analysis as applied to regu-
latory matters.
  Senator DECONCINI. Given that that is your interpretation and
that you think any reasonable person would come to this conclu-
sion, your position, then, Mr. Estes, is that this expert is wrong.
  Mr. ESTES. He is not wrong all the time, but he is wrong in very
serious matters.
  Senator DECONCINI. And because he is wrong in serious matters,
he is unqualified to be a Supreme Court Justice?
  Mr. ESTES. Senator, my place is not to cast a vote on whether
Judge Breyer sits on the Supreme Court. Of course, that is your
place. My role here is to try to offer helpful information to benefit
you in making that decision, and among the information that I
would offer to you is Judge Breyer's views on the regulation of mat-
ters like pollution. Let me just read something from his own words.
  He says if you have a sugar plant that is sending black smoke
billowing throughout a neighborhood, if we regulate that smoke,
those who suffer pollution are made richer.
  Judge Breyer does not say that those who suffer pollution are
made whole or are restored to their previous undamaged condition.
He says they are "made richer." That is a sterile, technocratic ap-
proach to pollution that does not understand the issue of economics
at stake here.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, Mr. Estes, I am grateful that you are
here to give us these suggestions and advice, but you did not an-
swer my question. First of all, if we take your assumption that he
is an expert on economics and if he differs on what you think prop-
er economics are, does that disqualify him to be a judge?
  Mr. ESTES. Senator, I am not casting a vote; that is for you to
do.
  Senator DECONCINI. I am not asking you to cast a vote. I am ask-
ing you for an opinion. Does that disqualify him to be a judge in
your opinion?
  Mr. ESTES. It would raise serious questions in my opinion about
seating him on the Supreme Court.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I take that as a yes.
  What about being on the circuit court? Do you think that would
disqualify someone from being on the circuit court?
  Mr. ESTES. I would have the same concern.
                                      551
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU would.
  Mr. Nader, let me ask you this. In a September 1993 article, the
New York Times indicated that health and safety regulations cost
Americans about $120 billion a year. Do you believe that Ameri-
cans are getting a maximum return on the enormous investment,
or is there room for improvement?
  Mr. NADER. Well, I do not know the source for that estimate un-
less it is Murray Wiedenbaum, who
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, let us go to the source. I only know
that it was stated in the New York Times, and I do not necessarily
take that as factual, either. Do you dispute that that is a correct
amount, or do you have a correct amount that you have some au-
thority on? Maybe you get the Wall Street Journal.
  Mr. NADER. I think the costs of regulation are negative. I think
they save far more money
  Senator DECONCINI. I am not asking about what they save. What
do you think they cost?
  Mr. NADER. The costs are negative because they save more than
they cost.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, let me put it this way
  Mr. NADER. The airbag, for example, saves billions of dollars of
health care costs, wage losses
  Senator DECONCINI. Let me just ask it this way, then, Mr.
Nader--I guess I did not get my question over to you, and I apolo-
gize for that--I am not asking what the offset is. What do you
think the out-of-pocket expenses are for the regulations--nr '.iat
they save or what can be calculated back in by not having jple
lose time from work or what-have-you--do you have any estimates?
  Mr. NADER. Other than the budgets of the regulatory agencies,
I have not seen a careful study because it is very hard to get costs
from industry that are objective and verifiable. So there has never
been a study that has been able to give the answer to your ques-
tion.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO you do not know; you do not know if $120
billion is a reasonable figure or not--not counting the offsets or the
benefits that are achieved by regulation?
  Mr. NADER. There is no reliable data to substantiate that figure.
  Senator DECONCINI. In terms of regulation, is it your position
that there is never a situation where the cost outweighs the bene-
fits?
  Mr. NADER. Certainly, I think the cost of the Federal courthouse
outweighs the benefits and could be put toward more access to jus-
tice by people in New England.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, is the courthouse, in your opinion, a
regulatory
  Mr. NADER. It is supported by taxpayers, which comes right
under Judge Breyer's intermodal analysis. He
  Senator DECONCINI. I understand where you are coming from,
but in terms of regulation, is the courthouse regulation--just the
courthouse building; is it regulation?
  Mr. NADER. It is part of the allocative inefficiencies that Judge
Breyer has talked about in other contexts.
                                              552

  Senator DECONCINI. In terms of regulations, is it your position
that there is never a situation where the costs outweigh the bene-
fits?

  Mr. NADER. Certainly, no--I will give you an example.
  Senator DECONCINI. Would you, please?
  Mr. NADER. Where you have regulation that ostensibly is to ad-
vance health and safety, but turns into a big, corporate, contract-
ing, pork-barrel boondoggle as the Superfund expenditures have,
you will get more money spent, with less return.
  Senator DECONCINI. More money spent, with less return.
  Mr. NADER. Right; but where you get regulation that focuses on
prevention rather than remediation or remedy, after the toxics are
at-large, you will get a maximal level of efficiency in terms of what
is spent and what is derived as a benefit. Taking lead out of gaso-
line has terrific consequence, especially for children's health. Air-
bags--terrific. Restricting vinyl chloride--terrific. This is where an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in monetary terms as
well as life-saving terms.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, in testimony before the committee,
Judge Breyer said many things, and one of them, let me read to
you, gentlemen.

  I do not count up how many victories are for plaintiffs or defendants and do sta-
tistics. What I am interested in, is the case correct as a matter of law, and I con-
sider the case, one at a time, and I consider the merits, the legal merits, of the argu-
ment in front of me.

  Can you provide me, any of you, with any basis other than your
dissatisfaction with his rulings for not believing that Judge
Breyer's statement is true and correct?

  Mr. NADER. Oh, sure.
  Senator DECONCINI. OK.
  Mr. NADER. First, I have introduced in the record a very critical
comment on his price squeeze case by Professor Carstensen at the
University of Wisconsin, just in anticipation of the question that
you have asked.
  And second, let me give one that is very understandable to most
consumers, Senator DeConcini. There was a case involving the
Subaru Corp. sued by a Subaru dealer in Massachusetts. The jury
rendered a verdict of over $50,000 for the Subaru dealer against
the Subaru Corp., plus attorney costs, fees, and costs.
  What was the complaint of the Subaru dealer? That the Subaru
Corp. was requiring the Subaru dealer to buy unwanted spare
parts in return for the Subaru dealer getting its proper allocation
of cars.
  Judge Breyer did not dispute the facts. He threw out the jury
verdict and overruled the trial court, saying that the reason he did
that was that Subaru did not amount to more than a minor per-
centage of the overall automotive market, and therefore, their tying
arrangement did not harm consumers.
  I ask you, how do you think the Subaru dealer is going to deal
with unwanted costs, that is unwanted spare parts, in treatment
of the consumers who come into that dealer's shop? He is going to
find a way to pass the costs on.
  This is an example of how, again and again, small distributors,
dealers, small Government entities, up against large corporations,
                                      553

in the 16 antitrust cases that the Judge decided, lost--again and
again, the giants won.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, but Mr. Nader, that is an interpreta-
tion you are making that Judge Breyer did not look at these cases
based on the law, or consider the cases one at a time, considering
only the merits, the legal merits. You disagree with his finding

   Mr. NADER. NO, no

  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Not that he did not look at
these factors.

  Mr. NADER [continuing]. No--he agreed with all the facts. He
said taking the facts as the lower judge and the jury found
them

  Senator DECONCINI. And a judge is not supposed to make a deci-
sion based on what he thinks is the law and the facts and the in-
terpretation?

  Mr. NADER. I do not think--and this is where Judge Breyer's ju-
dicial activism is going to be very apparent on the Supreme Court.
He threw out a jury verdict and overruled a court decision even
though he did not disagree with a single fact, and he did not dis-
agree with the connection of the fact to the law; where he disagreed
was his impression that it would not harm consumers because
Subaru was too small a company in the automotive market. That
is an extra-judicious assertion of what I think is impermissible ju-
dicial activism.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, now, Mr. Nader, you have been a prac-
ticing lawyer. Have you ever had a verdict thrown out by the court
that worked against your clients interest?

  Mr. NADER. NO, I have not.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU never have. Well, I have, and I really
did not like it; I really did not like it.
  Mr. NADER. But I do not think you are hearing me, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Oh, I am hearing you, I am hearing you.
  Mr. NADER. Judge Breyer agreed with the facts in the case. He
just said that he did not think Subaru was a big enough player so
that its tying arrangements harm consumers.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, that is his judgment as a judge. Now,
your testimony, Mr. Nader, paints a very dark future for the little
guy in the antitrust and regulatory arena. However, your testi-
mony seems to indicate that your discomfort with Judge Breyer's
views may stem from your overall concern that antitrust is moving
in a direction you do not support.
  Nonetheless, Mr. Nader, even if one assumes that your view of
Judge Breyer is correct--and I do not necessarily agree--isn't your
position overstated when you make statements like the following--
and I quote from your statement:

  The great questions of antitrust are no longer debated and studied. This basic
chapter of the free enterprise system has fallen into limbo beneath a counterattack
on all fronts by global corporations and their apologists who claim, with grotesque
caricature, that the antitrust laws interfere with U.S. global policy. Judges like Ste-
phen Breyer are picking over the leftover bones.

  Now, I have to question this "sky is falling" attitude, given that
Judge Breyer will be only one of nine Justices, all of whom are
independent thinkers and possess the intelligence not to be unduly
swayed by others. Furthermore, the Congress of the United States
                                      554

has not, in my judgment, abdicated authority to the courts. We
may not do enough for you, Mr. Nader, but we pass antitrust legis-
lation. We still make the laws; we review the laws and I do not
think this body is turning away from the American public.

  Mr. NADER. Senator
  Senator DECONCINI. NOW, that is very self-serving because I hap-
pen to serve in this body and on this committee, and I know you
disagree with most of the things this committee, or at least this
Senator, does. But I take very seriously our charge to deal with
antitrust laws, and I do not think that we are picking over the left-
over bones.
  Mr. NADER. May I reply, Senator?
  Senator DECONCINI. Certainly, you can reply.
  Mr. NADER. I think, Senator, looking over the last 40, 50 years
in antitrust enforcement, looking at the huge mergers and acquisi-
tions that have occurred of gigantic companies merging and acquir-
ing others, how many times has the Justice Department or the
Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust suit against these
mergers in the last 15 to 20 years compared to the prior years?
  Mergers and acquisitions under antitrust law are almost a dead
letter. Look at the last year--hospital chains buying up hospital
chains; hospitals buying up doctor practices; drug companies buy-
ing up drug distribution companies--just last week, the Eli Lilly
Co. bought, for $4 billion or $6 billion, McKesson subsidiary--
health insurance companies buying up whole networks of HMO's.
  In 1950 and 1960 and even 1970, Senator, the Antitrust Division
would have moved against these mergers. They would not even
have been announced because the Antitrust Division was clear on
its guidelines. Those guidelines are gone. The Turner-Kasin guide-
lines are gone; the Justice Department guidelines are gone in
terms of concentration ratios. Whatever is left of antitrust is ex-
tremely micro, dealing with a tying arrangement here, or a terri-
torial restriction there.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Nader, last question. Are you the presi-
dent of the citizen's group that you represent, or are you just rep-
resenting yourself here?
  Mr. NADER. I am representing myself.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU are representing yourself.
  Mr. NADER. I might add, by the way, and price-fixing by highway
bid-riggers, which is a favorite of the Antitrust Division in the Re-
publican years.
  Senator DECONCINI. What group are you employed with?
  Mr. NADER. I am not employed.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU are not employed; you have no employ-
ment?
  Mr. NADER. NO; I do not take any employment status, period.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU have no salary and no income?
  Mr. NADER. I take no salary from any organization, no expenses,
no benefits--period. That is how I can speak freely and as an indi-
vidual.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO you have separate resources to live on.

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. And you have not worked for any citizens'
groups.
                                      555
  Mr. NADER. I have run citizens' groups; I have started citizens'
groups. I am not paid by any of them.
  Senator DECONCINI. They do not pay any of your costs or any of
the
  Mr. NADER. Zero.
  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Costs of your getting here or
preparing here, or give you an office or
  Mr. NADER. NO; I actually paid the cab fare myself.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU paid the cab fare yourself.
  Mr. NADER. That is right.
  Senator DECONCINI. And that money comes from your own re-
sources?
  Mr. NADER. Yes, it does.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  The Citizen's Group--what is that group?
  Dr. WOLFE. I think it is probably a mistake--I guess it may be
a generic term for all citizens' groups. But I am with Public Citi-
zen's Health Research Group, and Mr. Nader is independent.
  Senator DECONCINI. What is that?
  Dr. WOLFE. That is an organization that was started by Mr.
Nader, and shortly thereafter by me, about 22 years ago.
  Senator DECONCINI. And what is it? Is it a public interest group?
  Dr. WOLFE. It is a consumer research and advocacy group, fund-
ed largely through membership.
  Senator DECONCINI. I see. Nonprofit?
  Dr. WOLFE. Not for profit; right.
  Senator DECONCINI. Not for profit.
  Dr. WOLFE. Right.
  Senator DECONCINI. And who are the contributors to that group?
  Dr. WOLFE. Mainly small contributors, $20, $30 a year.
  Senator DECONCINI. And Mr. Constantine, I do not know your
background.
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. My background, Senator, is that I was chief
antitrust enforcer for New York State; chairman of the task force
which coordinated antitrust enforcement for all 50 States for a
number of years; I was a partner at McDermott, Will & Emory,
which is a national law firm with over 500 lawyers. I left in April
this year, and I started my own law firm with six lawyers. So I
guess you could call me a small businessman at this point.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Estes, I know who you are.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. I might say to Senator DeConcini,
we have had the opportunity to know Mr. Nader and Sid Wolfe to
the greatest degree, and that organization has been invaluable to
our health committee, going back to the pharmaceutical companies,
the distributions of sampling, and the arrangements that have
been made in terms of how the "me-too" drugs have come onto the
market and have been used in many instances to subvert the real
consumers' interests, and a variety of different public health
areas
  Senator DECONCINI. Would the Senator yield for a comment on
that?
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes.
                                               556

  Senator DECONCINI. I am glad to hear that Mr. Nader has of-
fered something constructive and positive, because what he did
during the recent vote on product liability to Senator Rockefeller
was disgraceful. The editorials and articles that he had printed in
West Virginia; it was a disgrace. I am glad there is something good
about him.

  Mr. NADER. I welcome your written justification of that slur.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, as I was just saying about Sidney Wolfe
and Lloyd Constantine, they came down and testified a number of
years ago when we were considering another nominee, Mr. Bork,
and I remember his testimony at that time.
  I would just say I have great interest in the whole area of anti-
trust and antitrust law. I think men and women of good faith and
understanding of these laws have differing views.
  It is interesting. Bob Pitofsky, who will be coming up just after-
wards, was a very effective member in pursuing consumers' inter-
est in the period of President Carter's administration and other
agencies as well. And his view, as well as other associates, are dif-
ferent in terms of the nominee's commitment to assuring the lowest
possible prices and quality products for the American consumers.
But I am grateful to you. I apologize to the other members not
being here earlier. We have been working on the health issues in
the Senate, and I was necessarily absent. But I appreciate your ap-
pearance here.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Nader, I note under your category, Judge Breyer and cor-
porate economic power, your statement about his record involving
antitrust and other business litigation cases. And you cite at page
6 his ruling in favor of the corporate defendant 16 out of 16 times,
17 out of 19 times, or 19 out of 19 times if remands are seen for
their prodefendant effect. It may be that you are referring to anti-
trust matters as opposed to corporate matters generally.

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. It does not say that on the face. But even if
you were, I asked Richard Hertling, my chief counsel--I just had
a look at your statement coming in here a few moments ago, and
he produced for me on fairly short order seven fairly impressive
cases where Judge Breyer has found against major corporate inter-
ests. One of them is Biomedical Instrument v. Cordis Corporation,
where a dealer brought an action for illegal termination of a dealer-
ship agreement, and Judge Breyer reversed the district court which
had granted summary judgment for the big corporate defendant.
And Judge Breyer wrote the opinion, holding that a genuine issue
of material fact existed.

  Another very significant opinion of Judge Breyer's involved a
case against the giant, American Cyanamid Co., where the issue
was on immunity or barring litigation under the National Child-
hood Vaccine Injury Act, where a Federal statute was passed to try
to provide some limitation of liability, and Judge Breyer wrote the
opinion, holding that the statute had to be narrowly interpreted to
bar a suit by the minor who was immunized, but that others in the
family, parents, could bring a lawsuit.
                                      557

  And Venturelli v. Cincinnati, Inc., where a worker who had
crushed the tip of his index finger in a plank-sheering machine
brought suit against a manufacturer for defective machinery, alleg-
ing breach of warranty, and the court of appeals, with Judge
Breyer writing the opinion, found in favor of the injured party
against a major corporation.

  The case denominated DuPont v. Cullen, where Judge Breyer
upheld a finding of the bankruptcy court against DuPont, would
had asserted a judgment creditor's claim.

  New Hampshire Motor Transportation Association v. Flynn,
where Judge Breyer wrote the opinion against the corporate de-
fendant, holding in favor of the State, and an issue regarding li-
cense fees required for hazardous waste, which was an issue of en-
vironmental protection.

  A fifth case, NLRB v. Community Health Services, where Judge
Breyer held in favor of the Government against a company on an
issue of certification.

  NLRB v. Northeastern University, where Judge Breyer found in
favor of the Government against the university involving a union
election on issues of abuse of discretion.

  My question to you is: In making the assertion as to Judge
Breyer's unfairness as to the major corporations, if you took into
account his general record above and beyond the 16 or 19 cases you
cite--and I repeat that I have just had these cases pulled in the
course of the past half hour, while Senator DeConcini was ques-
tioning.

  Mr. NADER. Well, I was referring to antitrust, and the paragraph
prior indicated that. It would have been better to put the antitrust
word in that paragraph again. So I was referring to antitrust.

  He has not ruled against plaintiffs all the time. We did not say
he did. We said he has a pronounced inclination to favor corporate
defendants most of the time. If you look at racketeering cases
under RICO, if you look at the securities fraud cases, it is hard to
be a plaintiff in Judge Breyer's courtroom.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, the cases I just cited involve plaintiffs.

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. And these are close legal issues where he
found against major corporate defendants. Did your analysis go be-
yond these 19 cases to his full record with any statistical tabulation
as to how he did overall?

  Mr. NADER. Well, we have his opinions. We have not made a sta-
tistical tabulation across the board. He has not been good on dis-
ability rights cases, four bad decisions out of four, in our judgment.
He had two out of two bad decisions in freedom of information
cases.

  I am not saying he makes every decision wrong. I am much more
concerned about his writings that are so hostile to the efficacious
prospect of greater democratic public participation in regulatory
processes. That is what really worries me, because that is what is
relevant to the Supreme Court, prognostication.

  Senator SPECTER. YOU are talking about now his writings as op-
posed to his decisions? You are talking about his books and his ar-
ticles as opposed to his writings in legal opinions on cases?
                                             558

  Mr. NADER. TO summarize, he has not decided for the corporate
defendant in 100 percent of the cases. But I am saying he is first
of all judges on the Federal circuit court in the percentage of times
he has decided for corporate defendants in antitrust cases, and in
all the other cases, he has decided for the corporate defendant more
often than not. He has also decided for Government on more occa-
sions than I would have liked, and disability rights cases and free-
dom of information cases.

  There seems to be an inclination to find a rationale for the more
powerful party to a litigation. And when I read his book in conjunc-
tion with his decisions, Senator, I saw where he was really coming
from. He has an analysis of the regulatory agencies, how to make
them better in the health and safety area, and he discounts, I
think extremely radically, the possibility that Congress, the courts,
the common law of liability, and greater democratic participation
can make, the contribution they can make to alerting,
rationalizing, and improving the health and safety regulatory poli-
cies. And his solution is a supercorps of wise people somewhere
near the Office of Management and Budget to oversee and rational-
ize and coordinate the regulatory agencies.

  Senator SPECTER. A corps of supersmart people near OMB?
Where would they be housed? [Laughter.]

  Mr. NADER. Page 80 of his book is an exceptionally revealing
statement, and he is talking about his examination in the book of
the problems of risk regulation. He says:

  It offers an equally strong counter-argument to the hopeful position that more di-
rect democratic public involvement will automatically lead to better results, such as
the public itself wants.

  I do not know what else has led over the history of our country
to better results in government than democratic participation that
spills over into Congress, that elaborates the common law through
the litigation, that improves the information flow of the agencies.

  Good heavens, some of these agencies would never have been cre-
ated to save lives if it was not for concerned physicians and con-
sumers and doctors, whether it is the Food and Drug Administra-
tion, the EPA, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administra-
tion.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I do not discount democratic participa-
tion, but the review that my staff has made of the cases that I pro-
duced on short notice suggests to me that there is some balance as
to what he has had to say. But let me move on to one other ques-
tion, and that is the issue you raise as to Presidential Counsel
Lloyd Cutler.

  I just saw a few minutes ago, after Senator Biden put it in the
record, Mr. Cutler's letter dated July 15, where he takes issue with
a number of your statements. On page 1 of your statement you talk
about "Mr. Cutler can still take his draw, by the end of the year,
from his law firm." And Mr. Cutler disputes that factually, saying,
"Moreover, because I am no longer a member of the firm but rather
a salaried senior counsel who will be paid only for the time I work
at the firm, I take no draw from the law firm at the end of the
year." And he earlier says in his letter, "While I have chosen to
serve without governmental compensation, I have also arranged to
                                      559

have my salary from the law firm reduced to reflect the time I am
devoting to Government service."

  My question to you is: Do you have any factual basis to dispute
what Mr. Cutler is saying or any factual basis for your statement
in your prepared testimony that Mr. Cutler can take a draw from
his firm?

  Mr. NADER. Yes; Mr. Cutler, as you know, is the rainmaker for
the firm. He is the founding partner. He is no longer technically
a partner. His status is special counsel. And he can take income
from that firm at the end of the year. He is only supposed to be
working in the White House until August, but he can take income.
He can; whether he does or not depends on how much political ex-
posure his dual role is given in the coming weeks. But my criticism
is not just based on the income that he could draw from that firm--
and there was a report that he was going to draw something like
$300,000, which is not a full partner's draw in the current year be-
fore he went into the White House.

  My concern, Senator Specter, is one that I would hope you would
share with me. Never in the history of the country has the special
counsel to the President of the United States retained a legal sta-
tus as special counsel in a corporate law firm down the street with
dozens of major corporate clients whose business may be affected
indirectly or directly by decisions made in the White House where
Lloyd Cutler is a major player. He is everywhere in the White
House. Lloyd Cutler is at large in the White House, passing on ju-
dicial nominations, advising on product liability issues. He is every-
where. And anybody who knows Lloyd Cutler knows that he is ev-
erywhere when he is anywhere.

  I think that is truly improper. I think that this has never been
done before. And if wants to be special counsel to the White House,
he should resign his status in the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Picker-
ing. And I might add that I have heard now from at least 10
sources, from the White House and from the press, who are close
to this issue, that Judge Breyer was Lloyd Cutler's choice. He is
a long-time professional, personal, and philosophic colleague of
Judge Breyer, and at key junctures in the decisional, or shall we
say indecisional process by President Clinton, Lloyd Cutler gently
put forth the reasons for President Clinton to nominate Judge
Breyer.

  Now, if he is counsel, fine. But not when he has one big foot
down the street in one of the most aggressive and, I think, anti-
consumer corporate law firms that I have ever had to deal with
over the last 25 years, including fighting him on the airbag stand-
ard, which they held up for years on behalf of General Motors and
Ford and other clients.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, that is
  Senator KENNEDY. I am glad to find that out about him. I
thought I had something about recommending
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. That is quite an additional state-
ment, Mr. Nader. I have a factual basis for saying to you that you
are wrong when you say he is everywhere. I tried to reach him on
the phone last night and could not find him. So there is some com-
petent testimony for you.
  Mr. NADER. I meant that he is everywhere on policy issues.
                                      560

  Senator SPECTER. I mean some firsthand testimony. If I have to
take an affidavit and have it admitted into evidence, unlike most
of what we hear, not only in this room, but everywhere in the Sen-
ate campus.

  Mr. NADER. I did not mean physically he is everywhere.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, spiritually? I could not find him. [Laugh-
ter.]
  When you talk about his
  Senator HATCH. A little bit like the Holy Ghost, I guess.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. When you talk about his being at
large, I have not heard that kind of reference since Al Capone was
talked about being at large, or perhaps Capone was a lesser threat
to the country than Cutler.
  But when you say in your statement
  Mr. NADER. He was a lesser threat.
  Senator SPECTER. There is no question pending, Mr. Nader.
[Laughter.]
  Mr. NADER. The airbag issue alone has cost hundreds of thou-
sands of lives.
  Senator SPECTER. There is no question pending, Mr. Nader. Let
me ask you a question, Mr. Nader.

   Mr. NADER. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. When you say here--well, how about that?
Just a little decorum.

  When you say here, page 2 of your statement, "all kinds of im-
portant decisions which can have substantial benefit to some or
most of the many corporate clients of his law firm," and the state-
ment you just made, do you have any evidence on that? And you
and I are lawyers, Mr. Nader. Do you have any evidence on that?
Evidence?

  Mr. NADER. Oh, yes, I have.
  Senator SPECTER. Give me one piece of evidence and pause.
  Mr. NADER. First of all, he has dealt with Robert Rubin and oth-
ers on the political aspects of economic policy being discussed in
the White House.
  Senator SPECTER. I am asking about a benefit to a corporate cli-
ent, one bit of evidence.
  Mr. NADER. Judge Breyer, Judge Breyer.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Breyer is a corporate client?
  Mr. NADER. NO; I think his ascension to the Supreme Court will
benefit corporate preferred policy.
  Senator SPECTER. You talk about substantial benefits to some or
most of the many corporate clients of his firm. I am asking you if
you have any evidence--that means firsthand knowledge--of a ben-
efit to a corporate client of his law firm.
  Mr. NADER. Where did I say direct?
  Senator SPECTER. On page 2, you say
  Mr. NADER. Directly impacting, even if he does not work on
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. "Engage in all kinds of important
decisions which can have substantial benefit to some or most of the
many corporate clients of his firm (auto, banking, chemical, drug,
mining and other commercial interests)," and I ask you for the
fourth time: Do you have any evidence of any benefit to anybody,
any client of the Cutler firm?
                                      561

  Mr. NADER. YOU did not finish the sentence: "even if he does not
work"

  Senator SPECTER. I did not finish a lot of sentences.
  Mr. NADER. "Even if he does not work on matters directly im-
pacting those clients." The job of special counsel to the President
affects political, economic, and social policies out of the White
House. It is his burden of proof to show us that he is not fulfilling
the conventional duties of a special counsel to the President. I am
saying I know something of what he has been doing. It is up to him
to come clean.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, all right. Now I understand your posi-
tion. It is up to him on his burden of proof, and your statement
about benefits to clients of his law firm is unsupported by any evi-
dence.
  Let me move on to one other line.
  Mr. NADER. I would disagree with your characterization of my
testimony. Continue, please.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, then let's read the full sentence on page
2:

  Instead, the issue is whether it is proper for a member of a major Washington
law firm to also serve as counsel to the President, pass on judicial nominations, en-
gage in all kinds of important decisions which can have substantial benefit to some
or most of the many corporate clients of his firm (auto, banking, chemical, drug,
mining and other commercial interests), even if he does not work on matters directly
impacting those clients.

  Now, my question to you, having read the full sentence, is: Can
you give one example of competent evidence that he has under-
taken any governmental conduct as counsel to the President which
has had a benefit to any corporate client of his law firm?

  Mr. NADER. I said "which can have substantial benefit."
  First, I am not privy to all the internal workings of a special
counsel to the President, except that I know that he has very spe-
cial and important responsibilities on what the President thinks,
does, and decides.
  Second, he is passing on judicial nominations, and people as close
to the process as the Alliance for Justice are saying that he has ar-
gued against some progressive nominees for the Federal bench.
That can have--can have, Senator Specter--a substantial benefit to
some of his corporate clients. Can.
  The burden of proof is on him. He is the one who has a foot in
the corporate client sector of his law firm and a foot in the White
House. Never before has a counsel to the President had that dual
role and worn both hats.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Nader, do you have any reason to con-
tradict Mr. Cutler's assertion that "Ethics officials in the White
House in the Office of Government Ethics thoroughly reviewed and
cleared the proposed arrangement"?
  Mr. NADER. Are you asking me whether his status is legal? It is
legal. Is it ethical? No! Should the law be changed? Because it was
never intended by Congress to apply to the Office of the Counsel.
It was intended to apply to geologists, scientists, and other tech-
nical personnel to help out for a short period of time Federal agen-
cies. Yes, I think the law should be changed, and I think the Judi-
ciary Committee is the proper jurisdiction for that possibility.
                                      562

  Senator SPECTER. Well, those are direct answers to three other
questions. Now let me repeat my question. Do you have any factual
basis to contradict Mr. Cutler's statement that "Ethics officials in
the White House and the Office of Government Ethics thoroughly
reviewed and cleared the proposed arrangement"?

  Mr. NADER. NO, I do not contradict him, and I do not give it all
that balance because we should have independent, external ethical
review, the way he asked for Judge Breyer.

  Senator SPECTER. A final question, and on this you and I agree.
  Mr. NADER. Thank goodness.
  Senator SPECTER. I do not know, Mr. Nader. We both may be in
trouble with that occurrence.
  You support my view that nominees are less likely to answer
questions when the confirmation process is seen as a sure matter.
Would you agree with my characterization that Judge Breyer an-
swered more questions than previous nominees, specifically Justice
Ginsburg, Justice Souter, Justice Scalia? Start with Justice Scalia.
  Mr. NADER. Oh, yes, definitely.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you. Thank you very much.
  Mr. NADER. I think he gave more answers to easy questions than
the prior three Justices.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  Senator KENNEDY. I just want to make a very brief comment in
taking issue with you, Mr. Nader, about Judge Breyer willing to
take on the corporate giants in this country. I was chairman of the
Antitrust Committee, searched the country to try and find a good
person to succeed in the staff there after Phil Hart left that posi-
tion in the mid-1970's, and was fortunate enough to get Steve
Breyer. And his concept in terms of trying to improve both lowering
costs and improving quality came about with the deregulation of
the economic conditions in this society and also the protections of
health and safety.
  He was willing at that time to take on the airlines. He was will-
ing to take on the trucking companies at that time and was skillful
enough to help and assist both developing a bipartisan kind of coa-
lition in this. And, quite frankly, I was late in terms of attending
this session, but your characterization and the flat kind of com-
ments on that is completely inconsistent with a very, very distin-
guished record.
  I have heard your comments about the various cases. I dare say
the list of the antitrust professors and activists who have a very
distinguished career, a letter which I will put into the record, have
very, very differing kinds of viewpoints.
  [The letter follows:]

                                                                                       July 5, 1994.

Senator JOSEPH R. BIDEN,

Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

  DEAR SENATOR BIDEN: The signers of this letter are professors of law who have
taught antitrust for many years and written often on the subject. We are familiar
with Judge Breyer's record as a scholar in the field of economic regulation, including
antitrust, and a judge occasionally called upon to write antitrust opinions.

  In our view, Judge Breyer is a thoughttul and enlightened advocate of antitrust
enforcement. He understands and appreciates the effectiveness of a free market,
protected by the antitrust laws, in serving the welfare of consumers. He also under-
stands the need for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to correct market
                                      563

failures. We except he would be a vigorous foe of anticompetitive behavior and a
powerful voice in the Supreme Court supporting effective antitrust enforcement.

  We understand that Judge Breyer's record has been criticized by some on two
grounds: (1) it is said that in his judicial opinions, Breyer has consistently ruled in
favor of defendants, producing what has been characterized as pro-Big Business and
anti-consumer results; and (2) the results reached in several particular cases are
said to favor big business over the consumer.

  We believe these criticisms miss the mark. While we may not agree with every
decision or sentence in his opinions, Judge Breyer's views are well within the main-
stream of contemporary thought about antitrust law. The results, more carefully ex-
amined, consistently favor consumers and often are to the advantage of small busi-
ness.

  A. The Charge of Consistent Rulings For Defendants. Judge Breyer has decided
a number of cases in favor of antitrust defendants. To suggest that this shows he
is pro-Big Business and anti-antitrust nevertheless represents a misreading of his
record.

  In the first place, Judge Breyer has upheld meritorious antitrust claims by both
private and government plaintiffs. In Federal Trade Commission y. Monahan,1 he
upheld the Federal Trade Commission's broad authority to investigate evidence of
price fixing in the pharmaceutical industry. In Caribe BMW Inc. v. Bayerische
Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F.3d 745 (1st Cir. 1994), he upheld a challenge
under the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act to price-fixing in the sale of
automobiles. And Judge Breyer has never decided an antitrust case against the gov-
ernment--either federal or state.

   Even in cases where defendants prevail, Judge Breyer's decisions show no antip-
athy to vigorous antitrust enforcement. In most of these decisions, no substantive
question of antitrust law was at issue. In one case, the issue was whether Puerto
Rico should be treated as a state or a territory under the Sherman Act.2 In several
others, Judge Breyer merely voted to deny preliminary relief, and remanded for full
evidentiary proceedings.3 One of the cases was about whether a trial judge should
have been recused in an antitrust case based on a possible personal conflict of inter-
est.4 In still other cases, Judge Breyer simply voted to affirm district court findings
that there was no evidence supporting a claimed antitrust violation.5 In the remain-
ing cases, Breyer refused to find for antitrust plaintiffs, because the result would
have been an unjustified increase in the prices charged to consumers.6 In two cases,
the plaintiff was a large company and the defendant the "small business," so that
decisions in favor of the defendants were hardly pro-"Big Business."

   B. Specific Cases. A second charge against Judge Breyer is that certain of his deci-
sions evidence hostility toward antitrust enforcement. The cases cited are Town of
Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990), Barry Wright Corp. v.
ITT Grinnell Corp., 653 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1981), and Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass.,
Inc., 749 F.2d 922 (1984).

   While Breyer did find for the defendants in all three cases, the important point
is that the decisions are consistent with enlightened antitrust interpretation and en-
forcement. In addition, his decisions helped consumers in each instance.

   1. In Boston Edison, two municipal utilities that bought power from Boston Edi-
son, a large private utility, claimed that Boston Edison had engaged in a "price
squeeze" by selling power to them at a high wholesale price but selling to consumers
at a low price in competition with the municipals. The plaintiffs' complaint was that
Boston Edison was selling at retail at too low a price for them to make a profit.
If they had won out on the point, these small business plaintiffs would thrive be-
cause Boston Edison would have to raise its retail price, but consumes would end
up paying higher bills.

   A price squeeze cause of action is rarely attempted and is usually without merit,
regardless of the market in which the alleged squeeze occurred. Judge Breyer found
that such complaints are even more questionable in a market in which both the
wholesale and retail prices were set by independent regulators. A history of the pro-
ceedings shows why. Boston Electric's wholesale rates had been submitted to and

   1832F.2d 688 (1987).
   2 Cordova & Simonpietri Ins. Agency Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 649 F.2d 36 (1st Cir.,
1981).
   3 See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico v. Caribbean Petroleum, 990 F.2d 25 (1st Cir., 1993);
Rosario v. Amana, 733 F.2d 172 (1st Cir. 1984).
   4Home Placement Serv. Inc. v. Providence Home Journal, 739 F.2d 671 (1st Cir., 1984).
   5 Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pine Ins., 851 F.2d 478 (1st Cir., 1988); Computer Identics
Corp. v. Southern Pac. Co., 756 F.2d 200 (1st Cir. 1985).
   ^Kartell v. Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., 749 F.2d 922 (1st Cir., 1984); Barry Wright
Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 653 F.2d 17 (1st Cir., 1981); Town of Concord v. Boston Edison
Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir., 1990).
                                      564

approved by FERC, a federal regulatory agency, over the opposition of the munici-
pals. That decision in turn had been approved by the courts on review. Thus, the
plaintiffs were attempting to end-run the regulator's decision and prior judicial re-
view by framing their complaint about wholesale prices as an antitrust cause of ac-
tion.

  As Judge Breyer noted, it is difficult for courts to decide what constitutes a fair
price and a fair profit. When independent regulators establish a "fair price," judges
in antitrust cases are understandably reluctant to reverse those decisions--espe-
cially where the result would be to raise prices to consumers.

  2. Barry Wright. In Barry Wright, a small producer of an environmental device
claimed it had been injured because Pacific, its dominant competitor, sold at "preda-
tory"--i.e., below cost--prices. In fact, the record showed that the defendant's prices
were above its full costs. Barry Wright nevertheless sued, asking the court to inter-
vene and prevent low prices to consumers. Breyer recognized that if Pacific's prices
were above its full costs, but below the full costs of rivals, it followed that it would
succeed because it was more efficient than its smaller rivals and was willing to pass
efficiencies on to consumers in the form of lower prices.

  Breyer's decision in Barry Wright is part of a growing trend of judges in antitrust
cases to shy away from supporting antitrust theories that block low prices to con-
sumers. Breyer recognized that where the prices are so extremely low as to evidence
an intent to drive rivals out of business antitrust has a role to play. But where a
company charges prices above its own full costs, it would be senseless--and anti-
consumer--for the court to intervene in order to protect less efficient businesses. A
few years after Judge Breyer's opinion, the Supreme Court in effect ratified his deci-
sion and similar decisions in other circuits that prices above full costs are not preda-
tory, noting that a claim of predatory pricing can only be sustained when the chal-
lenged prices are below some standard of cost. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 113 Sup. Ct. 2578, 2588 (1993).

  3. Kartell. In the Kartell case, a group of physicians challenged Blue Shield be-
cause it extracted from participating doctors a promise not to charge patients an
amount above the insurance fee paid by Blue Shield. A lower court had found that
the effect of the arrangement was to pay doctors at unreasonably low levels and
therefore was an agreement in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the
Sherman Act.

  Judge Breyer found that Blue Shield was not a collection of "buyers," capable of
conspiring, but rather an independent single force, and that single buyers have a
right under the antitrust laws to bargain for the lowest price available. While the
defendant once again won in a Breyer opinion, the real effect was to sustain cost-
containment efforts by a major insurer and to prevent doctors from charging higher
prices to their patients.

  In sum, Judge Breyer's opinions are sharp in analysis and economically sophisti-
cated. He understands the theory of antitrust, appreciates the consumer protection
and other values underlying it, and can be expected to support effective antitrust
enforcement. He is unlikely, however, to join decisions that, in effect, protect ineffi-
cient businesses at the expense of consumers.

        Very truly yours,

                                                                  PHILLIP AREEDA,

  Senator KENNEDY. I respect your position on it. We can have
these areas of difference. But I must say that the blatant and fla-
grant kind of commentary and characterization I think is basically
unfair. I know that you have a differing view on it, but I will say
that I am not going to let those general comments, at least in my
presence, go by without some kind of response.

  Mr. NADER. Well, Senator, I testified before your subcommittee
in favor of airline deregulation. I think it was in 1974.

  Senator KENNEDY. Right.
  Mr. NADER. And even my testimony was mischaracterized by Mr.
Breyer in his book "Regulation and Reform." Because you remem-
ber that there are always two caveats, and I think you shared
them, to any airline or trucking deregulation. One was a consistent
enforcement of the antitrust laws
  Senator KENNEDY. Exactly right.
  Mr. NADER [continuing]. And the second was enforcement of safe-
ty laws. I think he did some good work in that area. But I think
in the last 20 years, with the merger
  Senator KENNEDY. Just before we leave that, the safety part was
set aside, the FAA, if you remember that, and we ran into a Justice
Department that was completely complacent in terms of the--I
mean we don't want to go all the way back on through Lorenzo and
the others on it, but there was absolutely no kind of activity, and
what we saw really was a deterioration in terms of what that
whole experience was, where the ones that were left in were able
to, in a predatory way, reduce the certain kind of fares in order to
disadvantage the newer entries into the system. We don't want to
go all the way back into it.
  But I must say the areas at that time were joined by Senator
Javits, where he outlined a whole series of different areas where
we were going to try and free up the areas of economic competition.
I iust think the only areas that we were able to was in the airlines
and then in trucking, and then what happened is that concept was
taken and accepted in terms of the financial institutions, and that
was the end of it, because there was absolutely no kind of effort.
  I am not familiar on the mischaracterization in the book on it,
but I do think that the record over that service in terms of the com-
mittee, at a time when there was, as you correctly characterize it,
not the kind of vigorous antitrust enforcement policy was an impor-
tant and creative way of trying to energize some of the competitive
forces. This is on Judge Breyer's nomination, and not on the issues
on deregulation.
  Mr. NADER. Senator, I would have looked forward to Judge
Breyer, even before he became a judge, to lending his voice to criti-
cizing the automatic merger approvals in the airline industry that
he fought to deregulate under the Republican administrations. I
think there were 20, out of 20 merger approvals between airlines
approved by the Reagan and Bush administrations. It does occur
to me to wonder why, in the greatest merger and consolidation
wave in American history, Judge Breyer showed, whether in his
                                         566

writings or in his decisions, extremely little concern over this con-
solidation of corporate power. ,

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the answer would probably be he was on
the circuit court from 1980 when Reagan got in.

  Mr. NADER. SO one answer is there aren't many conglomerate
merger cases coming to any judges these days. But he wrote and
he lectured, and his voice was respected in these areas, and there
is hardly a note of worry or caution or criticism on the growing con-
centration of power in one industry after another due to mergers
and acquisitions that are not challenged by the FTC or the Justice
Department, and that makes me puzzled.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, this is probably a pretty good time to go
into the next panel, which will have--excuse me, I am sorry. I
thought that had been done before. Senator Metzenbaum, I apolo-
gize. I thought that I had arrived when Senator DeConcini was
questioning.

  Senator METZENBAUM. NO problem at all.
  It is pretty obvious what the issue is before the committee today,
and that is shall we confirm Lloyd Cutler for some particular posi-
tion. [Laughter.]
  I heard more comments about Lloyd Cutler since I have been
back here than I did about Steve Breyer. Now, coming to Steve
Breyer, I think we all have to be realists. Steve Breyer is up for
confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States, and un-
less some major development occurs that nobody anticipates, he is
going to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
  That being the case, we have to put the testimony of the four of
you in its proper context. And I appreciate that testimony, because,
frankly, it in some respects goes down the same road that I had
raised or roads that I had raised, issued I had raised at an earlier
point.
  You raised the issues not because, on that basis, Steve Breyer is
not going to be confirmed for the Supreme Court. You raised the
issues, in my opinion, for the same reason I raised the issues, and
that is to sensitize Judge Breyer when he sits on that Court. When
he sits on that Court, some of the issues that have to concern you
and concern me and concern Judge Breyer and concern the Amer-
ican people, is this whole question of the element of how much reg-
ulation and do you go all the way to the point that the EPA or
some regulatory agency thinks you should go, or do you do some-
thing less, because to go all the way may cost X number of dollars.
  Now, the fact is, if you go all the way, you are going to save 1,
2, 50, or 100 more lives. I don't have any opinions and don't have
any knowledge as to how many it will be. So I think that many of
your questions and many of my questions truly relate both in the
environmental area and the health area and the antitrust area to
bringing Judge Breyer up to a sense of awareness, not that he is
not a very aware man, not that he is not a very knowledgeable
man.
  But the whole question is, knowing that he is going to be con-
firmed, it seems to me that the four of you who appear before this
committee in order to raise issues, because there isn't much doubt
in my mind that Judge Breyer is listening to what is going on at
                                                567

this hearing and is sensitive to the issues to which you are at-
tempting to sensitize him.

  I thought it was rather interesting that all four of you sort of
spent a fair amount of time--I wasn't here, but my staff has told
me--on the Town of Concord case as a basis for raising concerns
about Judge Breyer. He said that his decision in that case, and ac-
tually said it, I believe, if my recollection serves me right, in a
hearing, that his decision he felt would benefit the consumers.

  Well, this Senator has strong feelings to the contrary that the
costs to consumers, the city of Concord is going to get a $39 million
verdict. Judge Breyer took that verdict away from them. To this
moment, I don't think he arrived at the appropriate conclusion, but
I am not the judge. We make laws, and judges render court deci-
sions.

  Would any of you care to address yourselves to the Town of Con-
cord case? I actually did not hear you, since I wasn't present, but
I gather that all of you took issue with the whole question of

  Dr. WOLFE. YOU are talking about this Ottati and Goss, the
dumping case?

  Mr. CONSTANTINE. Senator, I would like to address it. I think
more important than the issue as to whether the $39 million ver-
dict was taken away from Senator Kennedy's constituents in Con-
cord and Wellesley is the issue as to whether or not, as Judge
Breyer has characterized it, that the remedy in that case that the
plaintiff sought was to raise prices. This involved a price squeeze,
and the price squeeze involves the relationship between wholesale
and retail prices.

  What Judge Breyer said here was that I would have had to raise
retail prices or that would have been the effect of granting the
judgment for the plaintiff. That was not the case. What had to hap-
pen was the wholesale prices had to be lowered, and that is what
the plaintiff sought in that case. If wholesale prices had been low-
ered, then retail prices also could have been lowered, and there
would have been a more competitive structure at both levels of the
market.

  More important than that, in that case, Judge Breyer went on
to decide at least three other cases that were not before the court
at that time. In this area, he is clearly and demonstrably a judicial
activist who reaches out to decide issues which are not before him.
Those issues will come before him in the next few years.

  The issue of tying will come before him. The vertical mergers will
come before him. The issue of monopoly leveraging will come before
him. The issue of price squeezes in unregulated industry will come
before him, and he has pretty clearly stated how he is going to vote
in those cases. In every instance, those votes are contrary to the
specific meaning of section 2 of the Sherman Act.

  That is my attempt to try to explain this and to deal with the
now famous graph which you exhibited at the hearing on Tuesday,
Senator.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I did not hear that.
  Mr. CONSTANTINE. The triangular graph which you showed at
the hearing on Tuesday, Senator, the widget graph.

      85-742 - 95 - 19
                                             568

  Mr. NADER. The other point, if I may just add to that, Senator,
is that Professor Carstensen, whose criticism of Judge Breyer's de-
cision that is attached to my testimony, states:

  Although Concord, the plaintiff, the Town of Concord, satisfied a jury and trial
judge that the price squeeze existed and its purpose was to harm the competitive
capacity of towns being squeezed, Judge Breyer ordered the case dismissed. He did
so on two conclusions: First, that the antitrust laws should not be generally used
to condemn price squeezes engaged in by monopolists, if both levels of price is sub-
ject to direct regulation.

  Well, it is Federal and State regulation, and the ability of utili-
ties to manipulate Federal and State regulation is almost infinite,
in order to achieve their strategic objective.

  The other point is, Professor Carstensen adds:

  Without any examination or recognition of the lengthy, well worked-out theories
of how regulatory prices can be and are used strategically to harm consumer and
other public interests, Judge Breyer starts from the naive assumption that regula-
tion is done in the public interest.

Hence, he asserts that "regulation significantly diminishes the like-
lihood of major antitrust harm."

  I think there is a lot of record in this country's regulatory history
to contradict Judge Breyer on that point. But the entire critique of
that case is in my testimony. The reason why Professor Carstensen
thought this was an important case, Senator Metzenbaum, is he
thought it had applications to the new telecommunications indus-
try and the way that industry is going to be structured. The price
squeeze, the wholesale, the retail, there are a lot of parallels that
are about to get into play after the legislation is passed in Congress
on the telecommunications industry.

  Mr. CONSTANTINE. If I might just briefly, Senator, the 1992 Cable
Act, which the Congress labored over so long, is to a certain extent
a set of industry specific antitrust regulations. A lot of what the
Congress did in that major enactment was deal with the issue of
vertical mergers and vertical integration, the control of program-
mers by companies upstream or downstream. So Congress has al-
ready spoken on this issue very specifically and in a very important
industry in the United States.

  What Judge Breyer has told you in a very profound way and very
clearly, because he writes very, very well, is that he just doesn't see
it, he doesn't see any harm whatsoever and there can never be any
harm in taking your power from one level of an industry and
leveraging it into a competitive advantage or a monopoly at an-
other level of the industry. He says not to worry about that.

  Dr. WOLFE. May I just comment on that. Mr. Nader alluded
briefly to the wave of vertical mergers going on, where drug compa-
nies, large drug companies buy up drug distribution systems. In
the last year, between Merck buying up Medco, one distribution
system, SmithKline buying up a second one, and now Lilly buying
up McKesson, the transactional costs of those three deals were $12
billion, money drained out of the health care system. Interestingly,
Judge Breyer says if we worked a little better on regulation, we
would free up money for health care and breast cancer and every-
thing. Well, here is money just going down the drain.

  But, worse than that, those three companies now have an esti-
mated 80 percent of the entire prepaid prescription filling systems
                                      569

market in this country, three companies. There does not yet seem
to have been any kind of serious challenge to this kind of vertical
integration that Mr. Constantine has just talked about, and we
have reason to believe that if such a case ever got up to the Su-
preme Court, that Judge Breyer would be on the side of the big
drug companies and the distribution systems.

  The health care system is being destroyed, amongst other things,
by mergers and acquisitions. Eight insurance companies now own
half of the HMO's in this country. As Mr. Nader mentioned, hos-
pitals are being bought by chains which are buying up other
chains, and so forth and so on. So it is in the health area, the big-
gest in the country, at a trillion dollars, at an unprecedented time
of mergers and acquisitions.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Dr. Wolfe, you criticized Judge Breyer for
his views on risk assessment in health and safety regulations. Why
do you consider Judge Breyer's views a matter of concern in the
context of a Supreme Court nominee? Will he have anything to do
with that? The whole question of Judge Breyer's concern about risk
assessment seems to be that if it costs too much to do, then you
get to a certain point and it isn't worth spending that extra $10
million or $100 million or whatever the case may be.

  Dr. WOLFE. Well, I am concerned, for a couple of reasons. One--
and this is the good news, I guess, of this whole discussion--a year
ago, when Mr. Nader and I criticized the first version of this book
that he put out, he was sensitive enough to ask if he could meet
with us, and we met with him, and I pointed out a number of fac-
tual errors in the book. He changed some. Unfortunately, he didn't
change others.

  One of the things we talked about was what is the basis for say-
ing that we are going to be pouring billions or tens of billions down
the drain to go this last 10 percent. I said what is the evidence that
it is just 10 percent that we have left undone, given that the major-
ity, over 50 percent of occupational cancers are not regulated, and
that on the site that he ruled on in southeastern New Hampshire,
there is a massive amount of pollution still there.

  When he sat on this case in the first circuit coming up from the
New Hampshire district court, there was a lot of need to look at
the evidence for the various kinds of risk assessment that had been
done. I don't know how many more of these cases are going to get
that far or get up to the Supreme Court, but I think that in the
opinion that he wrote in that case, he certainly acknowledged some
awareness of risk assessment. I think that his views on risk assess-
ment, as he stated in his book, are that the Government is over-
estimating between a thousand and a million times, and those are
the kinds of views that would tend to make someone rule against
the Government in some cases, as he did in part of that Ottati and
Goss case.

  So I think that, aside from disagreeing with his views on risk as-
sessment, I think that as more of these environmental cases get
litigated, he may well have an opportunity to impose those views
on the way in which he judges the case. I know he said yesterday,
after Senator Biden chastised him for some of the things that he
said, he said I can assure you that the views that I take in this
                                                570

book are going to have nothing to do with what I do as a judge.
We are concerned that he may not be right about that.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I think your response is helpful in
a particular respect, because it is obvious that Judge Breyer, after
writing his book and having received some criticism from you and
Ralph Nader, saw fit to meet with you to talk about it.

  Dr. WOLFE. That is what I said is the good news. I characterized
that as good news, because, as I said at the end of my testimony,
he is a good listener. As you were saying before, given that it is
a given that he is going to get confirmed, what can we do here?
Why are we here? We do not think this is an exercise in futility,
and we can only hope that he will be sensitive to the concerns that
we have raised.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I think, in all reality, that is about the
main thrust of where we are going in much of this hearing. No
question about it that I had some concerns, still have some con-
cerns about his financial exposure and the propriety of when he
does or does not recuse himself. I don't have much doubt in my
mind that when this man goes on the Supreme Court, he is going
to be extremely sensitive to that very issue and has already indi-
cated that he would take certain positive steps in order to make
his position of possible exposure by reason of his Lloyd's invest-
ment known to the litigants in trial.

  I think that the discussions that have been had here today and
the previous questions that this Senator and other Senators have
asked him concerning the whole question of risk assessment vis-a-
vis adequate regulatory procedures, particularly in the area to
which you address yourself, the matter of health, is very, very sig-
nificant, and I can't help but believe that he will live with some of
these questions for the balance of his life, at least as a matter of
awareness.

  The matters that Mr. Constantine raised concerning the anti-
trust issues and that I have raised, I think we also believe that in
that area, Judge Breyer, I don't know if I can say will be a better
judge, but I think that Justice Breyer will be a more alert, more
concerned, more sensitive, more aware of his own particular situa-
tion as he sits on the Supreme Court than he might otherwise have
been.

  I don't think there was any question from the inception of these
hearings that this man is going to be confirmed. I don't think you
appeared before this committee thinking that your testimony was
going to keep him from being confirmed or that you were going to
change any votes.

  But I hope that your efforts, the efforts of some of us on this
committee, and I think his own efforts to try to become more aware
of some of these issues may very possibly bring about a better Jus-
tice Breyer than the Judge Breyer that some of us have seen fit
to have some reservations about.

  I thank you. I have no further questions.
  Mr. NADER. YOU mean you don't think we are going to change
Senator Hatch's mind?
  Senator METZENBAUM. We can change Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. He has a powerful influence on me, I must say.
                                      571

  Senator METZENBAUM. He is changing a lot. I haven't seen it, but
in my heart I know he is changing. [Laughter.]

  Mr. NADER. In the biography of Senator Hatch, his greatest con-
tribution, in my judgment, to the American people was that he fa-
cilitated the nomination of Dr. Kessler to head the Food and Drug
Administration.

  Senator METZENBAUM. That was one of the great things that he
did. He is not sleeping well at night these days by reason of that
fact.

  Senator HATCH. YOU know, Ralph, that is the first nice thing you
ever said about me. [Laughter.]

  Mr. NADER. Well, you may not be sleeping well at night, but a
lot of people in the country are.

  Senator HATCH. Actually, I sleep well and Dave Kessler and I are
good friends, even though he makes a lot of mistakes. But I am
glad he has Sidney Wolfe keeping him on the ball. [Laughter.]

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  There is a vote under way, so we will recess briefly and then
come back and listen to our next panel. I will take just a moment
now to introduce our next panel. These are two outstanding aca-
demics. Robert Pitofsky is the former head of the Federal Trade
Commission, dean of Georgetown University Law Center. Mr.
Pitofsky has written extensively on antitrust law. Cass Sunstein is
the Karl Llewellyn Professor of Law at the University of Chicago
Law School. Professor Sunstein clerked for Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall, served in the Department of Justice, is recognized as a leader
in the legal-academic realm on administrative and constitutional
law.
  Also on the panel is Martha Matthews. Ms. Matthews served as
a clerk at every level of the Federal court system, including as a
clerk to the nominee and to Justice Blackmun, Judge Breyer*s
predecessor, if confirmed. Matthews is currently staff attorney for
the National Center for Youth Law in San Francisco.
  So we will commence with that panel. I am delighted that we are
having back Professors Pitofsky and Sunstein. They have been fa-
miliar figures to this committee over a long period of time. We al-
ways benefit from their insights and their help and assistance to
all of us on the committee. We apologize to them for the interrup-
tion, but we will be back in a few moments and continue on with
the hearing.
  The committee stands in recess.
  [Recess.]
  Senator KENNEDY. We will come to order. I think our colleagues
will be winding up their votes on the floor, but we will move ahead
with the testimony. We are very, very grateful to all of you. I saw
you in here at the opening moments earlier today, and I know you
have been--I think Professor Pitofsky has followed this hearing,
the other hearings as well. We are very grateful to you for all of
you joining with us, and we look forward to your comments.
  We will start, I guess, with Bob.

PANEL CONSISTING OF ROBERT PITOFSKY, PROFESSOR OF
  LAW, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER, WASHING-
  TON, DC; CASS R. SUNSTEIN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF
  CHICAGO LAW SCHOOL AND DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL
  SCIENCE, CHICAGO, IL; AND MARTHA MATTHEWS, STAFF AT-
  TORNEY, NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW, AND FORMER
  LAW CLERK TO JUDGE STEPHEN G. BREYER, SAN FRAN-
  CISCO, CA

                  STATEMENT OF ROBERT PITOFSKY
  Mr. PITOFSKY. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. It is a privilege to
be invited to testify in these important hearings.
  I believe that Steve Breyer from all points of view is an outstand-
ing nominee to the Supreme Court. I will concentrate today, how-
ever, on that part of his record dealing with economic regulation
and particularly his record in antitrust. That record has been sub-
ject to very thoughtful questions by Senator Metzenbaum and oth-
ers on the committee, and subject to some criticism by witnesses
who testified a little earlier today.
  I recognize two themes in the criticism. One is sort of a numbers
game approach that Judge Breyer is supposed to have decided an
unusual number of cases in favor of defendants in antitrust cases,
and then there has been some criticism of specific decisions.
  As far as the numbers game is concerned, first of all, if people
are going to use the numbers game approach, they ought to get
their numbers right. The claim is--I nave heard it repeatedly
today--that he decided 16 consecutive cases against the defendant.
Actually, the score was 14 to 2, and I cited two cases for the plain-
tiff in my prepared testimony. Also, the fact is that in all Federal
courts, 75 percent or so of cases are decided in favor of defendants
in antitrust matters. So if the record had been 12 to 4, it would
have been average, and in Judge Breyer's court it turns out to be
14 to 2. That is hardly a devastating disclosure.
  But, in any event, I did not want to play the numbers game. I
think that approach asks the wrong question. The real issue is not
whether the plaintiff or defendant wins; it is whether the competi-
tive process and consumers win. And that can occur if the plaintiffs
prevail or the defendants prevail. And as I will try to discuss in
a moment, I believe in the cases for which he has been most criti-
cized, the competitive process and consumers won.
  Also, we are talking here about 14 cases decided in favor of de-
fendants, but many of them involved trivial issues from the point
of view of antitrust policy. One case addressed the question of
whether Puerto Rico was a State or a territory. Well, it came up
in an antitrust case, but that is hardly an antitrust policy question.
  Another case involved the issue of whether a judge should recuse
himself because of a conflict of interest.
  In two cases, Judge Breyer and his colleagues denied a prelimi-
nary injunction, but the parties were then free to litigate the mer-
its of the case in the following proceeding, and in two cases, the
plaintiff was the large company and the defendant was the small
company. So that when he found in favor of the defendant, he was
hardly finding in favor of big business.
                                             573

  Turning to the specific cases, three have been criticized, or
maybe four--Subaru was mentioned in the earlier hour--Boston
Edison, Barry Wright, Kartell and Subaru. First of all, let me start
by saying that several of these cases--Boston Edison and Barry
Wright in particular--have something in common, and that is that
the plaintiff is a small company, the defendant is a large company,
and the plaintiff comes into court and says: My rival is too aggres-
sive, its prices are too low; its strategy is too aggressive, and asks
that the antitrust law remedy the losses that it is suffering in the
marketplace.

  Let me be specific. Frankly, we have heard more about price
squeeze in these hearings than the world has heard about price
squeeze in 104 years. I am aware of only two price-squeeze cases
in the nonregulated market that have ever been won by a plaintiff
in 104 years, and both those cases are 50 years old. So the fact that
Judge Breyer found against the plaintiff in a price-squeeze case is
common rather than unusual.

  In a price-squeeze case, as you heard many times over, the plain-
tiff comes in and says, I must buy from and compete with my sup-
plier. And, therefore, if my supplier makes the wholesale price too
high and its retail price too low, I get squeezed, and I cannot earn
a decent living.

  As I say, those cases are rare, and ordinarily, what the plaintiff
is saying is get the retail price up so I can do better in the market-
place. The plaintiff may win that case, but consumers will pay the
bill if the retail price goes up.

  In Boston Edison, I agree with Senator Metzenbaum that had
Judge Breyer and his colleagues found the other way around, $36
million would have gone to these two Massachusetts municipal
utilities, and I assume it would have been passed on to consumers.
But the rule of law would have been that the company exercising
the squeeze must get its prices up in order to protect the profits
of the small company, and consumers would have lost as a result
of that.

  Now, I heard today for the first time the argument that that is
not necessarily the case. An alternative would have been that the
wholesale price would come down and the retail price would stay
the same. That is not plausible in this case. The background in this
case was that Boston Electric had gotten authority to raise the
wholesale price from a Federal regulatory agency, FERC. The same
plaintiffs who came into court in the antitrust case then challenged
FERC in a judicial proceeding, and they lost there as well.

  Therefore, it seems to me that the plaintiffs had to accept the
fact that the wholesale price was fair, and the only thing left for
them to do--and I read the case as one in which this is exactly
what they did. They said get the retail price up as long as the
wholesale price is going up. Consumers would have lost.

  Barry Wright is even a clearer case because I would grant that
Boston Edison can be argued both ways. I think Breyer came out
correctly. In Barry Wright, a small company selling environmental
devices says to them, My large rival is giving 25-percent discounts,
and as a result, I cannot survive in the marketplace. But Judge
Breyer saw the point that when you start regulating how low
                                             574

prices can be, you interfere with the competitive process, and the
result is consumers do not get the benefit of the low price.

  He recognized that prices sometimes can be so low that they are
predatory and ought to be actionable, but he noted in this case that
the prices that Barry Wright was complaining about were above
full cost. And as a result, that company must have been more effi-
cient than its rival and was passing these benefits along to con-
sumers.

  Kartell, all I can say about that case is that doctors were trying
to get more money. Blue Cross was trying to keep the prices low,
and he found in favor of cost containment.

  Let me say in conclusion, the suggestion is that Judge Breyer's
opinions are arid, theoretical, impractical. I just do not see it. In
every one of these cases, the competitive process is what he is con-
cerned about. Consumer welfare is what he is concerned about. He
is skeptical of using the antitrust laws to prevent companies from
being aggressively competitive, and I do not see that as arid, theo-
retical, or impractical.

  Thank you.

  I appreciate the opportunity to testify in these hearings concerning the confirma-
tion of Stephen Breyer as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

  I intend to discuss Judge Breyer's record as a scholar and judge in the field of
antitrust. In this testimony, I will focus upon two lines of criticism that have been
directed at Judge Breyer's record: (1) it is said that in his judicial opinions, Breyer
has consistently ruled in favor of defendants, producing what has been characterized
as pro-Big Business and anti-consumer results; and (2) the results reached in sev-
eral particular cases are said to favor Big Business over the consumer.

  In light of the fact that Judge Breyer has so often reached conclusions in antitrust
cases that favor defendants, it is most appropriate for members of the Committee
to inquire carefully about this antitrust record. My own view is that his opinions,
fully examined, do not evidence any antipathy to antitrust enforcement. Certainly,
there is no Big Business bias. His opinions, of course, speak for themselves. Given
the facts before him in those cases, there is little reason to contend that he could
have reached different conclusions.

  Before turning to specifics, let me say that I have read all of Judge Breyer's anti-
trust opinions and many of his books and articles. I believe his approach to antitrust
is thoughtful and enlightened. He would leave the free market alone when it is serv-
                                             575

ing consumer interests adequately, but parts company with conservatives who be-
lieve that the market always, or almost always, does a better job of protecting con-
sumers than government regulators. I expect that Judge Breyer, if confirmed, would
be a vigorous foe of anticompetitive behavior and a powerful voice in the Supreme
Court supporting effective antitrust enforcement.

  A. The Charge of Consistent Rulings for Defendant. Of the 15 or 16 antitrust opin-
ions written by Judge Breyer, all but two were decided in favor of antitrust defend-
ants. It does not follow, however, from this numbers game that he is pro-Big Busi-
ness or anti-antitrust.

  Judge Breyer has upheld meritorious antitrust claims by both private and govern-
ment plaintiffs. In FTC v. Monahan,1 he upheld the Federal Trade Commission's
broad authority to investigate evidence of price fixing in the pharmaceutical indus-
try. In Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft,2 he upheld
a challenge under the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act to price fixing
in the sale of automobiles. I have not seen any case in which he ruled against the
government--federal or state--in an antitrust matter.

  Even in cases in which Judge Breyer found for defendants, it does not follow that
he is unsympathetic to vigorous antitrust enforcement. In several cases, the plaintiff
was a large company and the defendant was the small business, so that decisions
in favor of the defendant were hardly pro-Big Business. In many other cases, he was
deciding technical questions--whether to deny a preliminary injunction, whether a
trial judge should be recused based on conflict of interest, whether Puerto Rico
should be treated as a state or a territory--which have no significant bearing on
antitrust policy. Finally, as discussed below, his most important decisions, while fa-
voring defendants, consistently reach results that protect the vitality of competitive
markets and advance consumer interests.

   B. Criticism of Specific Decisions.3 A second charge against Judge Breyer is that
several of his decisions evidence hostility toward antitrust enforcement. The cases
cited are Town of Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990), Barry
Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 653 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1981), and Kartell v. Blue
Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922 (1984).

   While Judge Breyer did find for the defendants in all three cases, the important
point is that the decisions are consistent with enlightened antitrust interpretation
and enforcement. In addition, his decisions helped consumers in each instance.

   1. In Boston Edison, two municipal utilities that bought power from Boston Edi-
son, a large private utility, claimed that Boston Edison had engaged in a "price
squeeze" by selling power to them at a high wholesale price but selling to consumers
at a low price in competition with the municipals. The plaintiffs' complaint was that
Boston Edison was selling at retail at too low a price for them to make a profit.
If they had won out on the point, these small business plaintiffs would thrive be-
cause Boston Edison would have to raise its retail price, but consumers would end
up paying higher bills.

  A price squeeze cause of action is rarely attempted and is usually without merit,
regardless of the market in which the alleged squeeze occurred. Judge Breyer found
that such complaints are even more questionable in a market in which both the
wholesale and retail prices were set by independent regulators. A history of the pro-
ceedings shows why. Boston Electric's wholesale rates had been submitted to and
approved by FERC, a Federal regulatory agency, over the opposition of the munici-
pals. That decision in turn had been approved by the courts on review. Thus, the
plaintiffs were attempting to end-run the regulatory's decision and prior judicial re-
view by framing their complaint about wholesale prices as an antitrust cause of ac-
tion.

   As Judge Breyer noted, it is difficult for courts to decide what constitutes a fair
price and a fair profit. When independent regulators establish a "fair price," judges
in antitrust cases are understandably reluctant to reverse those decisions--espe-
cially where the result would be to raise prices to consumers.

   2. Barry Wright. In Barry Wright, a small producer of an environmental device
claimed it had been injured because Pacific, its dominate competitor, sold at " preda-
tory"--i.e., below cost--prices. In fact, the record showed that the defendant's prices
were above its full costs. Barry Wright nevertheless sued, asking the court to inter-
vene and prevent low prices to consumers. Breyer recognized that if Pacific's prices
were above its full costs, but below the full costs of rivals, it followed that it would

   1832F.2d 688 (1987).
   219 F.3d 745 (1st Cir. 1944).
   3 This portion of my testimony duplicates discussion in a letter to the Committee, dated July
5, 1994, signed by seven antitrust law professors (myself included) analyzing these decisions.
                                      576

succeed because it was more efficient than its smaller rivals and was willing to pass
efficiencies on to consumers in the form of lower prices.

  Breyer's decision in Barry Wright is part of a growing trend of judges in antitrust
cases to shy away from supporting antitrust theories that block low prices to con-
sumers. Breyer recognized that where the prices are so extremely low as to evidence
an intent to drive rivals out of business, antitrust has a role to play. But where a
company charges prices above its own full costs, it would be senseless--and anti-
consumer--for the court to intervene in order to protect less efficient businesses. A
few years after Judge Breyer's opinion, the Supreme Court in effect ratified his deci-
sion and similar decisions in other circuits that prices above full costs are not preda-
tory, noting that a claim of predatory pricing can only be sustained when the chal-
lenged prices are below some standard of cost Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 113 Sup. Ct. 2578, 2588 (1993).

  3. Kartell. In the Kartell case, a group of physicians challenged Blue Shield be-
cause it extracted from participating doctors a promise not to charge patients an
amount above the insurance fee paid by Blue Shield. A lower court had found that
the effect of the arrangement was to pay doctors at unreasonably low levels and
therefore was an agreement in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the
Sherman Act.

  Judge Breyer found that Blue Shield was not a collection of "buyers," capable of
conspiring, but rather an independent single force, and that single buyers have a
right under the antitrust laws to bargain for the lowest price available. While the
defendant once again won in a Breyer opinion, the real effect was to sustain cost-
containment efforts by a major insurer and to prevent doctors from charging higher
prices to their patients.

  C. Conclusion. Judge Breyer stands well within the mainstream of modern anti-
trust analysis. He is trained and sophisticated in the use of economics, but does not
see economics as the exclusive concern of competition policy. He understands that
antitrust incorporates a concern for fairness and justice to large and small business,
and has an overriding view that those laws should be enforced in order to serve the
welfare of consumers.

  There is another dimension to Judge Breyer's opinions that deserve comment. His
opinions in antitrust, a complicated subject at best, are as clear, sharp and well or-
ganized as any judicial opinions in the federal system. Judge Breyer appreciates
that individuals and firms, to obey the law and function effectively must be given
fair notice of what the law is. He summed up his concern and indicated his ap-
proach in a comment in Boston Edison, discussed earlier:

        [Antitrust rules are court administered rules. They must be clear enough
     for lawyers to explain them to their clients. They must be administratively
     workable and therefore cannot always take account of every complex eco-
     nomic circumstances or qualification.
  It is true that Judge Breyer is less likely to support interventionist antitrust theo-
ries than some Supreme Court judges in the 1960s. For example, he is unlikely to
support inhibitions on aggressive competitive tactics by large companies so that less
efficient small business will thrive, especially when the consequence of that kind of
intervention is higher prices to consumers. But when it comes to the mainstream
of current antitrust enforcement--challenges to cartel behavior, to large mergers
that produce substantial anticompetitive effects, to restrictions on the freedom of
distributors to select products and set prices as they see fit--I expect that Judge
Breyer will be strong supporter of effective antitrust enforcement Indeed, the very
fact that he understands this area so well should make him an especially effective
advocate within the Court for sensible enforcement

                  STATEMENT OF CASS R. SUNSTEIN
  Mr. SUNSTEIN. Thank you, Senator. It is an honor to be here.
  I, too, support this nominee, and I believe that his work in the
area of regulation is superb. For those who are concerned about his
work in this area, especially in the area of the environment and
health and safety, it is probably important to emphasize that Judge
Breyer distinguishes very sharply between his role as a judge and
his role as a policy adviser.
                                              577

  In his capacity as a judge, he has carried out the instructions of
Congress and the will of administrative agencies. He has been a
very vigorous enforcer in the sense of he has been very faithful to
Congress' own judgments that the environment needs protection.
So when he has written as a policy adviser, that is what he has
done. And when he has written as a judge, he has not compromised
congressional judgments by his own policy views.

  Nonetheless, some concerns have been raised about Judge
Breyer's views on regulations, so I would like to say just a few
words about his work in that area in which he is very widely re-
spected.

  Judge Breyer's general attitude toward regulation is highly prag-
matic, and in a specific sense, he is very focused on the real world.
He is not highly theoretical. His interest is, What do regulations
do for the people who are supposed to benefited by them? And to
this end, he has looked very empirically at whether agencies make
the world better or worse. He has not bashed regulatory agencies
in the least. On the contrary, he has found many instances in
which regulatory agencies have done a very good job. He is not op-
posed to regulation as a general rule. He believes that in many
areas regulation is indispensable. Indeed, he sometimes describes
deregulation as--and this is a direct quote--"a. non-solution."

  I think because of his pragmatism in the sense of no big theories
but attention to consequences, it is because of his pragmatism that
he is so widely respected. Most generally in regulation, he sought
deregulation and reliance on antitrust law where he thinks the
market will work. His very famous work with Senator Kennedy
and, in fact, Ralph Nader on airline deregulation is based on the
judgment that market competition will work in the area of airlines
because it will lower prices and improve services as compared with
Government price fixing. This is a judgment supported by facts and
evidence, and while a Tot of people raise questions about the cur-
rent status of airline transportation, there is no question that de-
regulation has brought about many significant gains.

  In the area of health and safety, he is against deregulation. He
could not be clearer on that. He believes we need Government
standards, taxes or fines, and a very significant Government role.
What his special concern has been is to ensure that we have a good
sense of priorities, that we devote our limited resources to areas in
which a lot of lives are at stake rather than to areas in which a
few lives are at stake.

  Now, there have been a number of concerns raised about Judge
Breyer's most recent book. Senator Biden has raised some con-
cerns, and the last panel raised a number of concerns. Let me just
offer a few notations on the latest book in order maybe to put it
in a more general perspective.

  As I have noted, this is a book which is very sharply opposed to
deregulation. This is not a free-market book in the least. He has
a paragraph in which he dismisses deregulation. This is a book in
which he catalogues successes, areas in which agencies have saved
human life at low cost. He is not opposed to the EPA, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, or anything of the sort.

  His basic goal has been to ensure that more is done in the way
of savings lives rather than less is done in saving lives. And to that
                                      578
end, he has suggested that we ought to adopt some mechanism by
which Government can transfer resources from small problems to
large problems. It is very pragmatic, highly common-sensical.

  Some people have suggested that the notion is not democratic.
With respect to this question, it is important to note that any
power that Judge Breyer suggests agencies should have would be
exercised within congressional limits. On that he is crystal clear,
that there is no increase in executive power over such power as the
agencies now have. This approach involving more protection of life
rather than less, a body of experts who would ensure that result
would Judge Breyer thinks the public would like, is a policy rec-
ommendation offered as an experiment. And Judge Breyer is also
very clear that this is an experimental idea and not an idea set in
stone.

  Let me conclude by suggesting that Judge Breyer's work on the
law as opposed to policy makes crystal clear that his basic judg-
ment is that law is for courts, policy is for agencies and Congress.
Policy judgments, he has said, in the environmental area, every-
where else, are not judicial business, and he has criticized some
courts for being too activist in that regard.

  This is an especially distinguished appointment to the Supreme
Court, really an extraordinary appointment to the Supreme Court,
and the Court itself will be better with Judge Breyer on it.

Jurisprudence, Law School and Department of Political Science, University
of Chicago.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the C r o m i t t e * :

        I am pleased to have the opportmiaity to appear before you today to
discuss Judge Stephen Breyer's yrotk « c a regulatory policy and
administrative law. I win restrict myscttiif to these subjects. I will give
particular emphasis to Judge Breyeri becooks, Regulation and ita Reform
(1982) and Brgalriny the Vicious Circl* 1.1998). I will spend some time as
well on Judge Breyer's other acadenu: T-work; but I will deal only briefly
with his judicial opinions, which by nzeesessity offer a less detailed and
sustained statement of his views.

        Let me begin with some general miotes, offered by way of summary.
For many years, Judge Breyer has bes* ci one of the most valuable writers on
regulation and administrative law. & ^ is an unfailingly constructive, fair-
minded, and sophisticated contributor ~.z zo public and academic discussion.
Avoiding dogmatism and ideology, he ^ .z highly pragmatic; for this reason
he appeals to people of widely varying ~ n e w g . A special virtue of his work is
that he focuses insistently on the real-^world consequences of law.

        With respect to regulation, his :r-~ief goal has been to develop
approaches that will actually impr.vc ,=t>e<jple's lives, by (for example)
reducing prices, promoting employment. :, improving the quality of services,
or increasing health and safety. H? :? 2 not "anti-regulation" or "pro-
remulation." Instead he seeks souz.d r?rzruls::m. whsre soundness is
evaluated with close reference to wb*: ~ regulation does in the actual world.
Thus Judge Breyer was sympathetic s -- deregulation in some areas of
transportation, urging competition wenesr.nng airlines to keep prices down. But
he sharply opposes deregulation in the s^areas of health and safety, claiming
that marketplace forces are insuffioBXELZ.

        With respect to administratrre la-aaw. Judge Breyer has tried to work
out a sensible understanding of the r^--ationa among courts, agencies,
Congress, and the President. His work. 11 is characterized by appreciation of
the constitutional backdrop, health? rr^ragmatism, attention to actual
effects, appreciation for experimec_t£=c=3ii, and good common sense. His
work shows that he believes that his trr=unary obligation as a judge is to the
law. He understands that his own jrirrrnients about regulatory policy
should not determine hia int«rpret^.t^-- z. of the law.

        No one in these complex, techi_^_al. and often controversial fields is
likely to agree with everything tha-r iiz=.nge Breyer has written or said.
Reasonable people have reasonable d^2«agreexnents. But there can be no
doubt that Judge Breyer has been az. fsrxceptjonally valuable contributor in
current debates. His work on gover^=.er.ent regulation and administrative
law is unusually distinyiish+d In part because of bis expwtia* aad
·ophiaticatioa in these fields, he would be ·& superb addition to UM
Supreme Court.

                                L Regulation in General

        Judge Breyer's first book, Regulation and its Reform (1982), offers a
comprehensive overview of the subject. The book is a careful, fair-minded,
and Kaianoad discussion of regulation. It seeks particularly to identify the
regulatory tool* that will best promote our common economic, social, and
environmental goals. This is a detailed and sophisticated book, one that
defies simple summary. I offer a brief outline here.

        Judge Breyer's principal complaint is that we have not always
sought regulatory tools that are well-matched to regulatory problems. For
example, if the regulatory problem is natural monopoly, the best regulatoiy
tool is coet-of-service ratemajdng, which can keep consumer costs at the
optimal place. If the problem is excessive competition, the best tool is
antitrust law, which can prevent predatory behavior. The question of
"match" and "mismatch" is the basic theme of the book. In urging good
matches between problem and solution, Judge Breyer seeks regulatory
approaches that will actually work, and that will do so without increasing
prices, promoting unemployment, harming economic productivity, or.
endangering other important social goals.

       Judge Breyer favors deregulation in certain limited but important
circumstances - especially when the evidence suggests that competition,
rather than government mandates or government price-fixing, will benefit
consumers and the public at large. His approval of airline deregulation
grows out of the view that airlines can be mads to compete with one
another, and that if so, government should not set prices for airline tickets.
(There was evidence, receiving bipartisan support, that government price-
fixing resulted in unnecessarily high prices for consumers.) Judge Breyer
thinks that "excessive competition" is rarely (though not never) a problem;
most of the time, so-called "excessive" competition helps consumers and
the economy, by lowering prices and improving services. Thus he favors
reliance on the antitrust laws to ensure that airlines are truly competing
with one another, rather than use of governmental controls to determine
prices and services. In short, Judge Breyer urges policymakers to use the
marketplace where the marketplace will work.

        But Judge Breyer rejects deregulation when he believes that it will
fail. His book shows that he is certainly not a member of the so-called
Chicago School, which tends to see government failure &s pervasive, and to
treat deregulation as invariably the remedy of choice. In this way, Judge
Breyer does not follow the views expressed by the most prominent and
severe critics of regulation. In this book, he claims that deregulation would
be a failure in many areas of social and economic life.

        In the context of unhealthy or dangerous food and drugs, for
example. Judge Breyer notes that ordinary people usually lack information
about risks. A government role is therefore indispensable. It may be best for
government merely to provide the relevant information; it may be best for
government to ban certain risk-producing substances "where disclosure
does not work." Id. at 193. There is a separate problem for many social
harms, which involve "spillover costs." Id. at 192. With many products, the
price that is charged does not reflect the harm that is actually inflicted, and
here laissez-faire would be a mistake. Id. at 192-93. Taxes and fines may be
the best solution for this problem, or perhaps government should set
minimum standards.

        Hence in the area of environmental protection, Judge Breyer
suggests that the principal choice is not between regulation and no
regulation, but between governmentally-set standards on the one hand and
economic incentives (taxes or fines) on the other. Judge Breyer offers a
detailed discussion of the risks and benefits associated with these various
                   581

strategies. (I might add at thiB point that Judge Breyer's general if cautious
support far economic incentives has now received considerable bipartisan
approval. President Clinton's Executive Order on Regulation supports
economic incentives, as did Presidents Reagan and Bush, and as does the
well-respected environmental group, the Environmental Defense Fund. In
the 1990 Clean Air Act, Congress made the same judgment in controlling
acid deposition.)

       Judge Breyer also urges government to follow some general precepts:
to be modest, to aim at the worst cases, and to aim for simplicity. He is
concerned that some regulation may cause problems as bad as or worse
than the disease, and he ^eeks approaches that will actually work in the
wcrld, rather than prove futile or counterproductive, or amount to symbolic
posturing that does little good. All in all, Judge Breyer's analysis of the
problem of regulatory "mismatch" is subtle, sophisticated, detailed, and
refreshingly nondogmatic.

        Regulation and its Reform has proved to be a highly influential and
extremely constructive contribution to academic and public debate. Of
course the book in not the last word on the subject. Certainly it is possible to
question some of its analysis and some of its conclusions. But the book has
become something of a classic, and quite deservedly so.

                      XL Health, Safety, and the Environment

       I have said that in the area of safety, health, and the environment,
Judge Breyer is sharply opposed to deregulation. In recent years his basic
concern has been to ensure that our limited resources will be devoted to
areas where they will do the most good. This is a large theme of his first
book, and it is the principal goal of his latest book. Breaking the Vicious
Ckcjfi (1993).

In th» ;~oook Judge Breyer is not concerned with how much w * should

be spending a t n health, safety, and the environment. Instead he is asking

how we shoLui-d allocate our resources for these purposes, a*umm<ny that,

th qfl  - fixed. In investigagting this iss, ue, Judgge Breyer identifies a

large problem -.: the apparently Targe expenditure of resources for relatively

small probl=SL£, and the failure to devote significant or sufficient resources

to relatively ozarge problems. This problem has been found by many

observers *""»-" many different perspectives, and it is supported by the

standard at wwiim from both government and the private sector. See, e.g., W.

K VLscusi, y»»toi Tx»Htv»ffi» nooay and sources cited; C.R. Sunstein, Altar.

the Rights I#*»volnrion (1990), Appendix B, and sources cited; Regulatory

and sources ^ i d

                BoJreyer'B book is no attack on government regulation. On the
contrary, J-aezsge Breyer insists that regulation is necessary, and that
deregulaucc -i.xa a "nonsolution." Id. at 56. He even contends that some
popular lest -^restrictive alternatives, like labelling and taxes, may well be
inadequate Ii_i. at 56.

        Judg* JBJBreyer'a basic claim is that we can rearrange our priorities so
as to do m s c i a more to promote health and safety. His comparison of saved
lives with c s s z s is designed to ensure that we have more gains, not that we
trade offing .z and dollars in some mechanical fashion. See id. at 22-28.
Thus he sL-*.-r>s that much regulation is highly successful, saving lives and
protecting ;=- -e environment at comparatively low cost, see id. at 24. Thus he
urges that ~>?e- s might improve our regulatory outcomes through, for
example, k r s e r prenatal care; increased vaccinations; better cancer
diagnosis. -----roves-ients in indoor climates; changes in diet to avoid
natural czrz iogens; spending more government time and effort on such
                                         582

serious ccncspgical problems as ozone, forest destruction, and climate
chance; an£ ---m«c*i more. Id. at 23, 28. Judge Breyer draws on some recent
work by tbs ^-Environmental Protection Agency to show that attention to
priorities a s j i help ensure that we devote our resources to the most serious
problems, c c d thus do a lot of good, rather than more minor problems, and
thus do lea z=good.

        ID sliif^rt, the basic problem addressed by Breaking *Htt Vicious Circle
- a problem --- of whose existence there can be no doubt - is inadequate
priority-se...r ,-ng and inadequate allocation of limited regulatory resources.
Judge Brej^r r believes that the American public wants those resources to
increase pr---s to life and health. He does not think that the present
inadequate 3 ilocations really reflect the public will. Thus he seeks solutions
that will d: ---what the public most deeply seeks ~ to save many lives and
protect hexl~zh and the environment, without damaging the economy.

        To r^ersreome the current misallocations, Judge Breyer offers a
straightfors^rsrd but innovative proposal. This is a new institution, one that
would aperszs-ze within the executive branch and always remain subject to
the law as enacted by Congress. The purpose of the institution would be
simple: to help ensure better priority-setting. Thus its members would have
expertise in science and technology and receive experience in many places,
including EPA, Congress, and elsewhere. Id. at 71. The new institution
would be authorized to ensure good priority-setting, by allocating resources
to serious problems rather than trivial ones, and thus by saving more lives
rather than fewer.

        This is an intriguing and provocative proposal. It is not
unprecedented or radical. On the contrary, it draws on some important
precedents in the United States and abroad. Notably, officials in both the
Bush and the Clinton administrations have expressed considerable interest
in the proposal. The proposal also raises many questions, some of which
are addressed by Judge Breyer itself, and some of which require further
consideration. I cannot discuss those questions here. But it is important to
emphasize that the proposal has already attracted a great deal of bipartisan
interest, finding support among liberals and conservatives alike. Much of
its analysis is reflected, for example, in the recent report of the Carnegie
Commission, Pigfe STtd thft Enviropinf>wt-i Improving ftftgulatorv Decision
Mgkjsg_(1993). It is notable that the authors of that report were
exceptionally diverse.

        I conclude that Breaking the Vicious Circle is an unusually valuable
and illuminating book. Like many likely readers, I do not agree with
everything that is said in the book. Surely we can quarrel with some of
Judge Breyer's particular claims, especially in areas involving such a high
degree of scientific uncertainty. Surely we can urge modifications and
qualifications to his provocative proposal. Perhaps the proposal should
ultimately be rejected (though I think that it is far too socn to make such a
judgment). What is important for present purposes is that Judge Erejer
has offered a highly promising suggestion for the future. The book is a
constructive and informed effort to address a significant problem with
modern regulation.

                                 m . Administrative Law

        Judge Breyer's work on administrative law has been concerned not
with substantive policy, but with the appropriate relations among our
various governmental actors - Congress, courts, the President, and federal
agencies. He believes in a limited role for the judges, seeing regulatory
policy as, fundamentally, a decision for others, especially Congress and
regulatory agencies. See, e.g., Afterword, 92 Yale LJ 1614 (1983). Here too
Judge Breyer has donefirst-ratework. This work is perhaps most relevant
                                             583

to these confirmation proceedings, since it suggests Judge Breyer's views
en the function of the judiciary.

        For present purposes, two of Judge Breyer's essays are especially
notable. On the Usee of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes. 65 S.
Cal. L. Rev. 845 (1992), sharply criticizes the view that legislative history is
irrelevant to statutory interpretation. Judge Breyer urges that legislative
history has some limited but important functions for judges. His basic
claim is that the history helps uncover Congress' instructions, and to that
extent legislative history bears on judicial work. He shows that the history
may help courts to avoid absurd outcomes that Congress has not intended;
that it may help reveal drafting errors; that it may show that Congress
wrote with a specialized meaning that courts should respect. Perhaps most
important, the history may reveal that Congress has sought to promote an
identifiable purpose and that a particular interpretation was Congress'
own.

        Judge Breyer does not believe that courts should search the
legislative history in support offragmentaryquotations establishing the
court's preferred policy view. But he thinks that when there is room for
interpretive doubt, the history con be a real help. This is a balanced,
modest, moderate, and highly intelligent discussion. It shows an
appreciation for possible abuses of legislative history, but also responds well
to people who think that the history should be abandoned. In Judge Breyer's
view, the proper answer to abuse is to stop the abuse, not to drop reliance on
the history altogether. Reasonable people may claim that Judge Breyer has
not struck the right balance; but the article is a fine one.

        Also notable is Judicial, Rgyiew of Question* of IJIW and Policy. 38 Ad.
L. Rev. 363 (1986). Here Judge Breyer draws attention to Supreme Court
cases apparently suggesting (quite oddly) that courts should carefully
review policy judgments by agencies, but should defer to agency judgments
about the meaning of law. Judge Breyer says that this is an anomalous and
unstable set of ideas, since courts are better suited to Interpreting law, and
pocrly suited to assessing policy. Judge Breyer emphasize? that courts are
not weil-equipped to make policy judgments, since they lack a
comprehensive overview of agency objectives and options. Judge Breyer also
offers a highly sophisticated discussion of the problem of deciding when
courts should defer to agency interpretations of law. He shows that this is a
complex or subtle problem, not easily answered by general rule. This is an
 excellent article too, and it has been quite influential.

        My principal task here is to discuss Judge Breyer's scholarship in
regulatory policy and administrative law, and I will not discuss his judicial
work in detail. But I will note that as a judge, Judge Breyer has been a
faithful interpreter of federal regulatory law. To take just one example, he
has strongly supported the goals of the National Environmental Policy Act
 (NEPA). In two especially influential opinions, be emphasizes the need to
 consider environmental consequences before decisions are actually made,
 and in this way he has remained faithful to Congress' initial goals in
 enacting NEPA. See Siarra Club v. Marsh. 769 F.2d 868 (1st Cir. 1989J;
 rot^rmweaith of Massachusetts v. Watt. 716 F.2d 946 Cist Cir. 1983). The
rest of his judicial work on administrative law and regulation reflects first-
 rate legal skills and respect for governmental institutions and the law.

         A reading of Judge Breyer's work shows that he certainly does not
impose his policy preferences on the law. He has revealed a strong
 commitment to a limited role for the judiciary, safeguarding the
 lawmaking prerogatives of Congress and the policymaking powers of the
President and regulatory agencies. This approach is highly consistent with
 his academic writings.
                                          584

         For a long period, Judge Breyer haa been one of the most valuable
commentators on administrative law and regulatory policy. He is widely
respected and discussed. His work is highly pragmatic, and he is always
focussed on real-world consequences. Avoiding dogmatism, abstraction,
and high theory, he cannot be characterized as "for" or "against"
regulation in general. Instead he is aware that regulation can fail or
succeed, and he tries to urge strategies that will actually work, and that
will do so while minimally burdening the economy.

        His work on administrative law - probably more relevant for present
purposes - is characterized by a sensible understanding of the strengths
and limits of different institutions in the federal government. Hence he
urges a limited role for courts, especially in overseeing policy judgments in
the regulatory area. But he also insists that courts have an important
function in ensuring that agencies have complied with the law as enacted
by Congress.

        Let me add some final words. Judge Breyer has done his work on
regulation not in his judicial capacity, but as> an academic and as a policy
adviser. There is every reason to think that as a Justice, he would not
attempt tc "legislate from the bench" by reading statures in accurdance %-»th
his own policy preferences. Judge Breyer's work as an academic and as a
judge shows that he is fully aware of the sharp limitations ofjudges in our
system of government. In interpreting the law, he has been concerned
above all with Congress' instructions, not with his own theories. I think
that with his evident skills, unusual expertise, and sense of balance and
fair-mindedness, Judge Breyer would be a truly extraordinary addition to
the Supreme Court. This is an <«Htfag and distinguished nominee. I very
much hope that he will be confirmed.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I apologize, Professor Pitofsky, for not being here while you were
here, and, Cass, it is great to see you.
  I assume Ms. Matthews has not spoken yet. Correct?

   Ms. MATTHEWS. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank Senator Kennedy for chairing
this. I have a slight scheduling problem. The reason I was out is
we were trying to work out a matter on the crime bill between the
House and the Senate, and I apologize for not being here.

  Because I am going to have to leave before 5 o'clock, probably
about 4:55, before the last panel speaks, I want to indicate for the
press that is here what the schedule will be for the remainder of
consideration of the Breyer nomination. We will now question this
panel and the next panel--and the next panel is a very important
panel as well because they represent the various bar associations
that have done an awful lot of work on this, and other nominations,
and we have come to rely on their judgment a lot.

  We will then close the hearing, and we will have an executive
session in which we will vote in committee, assuming no Senator
exercises his or her right to hold it over for a week--I have no no-
tion anyone will do that--at the latest by next Thursday, possibly
as early as Tuesday. I want to confer with the ranking member
who I believe is, along with his colleagues, ready to accommodate
a Tuesday executive committee meeting. To translate, that means
we get to vote on Judge Breyer in committee on Tuesday, I hope,
but the latest, Thursday.

  If we vote on Tuesday, it is my expectation, absent any opposi-
tion--and I know of none--we would De voting on Judge Breyer on
the floor as early as the end of next week, but I expect no later
than the beginning of the following week.

  I do not know if that is at all helpful to the press, who always
get stuck having to cover these details, but that is what my expec-
tation is.

  Now, Ms. Matthews, again, I apologize for the interruption, and
the floor is yours.

                STATEMENT OF MARTHA MATTHEWS
  Ms. MATTHEWS. Thank you. It is a privilege to be here, Senator
Biden, Senator Kennedy.
  First, I have to offer a disclaimer. I know absolutely nothing
about antitrust or regulation.
  The CHAIRMAN. That qualifies you, with the exception of Senator
Kennedy and a few others, to be a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
  Ms. MATTHEWS. I am not sure if that is a disappointment or a
relief. [Laughter.]
  I am a civil rights lawyer and poverty lawyer. I am a staff attor-
ney at the National Center for Youth Law, which is a legal services
national backup center specializing in legal issues affecting poor
children and families. What I actually do is mostly class action liti-
gation on behalf of foster children, and other litigation and admin-
istrative advocacy related to benefit levels, children's access to
health care, and other vital legal issues affecting poor children. So
                                      593
I am not qualified to speak on the debate that we have just heard
on antitrust and regulation.

  The reason that I think that I was asked to testify today is be-
cause several years ago I had the rare opportunity to work both
with Judge Breyer and with the distinguished Justice that he was
nominated to replace. I served as a law clerk for Judge Breyer from
1988 to 1989. I served as a law clerk for Justice Blackmun from
1989 to 1990. And so I had the somewhat unique opportunity to be
there on a day-to-day basis at the elbow of each one of these jurists
and see what they do every day.

  So I would like to direct my remarks not so much to their overall
jurisprudence. You have heard law professors who are far more ex-
perienced than I to do that, but as to what Judge Breyer was like
on a day-to-day basis, what he was like working

  The CHAIRMAN. Did you write the Ottati opinion? [Laughter.]
  Ms. MATTHEWS. Law clerks do not write opinions.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know. Maybe you are the one we should have
speaking to all this time.
  Ms. MATTHEWS. I am sure that any fatal errors in antitrust opin-
ions are entirely--well, I cannot say they are due to mistakes of
law clerks, because he checks everytning that we write so carefully.
  Actually, the biggest case that I researched for Judge Breyer dur-
ing the year I was there was a case about futures trading on the
London options market, something I knew nothing about before I
came and I knew nothing about after I left, either.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, he has made an Anglophile of almost all of
us since we have had to learn about Lloyd's of London.
  Ms. MATTHEWS. I was saddened to hear of Justice Blackmun's re-
tirement, but I cannot think of anyone better qualified to replace
him than Judge Breyer. Like Justice Blackmun, he cannot be eas-
ily labeled as a liberal or conservative judge. His views on cases
have never been predetermined by any political agenda. Nobody
could accurately say about him that he always rules for the plain-
tiff in a civil rights case or always rules for the Government in a
criminal case or any such generalization.
  Judge Breyer has shared with Justice Blackmun a profound com-
mitment to judge each case fairly as it comes before him, with rig-
orous honesty, intellectual clarify, lack of bias, and with a deep re-
spect for the limits of judicial authority.
  It is striking to me that Judge Breyer has been nominated to re-
place Justice Blackmun because there are some profound
similarities between them, even though their temperaments are
quite different.
  Again, like Justice Blackmun, Judge Breyer has never forgotten
that each case that comes before a Federal court is of great impor-
tance to the parties involved in the case and to other people who
are going to be affected by the decision in the case. Each case he
has treated with
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW do you know that? People say that. But did
either of the judges ever turn to you and the clerks and say, By
the way, Martha, keep in mind when you look at these cases--I
mean, when you--how do you know that?
  Ms. MATTHEWS. Well, in Judge Breyer*s case, by the rigorous at-
tention he has paid to the record. Judge Breyer makes sure that
                                      594
every--I mean, the records sent to the Federal circuits are volumi-
nous. He is familiar with every page of those records, makes sure
that we really understand how the case came about, who the par-
ties are, what happened to them, what is going to happen to them
if they win or if they lose.

  I do not think that he is the kind of judge that takes a case as
an opportunity to explore some academic legal theory or to write
a Law Review article, you know, in the guise of a judicial opinion.
I think that he profoundly cares what happens to the people in the
cases.

  That is shown, for example, by the tone of his questioning at oral
argument, and like Justice Blackmun, in fact, is famous. The ques-
tions that he asks at oral argument show that kind of concern for
what is going to happen as a result of this case.

  Another thing that I would like to say about oral argument is
that one thing that deeply impressed me as I watched arguments
before Judge Breyer is the respect and courtesy that he treated the
lawyers who argued the cases with. Not everyone who appears be-
fore a Federal circuit court of appeals is brilliant. Some of them are
eloquent. Some of them stumble over their words. Some of them
drop their papers off the podium.

  Every single lawyer who comes before him gets a fair chance to
plead his cause. His questions to the lawyers show that he is pre-
pared on their cases. He genuinely wants to hear what they have
to say and wants to give them a fair chance. And I think that that
is one of the most profound ways in which a judge as a public fig-
ure can show respect for the law and show respect even for the po-
sitions of lawyers with whom he disagrees.

  Another thing I would like to comment on is--this may be pro-
saic, but the hours that Judge Breyer works. He is there every day.
He is completely prepared on each case. The cases that are argued
before the court, he is fully briefed. He sits on the bench, under-
standing each case, and I am not talking about interesting--well,
to me, interesting cases. I am saying that the same amount of at-
tention to detail goes into a case on, say, the proper interpretation
of a Social Security regulation as to a cutting-edge issue of first
amendment law that his law clerks find fascinating. And that gave
me a deep sense of respect for him, that it did not matter if a case
seemed to my mind to be boring. He would believe that it deserved
the same amount of respect and the same amount of detail.

  But in spite of the kind of standards that he held himself to, I
would also like to say that he was a joy to work for. He was always
courteous and polite to his clerks. He was fascinating to talk to in
conversation. We used to--Judge Breyer has a taste for sweets, and
we used to leave cookies out on the table in the room where we
worked as clerks so that we could sort of tempt him to come in and
sit down and talk to us. We called this "judge bait." We would al-
ways leave out judge bait because, no matter what subject that you
talked to him on, he had something fascinating to say. And he had
a broad range of interests beyond the subjects on which he has
written books. It was amazing the number of areas of legal scholar-
ship that he kept up with.

  I do not want to take too much time with personal reminiscences,
but that has always stood out to me. ·
                                      595

  The CHAIRMAN. They are worthy reminiscences, and one of the
things that is important--it has been clearly established, I think,
but you have reinforced it--is his temperament and his concern for
the litigants and the way in which he treats those before him. That
is an important consideration.

  I thank you for your testimony, and, again, I thank Senator Ken-
nedy and apologize to the last panel for not being able to be here,
but I appreciate your testimony.

  [The prepared statement of Ms. Matthews follows:]

  PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARTHA MATTHEWS IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF

                        JUDGE STEPHEN BREYER TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

  Thank you for the opportunity to appear and present testimony before this Com-
mittee. My name is Martha Matthews; I currently work as a staff attorney at the
National Center for Youth Law, a national support center for legal aid attorneys fo-
cusing on issues affecting poor children and families.

  I believe that I was asked to testify today because, several years ago, I had the
rare good fortune to work both for Judge Breyer and for the distinguished Justice
he has been nominated to replace. I served as a law clerk for Judge Breyer from
1988 to 1989, and for Justice Blackmun from 1989 to 1990. As a law clerk, I had
the opportunity to work closely with Judge Breyer at the First Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, performing legal research, reviewing the case records, and discussing with
Judge Breyer the cases argued before that court.

  Although I was saddened to hear of Justice Blackmun's retirement, I cannot think
of anyone better suited to take his place than Judge Breyer. Like Justice Blackmun,
he cannot be easily labeled as a "liberal" or "conservative" judge, because his views
on cases are never predetermined by a set political agenda. Nobody could accurately
say about him, he always rules for the plaintiff in a civil rights case, or he always
rules for the government in criminal cases, or any similar generalization. Judge
Breyer shares with Justice Blackmun a profound commitment to judge each case
fairly as it comes before him, with rigorous honesty, intellectual clarity, lack of any
bias or preconception, and with a deep respect for the limits of judicial authority.

  Like Justice Blackmun, Judge Breyer has never forgotten that each case that
comes into federal court is of great importance to the parties involved, and to other
people who may be affected by it. Each case is treated with the same high standards
of thoroughness and clarity--whether it involves a cutting-edge First Amendment
issue, or an arcane Social Security regulation. Each litigant receives a judicial opin-
ion written clearly, thoughtfully, and in language he or she can understand (and
without any footnotes!), explaining the basis for the decision rendered. Each lawyer
who appears at oral argument before Judge Breyer, whether brilliant or stumbling,
is treated with respect and courtesy, and is given a fair chance to plead his cause.

  Judge Breyer, like Justice Blackmun, habitually works long hours to ensure that
he is fully prepared for every case heard by the Court, and that every detail of every
opinion is accurate, every sentence clear and well-crafted every legal theory ex-
plored. Yet, during the year I worked for him, Judge Breyer somehow also found
time to teach, to lecture, to serve on numerous committees, and to keep abreast of
developments in legal scholarship in many areas. His dedication to a life of public
service has been an inspiration to me in my own work.

  Yet despite the rigorous standards to which he holds himself, Judge Breyer was
a joy to work for, courteous to his clerks and staff, gracious and engaging in con-
versation, with a broad range of interests and talents.

  I would like to share with you a memory of Judge Breyer that I will always treas-
ure. On a cold winter night in 1989, after a long day of work, Judge Breyer still
found the time and energy to attend a Valentine's day party at my house, to sit on
the floor with us and make construction-paper valentines for his children. This
memory assures me that the application of Judge Breyer's formidable intellect to
the cases that come before the Supreme Court will always be tempered with warmth
and compassion, with a keen awareness of how the lofty decisions of judges affect
the everyday lives of the people of this nation.

  It is a privilege to be here, to express my admiration for Judge Breyer and to ap-
plaud his nomination to the Supreme Court. Thank you.

the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, then for Judge [now
Chief Judge] Stephen Breyer in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and
finally for Justice Harry A. Blackmun in the U.S. Supreme Court.

  In fall 1990, Ms. Matthews returned to California to work as a staff attorney at
Legal Services for Children in San Francisco. She represented inner city children
in Abuse/Neglect cases, guardianship and emancipation petitions, and other civil

  The CHAIRMAN. I would yield to Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Thank you very much.
  That was fascinating insight, Ms. Matthews. I do not think over
the time I have been on the committee we have probably had the
kinds of recollections both in terms of work habits, personal kinds
of insights that you have about Judge Breyer. I would certainly, in
the time that I have known him, agree with all the characteriza-
tions that you have made. I think the seriousness with which he
addresses these matters, the work habits, his consideration of peo-
ple, his real interest in the impact of the decision on real people.
I think you have commented on it, and it is certainly something
that I have noted. And I think those of us who have watched him
as a judge have certainly seen it as well. I think that will be enor-
mously important in the work on the Court, so we thank you for
those insights.
  Let me ask just very briefly, Professor Sunstein, could you tell
us, with Judge Breyer's legal philosophy, what your sense is about
the issues in protecting health and safety that will come to him in
different forms and shapes that will come to the Supreme Court?
If people were to ask you what in his background, his writings, and
his decisions that should give us some satisfaction on those issues
relating to health and safety, that he has demonstrated a real com-
mitment to assuring the rights of individuals in those two impor-
tant areas?
  Mr. SUNSTEIN. I will give you a specific answer and then a gen-
eral answer. The specific answer has to do with the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act, which is sometimes thought to be the Magna
Carta of the environmental movement. It says that every agency
before it takes action that might affect the environment has to pre-
pare a careful environmental impact statement.
  Now, Judge Breyer in two cases has said that if the Government
fails to do that when it has to, the court will issue an injunction
to stop the Government from going forward with its act.
  Now, he has been somewhat unusual--not by any means out of
the mainstream--but somewhat unusual in allowing the injunction
to go forward. The idea that he has spoken for is that the Govern-
ment has to consider the environmental impact before the action is
taken, and that means that we cannot wait for the environmental
impact statement to be prepared while the action is taken; he has
insisted the injunction will stop the Government from acting until
it has considered the environmental impact.
  Now, that, I think, is a signal of how seriously he takes environ-
mental issues and a signal of how seriously he takes his under-
standing of congressional purposes. That is the specific answer.
  The more general answer is he is first and foremost dedicated to
faithful interpretation of the law. So the key question is what have
you, what has Congress, instructed the courts to do, and the agen-
                                      598
cies to do. That is why he is so insistent that legislative history
plays a role in statutory interpretation. For him, the principal role
of the judge is to make sure that Congress' instructions have been
complied with, and these cases involving issuing injunctions, stop-
ping Government from acting until the environmental impact has
been considered, those are testimony to that judgment of his.

  Senator KENNEDY. I know we did not go into with Judge Breyer
on the old issue--some of my other colleagues did--of interpreting
statutes and also interpreting some of the discussions and debates.
I can think of a case that is so clear, and that is the Grove City
case, where, rather than looking at the particularity of the words
in the statute, if the Court had ever looked at what this institution
had been doing for a whole period of time, that is, not permitting
taxpayer money to be used in a discriminatory way--that is just
boilerplate from the period of the 1960's on. And as you remember,
in that case, since there was not discrimination in the financial of-
fice, it did not make any difference whether there was discrimina-
tion in the hiring or the treatment of, in this case, women at Grove
City. They said, well, there is no discrimination in the office where
the money is going. And that is really what Congress--because look
at these words--rather than looking at what was stated in the floor
debates, what was stated in terms of the legislative history and in
the perspective of the actions that had been taken by Congress in
a period of time where, as a policy matter, they were not going to
permit taxpayers' money to be used in a way that would permit
discriminatory action.

  There were some references, certainly, to the value of looking
just, at a time when there was confusion about particular words,
at some of the other factors in terms of the history. Of course, we
overrode that case for that very reason, and in that case, certainly,
it seemed to me that the courts had looked at a broader perspec-
tive.

  Professor Pitofsky, you mentioned Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mas-
sachusetts, which involved cost control measures in the health care
area, which is not irrelevant in terms of the current discussion and
debate now in Congress. Can you explain how the Kartell case is
an example of a Breyer opinion in favor of the defendant that in
fact protects consumers?

  Mr. PITOFSKY. Yes; it is an excellent example. What happened
there was that Blue Cross/Blue Shield essentially imposed on the
doctors in Massachusetts a rule that they accept the insurance pay-
ment as complete discharge of any moneys that were owed to the
doctors. The doctors then got together and sued, claiming that Blue
Cross/Blue Shield had set the level too low, and they were not
being reasonably compensated for their services. They wanted to
charge the patient additional money over and above the insurance
money, and they claimed that Blue Cross/Blue Shield was engaged
in a boycott.

  Technically, Judge Breyer found that Blue Cross/Blue Shield was
a single entity; it was not a conspiracy, and therefore they had the
right to bargain for the lowest price.

  As a practical matter, there is little question that the con-
sequence of the case was that Blue Cross/Blue Shield's efforts at
cost containment were sustained. And an antitrust effort to block
                                      599

that, which would have allowed the doctors to charge the patients
more money otherwise, was struck down by Judge Breyer.

  That is hardly a big business, anti-antitrust conclusion. On the
contrary, it seems to me, looking at it in a common sensical, prac-
tical way, that is a proconsumer result.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it certainly is, and that is a pretty com-
mon issue, and different States have had different laws in attempt-
ing to deal with that, and we have at the Federal level as well. It
is a very key area in terms of a public policy issue, and you have
certainly stated accurately what the conclusion was on that hold-
ing, and that is that the consumers' pocketbooks and wallets were
protected.

  We have seen in Massachusetts, Professor Sunstein in the cases
on environment, one of them obviously was the Georgia Banks
case, and that action was, I think, an enormously important envi-
ronmental action. I think the estimate in terms of what was going
to be out there was in the hundreds of thousands or millions of bar-
rels, and then the reassessment down to what would have been a
6- to 7-day consumption of the country, and what would have hap-
pened in an area of the country that provides about a quarter to
a third of all of the fish product that is actually consumed by the
United States--a very, very important area--was certainly very,
very significant and profound.

  I thank all of you for your presence here today and for your testi-
mony.

  I will put in the record the letter that was sent to Senator Biden,
which I referenced earlier. I placed it in the record, but I will just
quote here:

   In our view, Judge Breyer is a thoughtful and enlightened advocate of antitrust
enforcement. He understands and appreciates the effectiveness of a free market pro-
tected by the antitrust laws and serving the welfare of consumers. He also under-
stands the need for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to correct market
failures. We expect he will be a vigorous foe of anticompetitive behavior and a pow-
erful voice in the Supreme Court, supporting effective antitrust enforcement.

  That is certainly my conclusion, also, having worked with him
when I was chairman of the antitrust subcommittee here in the
Senate, and I think for those who have studied his work.

   So I will include the full letter in the record.
  We thank you very, very much. We appreciate it.
  Mr. PITOFSKY. Thank you.
   Mr. SUNSTEIN. Thank you.
   Senator KENNEDY. Our final panel--and here, the old saying,
"last, but not least," really does apply--the committee welcomes
the presidents of bar associations around the country. Barbara
Paul Robinson is here today on behalf of the Association of the Bar
of the City of New York; Ms. Robinson is the president of the Asso-
ciation and a partner in Debevois & Plimpton. The committee wel-
comes you, Ms. Robinson.
  Also on the panel are representatives of other nationwide bar as-
sociations. Paulette Brown is president of the National Bar Asso-
ciation and is here today on behalf of the Coalition of Bar Associa-
tions of Color. With her this afternoon are members of the coalition
representing their respective memberships.

  Brian Sun is the president of the National Asian-Pacific Amer-
ican Bar Association.

  Richard Monet is president of the Native American Bar Associa-
tion.

  And Wilfredo Caraballo is president of the Hispanic National Bar
Association.

  We welcome all of you here. I want to mention that, as the
youngest member of a large family, I was often the last one to be
heard at a large table. I think we want to thank you all very much
for your patience here. We have had a series of interruptions which
were unavoidable in the course of today's hearings. Generally, we
do not have the type of interruptions that we have had today, with
the floor activity. So you have been very patient. We are very
grateful. This is very important. I know I speak for all of my col-
leagues when I say that we will be looking forward to examining
in very careful detail your commentary.

  So I want to personally express my great appreciation for your
patience and for your willingness to be a part of this whole process.

  We will start off with Ms. Robinson.

PANEL CONSISTING OF BARBARA PAUL ROBINSON, THE ASSO-

  YORK, NY; PAULETTE BROWN, NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION,
  ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS
  OF COLOR, WASHINGTON, DC; BRIAN SUN, PRESIDENT, NA-
  TIONAL ASIAN-PACIFIC AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION; RICH-
  ARD MONET, PRESIDENT, NATIVE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIA-
  TION; AND WILFREDO CARABALLO, PRESIDENT, HISPANIC
  NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION

             STATEMENT OF BARBARA PAUL ROBINSON

  Ms. ROBINSON. Thank you, Senator. I was going to thank you for
your patience in hearing us at this late hour and to tell you again
thank you for the opportunity to testify before this distinguished
Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the context of the nomina-
tion of Judge Breyer to the Supreme Court.

  As you said, my name is Barbara Paul Robinson, and I am here
as president of The Association of the Bar of the City of New York.
We are one of the oldest bar associations in the country, and we
are about to celebrate our 125th anniversary.

  We now include over 20,000 members, and we were established
to promote reform and approve the administration of justice, par-
ticularly in the courts. We try very hard to work in the public in-
terest.

  Our executive committee, through a subcommittee chaired by
Stephen Rosenfeld, who is here with me today, has reviewed Judge
Breyer's nomination, as it has reviewed earlier candidates for ap-
pointment to the Supreme Court. After an extensive review, the as-
sociation has concluded that Judge Breyer is indeed qualified to be
a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, because he possesses to a sub-
stantial degree all of the following qualifications that are set forth
in our guidelines when we consider nominees to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
                                      601
  They are: exceptional legal ability; extensive experience and
knowledge in law; outstanding intellectual and analytical talents;
maturity of judgment; unquestionable integrity and independence;
a temperament reflecting a willingness to search for a fair resolu-
tion of each case before the Court; a sympathetic understanding of
the Court's role under the Constitution in the protection of the per-
sonal rights of individuals; an appreciation of the historic role of
the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the meaning of the U.S.
Constitution, including especially sensitivity to the respective pow-
ers and reciprocal responsibilities of the Congress and executive.
  Because these guidelines limit approval to those of high distinc-
tion, the guidelines do not provide for gradations in ratings. Quali-
fied and unqualified are the only ratings we employ.
  In reaching this conclusion, our subcommittee read extensive ma-
terials, including all of Judge Breyer's more than 500 opinions
which he has written as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit, many of his articles, lectures and books, and nu-
merous news articles and commentaries appearing with respect to
the nomination. In particular, the subcommittee focused on cases
in the areas of antitrust, which you have addressed extensively
today, but also civil rights and civil liberties, criminal law and sen-
tencing guidelines, and administrative law, particularly in the eco-
nomic and environmental regulatory field.
  The subcommittee also conducted numerous telephone interviews
with former colleagues and law clerks of Judge Breyer, and attor-
neys who had appeared before him. They received and considered
comments from our membership--which, as I said, is over 20,000--
and because of the graciousness of Judge Breyer, several members
of the subcommittee interviewed him in person.
  The executive committee also took account of the recent reports
in the press which questioned whether Judge Breyer should have
focused and recused himself in cases involving Superfund environ-
mental liability under Federal law because of his investments in
Lloyd's of London syndicates and his possible personal liability for
underwriting losses. They considered carefully the Superfund cases
in which Judge Breyer has participated since 1987, none of which
involved insurance coverage issues, as well as the available evi-
dence concerning Judge Breyer's awareness of the extent and na-
ture of possible Superfund exposure by the syndicates in which he
was a member, and his ability to evaluate the potential impact, if
any, of his decisions in Superfund cases on his own financial inter-
ests.
  Based on the applicable statutory standard for disqualification of
Federal judges--28 U.S.C. section 455--and the evidence available
prior to these hearings and during them, the executive committee
found no reason to depart from its conclusions as to Judge Breyer's
judgment, integrity, and independence by virtue of the fact that he
did not recuse himself in the Superfund cases.
  I might add in closing that because these questions of recusal
and judges' investments do pose challenging issues and do arise not
only in these hearings, but in other cases, our Association, follow-
ing on some of the comments raised by Senator Simon, intends to
study this area, and we hope to perform a public service by making
some helpful recommendations for the future.
                                             602

  Thank you very much. I would be delighted to answer any ques-
tions.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Brown.

                          PREPARED STATEMENT OF BARBARA PAUL ROBINSON

   THE ASSOCIATION OF THE BAR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK FINDS JUDGE STEPHEN G.
                    BREYER QUALIFIED TO BE A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

  The Association of the Bar of the City of New York has concluded that Judge Ste-
phen G. Breyer is qualified to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, be-
cause he possesses, to a substantial degree, all of the following qualifications enu-
merated in the Guidelines established by the Executive Committee for considering
nominees to the United States Supreme Court:

  · exceptional legal ability;
  · extensive experience and knowledge in law;
  · outstanding intellectual and analytical talents;
  · maturity ofjudgment;
  · unquestionable integrity and independence;
  · a temperament reflecting a willingness to search for a fair resolution of each

        case before the Court;
  · a sympathetic understanding of the Court's role under the Constitution in the

        protection of the personal rights of individuals;
  · an appreciation for the historic role of the Supreme Court as the final arbiter

        of the meaning of the United States Constitution, including a sensitivity to
        the respective powers and reciprocal responsibilities of the Congress and Ex-
        ecutive.
  Because the Executive Committee Guidelines limit approval to those of high dis-
tinction, the Guidelines do not provide for gradations of ratings; qualified and un-
qualified are the only ratings employed.
  In reaching this conclusion, a subcommittee of the Executive Committee read ex-
tensive materials, including all of Judge Breyer's more than 500 written opinions
as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, many of his
articles, lectures and books, and numerous news articles and commentaries appear-
ing with respect to the nomination. The subcommittee also conducted a number of
telephone interviews of former colleagues and law clerks of Judge Breyer and attor-
neys who had appeared before him, received and considered comments from the
membership of the Association, and interviewed Judge Breyer in person.
  The Executive Committee also took account of recent reports in the press which
questioned whether Judge Breyer should have recused himself in cases involving
"Superfund" environmental liability under federal law, as a consequence of his in-
vestments in Lloyd's of London syndicates and his possible personal liability for un-
derwriting losses. The Executive Committee considered carefully the "Superfund"
cases in which Judge Breyer has participated since 1987, none of which involved
insurance coverage issues, as well as the available evidence concerning Judge
Breyer's awareness of the extent and nature of possible "Superfund" exposure by the
syndicates of which he was a member, and his ability to evaluate the potential im-
pact, if any, of his decisions in "Superfund" cases on his own financial interests.
  Based on the applicable statutory standard for disqualification of federal judges
(28 U.S.C. § 455) and the evidence currently available prior to the Senate confirma-
tion process, the Executive Committee found no reason to depart from its conclu-
sions as to Judge Breyer's judgment, integrity and independence by virtue of the
fact that he did not recuse himself in the "Superfund cases.
  The Association acted on the nomination under a policy that directs the Executive
Committee to evaluate all candidates for appointment to the Supreme Court.

                 STATEMENT OF PAULETTE BROWN
  Ms. BROWN. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.
  We, too, appreciate the opportunity, as Ms. Robinson expressed,
for your patience in staying here this late on a Friday.
  Before I start, I would also like to make note of the fact and ex-
tend my appreciation on behalf of the National Bar Association for
the remarks which were made earlier this morning which are re-
                                             603

freshing, in that you keep an open mind as to the various evalua-
tions that are brought before the committee. We appreciate very
much those comments.

  I am, as was indicated before, the president of the National Bar
Association, which is the oldest and largest bar association of color,
founded in 1925. Also present, as you indicated, are Wilfredo
Caraballo, president of the Hispanic Bar Association; Brian Sun,
president of the Asian-Pacific Bar Association; and Richard Monet,
who is a representative of the Native American Bar. Johnny Bear
Cub Stiffarm is actually the president, but she could not be here
today.

  We are representing the entire membership of the Coalition of
Bar Associations of Color. By way of background, the Coalition be-
came a formal organization as of May 22, 1994. The preceding year,
the boards of governors of each organization held a summit to dis-
cuss and resolve issues of common concern. This year, when we
convened, a decision was made to formalize our association. We
have learned over the years that the issues that we face are not
necessarily unique to our individual organizations. We believe it to
be crucial to our well-being and to our constituents that on certain
issues, we must speak as one voice.

  The coalition is a unified voice for more than 50,000 attorneys of
color. We are unified and bonded together by our common experi-
ences of discrimination and denial of access. For these reasons, we
feel compelled to speak to the nomination of Judge Breyer to the
Supreme Court.

  Our primary purpose before the committee is neither to oppose
nor extol, but rather to once again apprise Judge Breyer and the
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of the growing need
for the Supreme Court to once again assume the mantle of leader-
ship as to ensuring the protection, inclusion, empowerment, and
uplifting people of color throughout our Nation.

  Although we are not here to oppose the confirmation of Judge
Breyer as the 108th Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, in truth,
the coalition would have preferred that President Clinton nominate
a jurist of color with some meaningful degree of exposure and sen-
sitivity to the issues of concern and importance to all Americans,
particularly those who are least likely to have their interests and
rights protected.

  We are not certain that the background of Judge Breyer com-
ports with these important qualities which the President has him-
self recognized as a priority in the makeup of the Court. Of the 107
Justices to serve on our Nation's highest court to date, there have
only been two persons of color--Justice Thurgood Marshall and,
now, Justice Clarence Thomas. There have been two woman--Jus-
tice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There
have been zero Hispanic Americans, zero Native Americans, and no
Asian-Pacific Americans. The two African-American Justices rep-
resent less than a paltry 2 percent of all Supreme Court Justices
throughout the years. If we count the two woman now serving as
"minorities," the combined total of four minority Justices would
represent an anemic 4 percent of the total number of those who
have served on the Nation's highest Court.
                                              604

  If you further consider that, of those named, the sensitivity to-
ward those who are most likely to be underrepresented, the per-
centages decrease even further. Hispanics, for example, and Asian-
Pacific Americans now constitute the fastest-growing segment of
our Nation's population. The inability of Presidents over the past
25 years to nominate judges of color to serve on the Supreme Court
tends to imply, whether intentionally or not, that there are no well-
qualified intellectuals of color deserving of a seat on this Court.

  This implication is untrue and must be dispelled as soon as pos-
sible. Further, while a Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, or African-American
jurist would have been an appropriate choice, we cannot ignore the
fact that Native Americans have lived in this country longer than
any other group of people, and likewise, they have, if we dare say,
been trampled upon more than other groups of people. One among
their ranks should also have been considered.

  It appears that people of color are only entitled to have one rep-
resentative on the Court at any given time. Moreover, at this time,
there is no one who clearly represents our interests.

  For the Supreme Court to remain viable, relevant, respected and
accepted, at least a few of its members must be more than intellec-
tuals isolated from the realities, experiences, and perspectives of
significant segments of American society.

  Despite our preference, the Coalition of Bar Association of Color
for the moment has moved forward to deal with the hand that we
have been dealt. There have been a number of accolades and so
forth that have been made with regard to Judge Breyer, but we be-
lieve that they are mere statements about the potential of a Justice
Breyer.

  We are hopeful that Justice Breyer*s commitment to fairness will
extend to encompass issues such as affirmative action, discrimina-
tory application of the death penalty, and other related civil rights
matters.

  We also hope that if there is a propensity for Justice Breyer to
be probusiness, that his attitude in supporting travel sovereignty
and the Native Americans in their effort to support economic devel-
opment in Indian country will be considered.

  We are also hopeful that a Justice Breyer will be forceful and in-
fluential in cases involving the Civil Rights Act which still, regret-
tably, provides an exemption to the Asian-American workers in the
Wards Cove case.

  Though our rights are under attack from more than one source,
people of color across the Nation have not yet all become pessimis-
tically cynical. In hopes of preventing such an occurrence, the Coa-
lition of Bar Associations of Color will be closely watching to see
whether Judge Breyer manifests his fullest potential for fairness
once he assumes his role as Justice Breyer, and if so, what impact
it has upon the entire Court.

  For people of color, the time for potential has passed. As has
been said, words are wonderful, but deeds are divine. The coalition
looks forward to Justice Breyer's deeds of fairness, and hopefully,
those of the entire Court.

  Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COALITION OF BAR ASSOCIATIONS OF COLOR ("CBAC")

  Good morning Chairman Biden, members of the Committee, I am Paulette Brown,
president of the National Bar Association (NBA). Also present are Wilfredo
Caraballo, president of the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA), Brian Sun,
president of the National Asian-Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA), and
Richard Monet, a representative of the Native American Bar Association (NABA),
Jonnie Bearcub Stiffarm, president of the Native American Bar Association, could
not be present today.

  This morning we are here representing not only the National Bar Association, but
the entire membership of the coalition of Bar Associations of Color; the National Bar
Association, Hispanic National Bar Association, the National Asian-Pacific Bar As-
sociation, and the Native American Bar Association.

  By way of background, the coalition became a formal organization as of May 22,
1994. The preceding year, the Boards of Governors of each organization held a sum-
mit to discuss and resolve issues of common concern. This year when we convened,
a decision was made to formalize our association. We have learned over the years
that the issues that we face are not necessarily unique to our individual organiza-
tions. We believe it to be crucial to our well being and to our constituents that on
certain issues, we speak as one voice.

  CBAC is a unified voice for more than 50,000 attorneys of color. We are unified
and bonded together by our common experiences of discrimination and denial of ac-
cess. For these reasons, we feel compelled to speak to the nomination of Judge
Breyer to the Supreme Court.

  Our primary purpose before the Committee this morning is neither to oppose nor
extol, but rather to once again apprise Judge Breyer and the members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee of the growing need for the Supreme Court to once again as-
sume the mantle of leadership as to ensuring the protection, inclusion,
empowerment and uplifting of people of color throughout our Nation.

  Although we are not here this morning to oppose the confirmation of Judge
Breyer as the 108th Justice of the United States Supreme Court, in truth, the Coali-
tion of Bar Associations of Color would have preferred that President Clinton nomi-
nate a jurist of color with some meaningful degree of exposure and sensitivity to
the issues of concern and importance to all Americans, particularly those who are
least likely of having their interests and rights protected. We are not certain that
the background of Judge Breyer comports with these important qualities which the
President has himself recognized as a priority in the makeup of the Court.

  Of the 107 Justices to serve on our Nation s highest court to date, there have been
only two (2) persons of color: Justice Thurgood Marshall and now Justice Clarence
Thomas; two (2) women: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg; zero (0) Hispanic Americans; zero (0) Native Americans; and no Asian-
Pacific Americans. The two African-American Justices represent less than a paltry
2 percent of all Supreme Court Justices throughout the years. If we count the two
(2) women now serving as "minorities," the combined total of four (4) "minority" Jus-
tices would represent an anemic 4 percent of the total number of those who have
served on the Nation's highest court. If you further consider that of those named,
the sensitivity toward those who are most likely to be underrepresented, the per-
centages decrease even further.

   Hispanics, for example, and Asian-Pacific Americans now constitute the fastest
growing segments of our Nation's population. The inability of Presidents over the
last 25 years to nominate judges of color to serve on the Supreme Court tends to
imply, whether intentionally or not, that there are no well-qualified intellectuals of
color deserving of a seat on this court. This implication is untrue and must be dis-
pelled as soon as possible. Further, while a Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, or African-
American jurist would have been an appropriate choice, we cannot ignore the fact
that Native Americans have lived in this country longer than any other group of
people and, likewise, they have, if we dare to say, been trampled upon more than
other groups of people. One among their ranks should also have been considered,
It appears that people of color are only entitled to have one representative on the
court at any given time. Moreover, at this time there is no one who clearly rep-
resents our interests.

  For the Supreme Court to remain viable, relevant, respected and accepted, at
least a few of its members must be more than intellectuals isolated from the reali-
ties, experiences and perspectives of significant segments of American society. We
wonder whether Judge Breyer, because of his gender and ethnicity is able to fully
understand this reality.

  Despite our preference, the coalition of Bar Associations of Color, for the moment,
has moved forward to deal with the hand that we have been dealt.
                                             606

  The Department of Justice has averred that Judge Breyer's "career reflects a
deep-seated commitment to fairness * * * so that all government and law may work
better for all people * * * (and) that courts and law * * * be accessible to all citi-
zens." 1

  Vernon Jordan has written: "Judge Breyer's decisions reflect his strong commit-
ment to protecting the rights of all Americans and ensuring the vindication of our
civil rights. He will be a champion of fairness and justice on the bench."2

  Robert Pitofsky, a former dean of Georgetown University asserts: "He under-
stands that Government regulation is often necessary to ensure not just efficiency
but fairness * * *"3

  All of these laudatory assertions begin heaped upon Judge Breyer, however, con-
stitute no more than mere statements about the potential of a Justice Breyer.

  As we all know, however, potential simply means that the thing has not yet mani-
fested itself, and more realistically, justices do change.

  Yet, the Coalition of Bar Associations of Color, remains hopeful that Justice
Breyer's commitment to fairness will extend to encompass issues such as affirmative
action: Discriminatory application of the death penalty; reflect a sensitivity on im-
migration issues; adequate due process protection for death penalty appeals; envi-
ronmental justice; minority and women business set-aside programs; insurance,
mortgage and commercial redlining; selective prosecution of doctors of color on Med-
icaid fraud charges and as amazing as it may seem, the Voting Rights Act, which
is being steadily undermined by the regressive trend of voting rights decisions ema-
nating from the court during the past several years.

  We have read with interest the assertions that Judge Breyer is "pro-business".
Hopefully, if such a propensity exists, Justice Breyer will extend this ^>ro-business"
attitude to supporting tribal sovereignty and Native Americans in their effort to
support economic development in Indian country. We are also hopeful that a Justice
Breyer will be forceful and influential on cases involving the Civil Rights Act, which
still regrettably provides an exemption to the Asian-American workers in the Ward's
Cove case.

  Though our rights are under attack from more than one source, people or color
across the nation have not yet all become pessimistically cynical.

  In hopes of preventing such an occurrence, the Coalition of Bar Associations of
People of Color will be closely watching to see whether Judge Breyer manifests his
fullest potential for fairness once he assumes his role as Justice Breyer and if so,
what impact it has on the entire Court.

  For people of color, the time for potential has passed. As it has been said, words
are wonderful. But deeds are divine.

  The Coalition of National Bar Associations of Color looks forward to Justice
Breyer's deeds of fairness and, hopefully, those of the entire Court during the 1995
term and beyond.

       Thank you.

                      STATEMENT OF BRIAN SUN
  Mr. SUN. Thank you, Senator Kennedy, for allowing me to speak
on behalf of my organization here today on Judge Breyer's nomina-
tion. NAPABA, as my organization is known, was formed basically
for the same reasons that the NBA, the HNBA and NABA were
formed, as a response to a historical pattern, a long historical pat-
tern of discrimination, denial of access to political and social insti-

  1 Judge Stephen Breyer, nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, at 1 (1994) (alteration in origi-
nal) (emphasis added) (Publication of the U.S. Department of Justice).

tutions, as a reaction to hate crimes that were racially motivated
and, in general, a response to prejudice and injustice.

  The historical events that affect Asian-Pacific Americans. are
well-known even in our current history books. I don't think I need
to go into detail in terms of recalling the anti-Chinese immigrant
exclusion laws of the 1920's, the Supreme Court's decision in the
Koramatsu case which all of us in law school read about in con-
stitutional law that justified the relocation camps, and the hate
crime murders that have directly led to the formation of my bar or-
ganization in the 1980's of Asian-Pacific Americans.

  NAPABA comes here today, Senator, with the other members of
the CBAC coalition to speak out on Judge Breyer's nomination,
which I believe you yesterday indicated, I think, at the end of yes-
terday's testimony is one of the most important things this body,
the Senate, and, in particular, this committee, can perform among
its many important legislative functions, to review, assess, evalu-
ate, and approve nominees to the Supreme Court.

  I also join with Senator Biden in his comments yesterday that
these hearings give us an opportunity, perhaps our only oppor-
tunity, as he said, to get a glimpse at what potential and what
background and history a nominee brings to the Supreme Court.

  In the written testimony that CBAC has submitted to you, Sen-
ator, we represent over 50,000 attorneys of color in this country,
and I don't know all the statistics, but I believe we can agree that
there are probably in excess of 60 million Americans of color who
are affected by the judicial process, and for these reasons we feel
that we have to speak out forcefully and vocally on the issues sur-
rounding Judge Breyer's nomination.

  The two issues I wish to speak about briefly here this afternoon,
Senator, are issues that cannot be overlooked, and to some extent
I believe have not been addressed that closely in these hearings,
and that is the issue of diversity on the U.S. Supreme Court, the
balance that Senator Specter talked about this morning, and, sec-
ond, the need for a jurist on the Supreme Court who can stand in
the tradition of Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan and
Harry Blackmun on issues defending the individual liberties and
the civil rights of all people in this country and, most importantly,
the people of color who have experienced historical discrimination.

  With respect to these two issues, NAPABA does not take the
view that Judge Breyer is not a qualified jurist. He, in fact, does
come to this hearing and these set of hearings with a strong back-
ground. His record on civil rights is one that we have found encour-
aging. However, on the issue of diversity, it is obvious that that
issue is significant to the members of CBAC and to NAPABA, in
particular, because it sends a message to persons of color that once
again we have been denied an opportunity to have a voice through
a person of color on the Supreme Court.

  Diversity is something that can be broken up in this context into
both the symbolic significance of diversity as well as the sub-
stantive significance--symbolic because persons of color in this
country have long felt, even to this day, that they have been denied
equal access to the courts. In fact, even the American Bar Associa-
tion recently, through commissions that have studied the equal ac-
cess to courts for minorities and women and the disadvantaged,
                                      608

has concluded that diversity amongst the Federal and State bench-
es and the U.S. Supreme Court is necessary to help dispel the sym-
bolic perception that persons of color have about the lack of equal
access to justice that they have in the courts.

  Just to end on that particular issue, Senator, it cannot escape us
all the recent media attention that has been given in the last dec-
ade or so to whether or not minorities or persons of color could get
a fair trial in this country. Unfortunately, it has been the focus of
perhaps some cases in the media that bring this out.

  But in any event, I think it is pretty clear that persons of color
wonder whether the system can be fair to African Americans or
other persons of color who are accused of crimes that get the kind
of publicity of the Rodney King, the O.J. Simpson case, and to some
extent the Vincent Chin case in Michigan.

  With respect to the substantive issues that are raised by Judge
Breyer's nomination--that is to say whether or not he possesses
the qualities and the background that would lead him to be com-
mitted toward protecting the civil rights of all American citizens--
let me say that we are looking for jurists, again, in the tradition
of Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan.

  Already, from a historical development standpoint, we have had
some judges in the Federal district and circuit courts who have
been appointed who are persons of color whose contribution has
been not just symbolic from the diversity standpoint, but from the
fact that they have made meaningful contributions to the develop-
ment of the law, such as Judge Higginbotham out of the Third Cir-
cuit, Judge Tang out of the Ninth Circuit, and many, many others.

  I think that we need to just keep in mind when we focus on these
issues of diversity that the President has made a commitment that
he wants a Supreme Court that is representative of the diversity
of America, and we are hopeful, and believe, that Judge Breyer, at
least as to this second issue relating to the protection of civil
rights, will stand committed, in the tradition of Justice Marshall
and Justice Brennan, to stand up and--the words I often like to
say are stand up to the plate and boldly deal with the issues that
come up in the civil rights context. We are encouraged by the fact
that Vernon Jordan, Duval Patrick, and others have supported this
nomination.

  In conclusion, Senator, NAPABA believes this issue is important
and Supreme Court nominations are important because of our his-
torical setbacks we have suffered in the Supreme Court, and you
more than any Senator, I believe, on this committee are aware of
our experiences in the Ward's Cove case, which led, in part, to the
Civil Rights Act of 1991 that you were also a big part of, and also
to the problem of the special exemption that was created in that
case that deprived the Asian workers in Ward's Cove of the rights
and benefits of the Civil Rights Act. We appreciate you and many
Senators of this committee cosponsoring legislation that would set
aside that special interest exemption that we found to be shameless
and totally inappropriate. We applaud that, but the fact that the
Ward's Cove case had to cause us to go to the Congress and seek
civil rights legislation, we believe, highlights the need for strong
Supreme Court Justices who can address these issues.
                                      609

  Finally, I would like to say something personally, Senator, and
that is this. I look forward to a day when my organization and the
members of the CBAC coalition don't have to come before this tri-
bunal or this committee and say to this committee, we need more
diversity on the Supreme Court. I look forward to a day when there
will be an Asian-Pacific American on the Supreme Court.

  I look forward to the fact and hope that my sons don't have to
come back here 10, 20, 30 years from now and sit here and make
the same statements that I have had to make here today. I do look
forward to that day, and until then I think we have to focus again
on Judge Breyer's nomination in terms of the impact it has on the
persons of color around the country.

  I want to thank you and the chairman, and particularly the staff,
for allowing us to be heard this afternoon.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Monet.

                  STATEMENT OF RICHARD MONET
  Mr. MONET. Good afternoon, Senator. On behalf of the Native
American Bar Association, I also thank you for the opportunity to
present our views on this matter today.
  The Native American Bar generally agrees with the sentiments
shared by this coalition. Like other racial minorities in our society,
Native American people daily confront the effects of racial preju-
dice and discrimination. However, the Native American Bar has
certain concerns that are somewhat distinct from those affecting
the other groups in this coalition, and I would like to share just one
of those with you today.
  As you know, Native Americans not only constitute a distinct
race in American society, but as members of tribes they also con-
stitute distinct political entities recognized as such by the United
States. Some of our most pressing issues and concerns arise in that
capacity. Unfortunately, we know very little of Judge Breyer's sen-
timents on these matters.
  As you also know, the relationship between tribes and the United
States flows from solemn treaties made early in the Nation's his-
tory. Remarking upon one of those Indian treaties, Justice Hugo
Black once wrote, "Great Nations, like great men, should keep their
word."
  In an early interpretation of another one of those treaties, Jus-
tice McKenna penned a sentence of perhaps singular clarity and
importance to tribes and the development of Federal law dealing
with tribes. He wrote, Treaties are to be construed as a grant of
rights from the Indians, not to them, and a reservation of those not
granted."
  We ask the committee and the nominee to note how Justice
McKenna's wording and logic reflect the words and logic of the
10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that what is not granted
to the Union is reserved to the States or to the people. In other
words, like the States and their people, the tribes and their people
are the source of their respective tribes' sovereignty; that whatever
sovereignty may have transferred in those treaties came from the
tribes, so that the tribes were the grantors and thus the reservers
of sovereignty. In other words, treaties with tribes, like the 10th
                                      610

amendment, invoke this Nation's highest principles and logic of
Federal republican democracy.

  Nevertheless, in recent years the Supreme Court has begun a
significant departure from those principles, at least when they are
applied to tribes. For example, about 6 years ago in the Cabazon
decision, the dissenting opinion argued that the tribes did not pos-
sess certain regulatory jurisdiction unless it was first granted to
them by the Congress or the States, an argument in direct con-
travention to the logic of the McKenna quote. Fortunately for the
tribes, the majority in Cabazon was compelled to respond to the
dissent by saying, and I quote, "That is simply not the law."

  Unfortunately, due to changes on the Court, the Cabazon dissent
has since garnered a majority on the Court, and the logic of our
treaties is being subverted in a way that simply cannot be rec-
onciled with this Nation's first principles. As a result, the tribes
and their people have suffered.

  In conclusion, I would like to say make note that every term the
Supreme Court deals with numerous cases affecting all the tribes,
and it is a little-known fact that at times the Supreme Court hears
more Indian law cases than any other kind of case. We believe, be-
cause of that reason, that it is imperative that nominees to the Su-
preme Court express their views on these matters and bear an un-
derstanding of how this field of law comports with our constitu-
tional jurisprudence, in the hopes that the future jurisprudence of
nominees, such as Judge Breyer, on matters affecting tribes will
comport with those principles that America stands for.

  Thank you very much.
  [The prepared statement of Mr. Monet follows:]

            PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, on behalf of the Native American
Bar Association, I thank you for the opportunity to present our views on the nomi-
nation of Judge Stephen Breyer for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

  Mr. Chairman, the Native American Bar Association agrees with the statement
offered by the Coalition. Like other racial minorities in our society, Indian people
daily confront the effects of racial prejudice and discrimination. Nowhere has the
cycle been more difficult to break than in the staid field of the law. However, the
Native American Bar Association has certain concerns that are somewhat distinct
of those affecting other groups in the coalition.

  As you all know, Indian people not only constitute a distinct race in American so-
ciety, but as members of Tribes many Indian people also constitute distinct political
entities recognized as such by the United States. Some of our most pressing issues
and concerns arise in that capacity.

  The relationship between Tribes and the United Statesflowsfrom solemn treaties
made early in this Nation's history. Remarking upon one of those Indian treaties
Justice Black wrote: "Great Nations, like great men, keep their word." In an early
interpretation of another one of those treaties Justice McKenna penned a sentence
of perhaps singular importance to Tribes and the development of federal law dealing
with Tribes. He wrote, "Treaties are to be construed as a grant of rights from the
Indians, not to them--and a reservation of those not granted."

  We ask the committee and the nominee to note how Justice McKenna's wording
and logic reflect the words and logic of the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion: that what is not granted to the Union in the Constitution is reserved to the
States or to the people. In other words like the States and their people, Tribes and
their people are the source of the respective Tribes' sovereignty, that whatever sov-
ereignty may have transferred in those treaties came from the Tribes, so that the
Tribes were the grantors and thus the reservers of sovereignty. Treaties with
Tribes, like the Tenth Amendment, invoke this Nation's highest principles and logic
of federal republican democracy.
                                      611

  In recent years the Supreme Court has begun a significant departure from those
principles, at least when they are applied to Tribes. For example, about six years
ago, in the Cabazon decision, the dissenting opinion argued that the Tribes did not
possess certain regulatory jurisdiction unless it was first granted to them by Con-
gress or the States, an argument in direct contravention to the logic of the McKenna
quote. Fortunately for the Tribes, the majority in Cabazon was compelled to respond
to the dissent by saying, and I quote, "That is simply not the law."

  Unfortunately, due to changes on the Court, the Cabazon dissent has since gar-
nered a majority on the Court, and the logic of our treaties has been subverted in
a way that cannot be reconciled with this Nation's principles of federal republican
democracy. As a result, the Tribes and their people have suffered. We are reminded
of what American philosopher Felix Cohen once wrote: "Like the miner's canary, the
Indian marks the shift from fresh air to poison gas in our political atmosphere; and
our treatment of Indians, even more than our treatment of other minorities, reflects
the rise and fall in our democratic faith."

  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, every term the Supreme Court deals with numerous
cases affecting all Tribes, at times hearing more Indian law cases than any other
kind. We believe it is imperative that nominees express their views on these matters
and bear an understanding of how this field of the law comports with our constitu-
tional jurisprudence. The Native American Bar Association requests the Committee
to solicit the nominee's views and to insist upon answers that comport with the
principles for which America stands.

  Thank you for the opportunity to share our views.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Wilfredo Caraballo.

              STATEMENT OF WILFREDO CARABALLO
  Mr. CARABALLO. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. The His-
panic National Bar Association appreciates the longstanding rela-
tionship that our organization has had with many of the members
of this committee and with a lot of its staff. We hope to continue
that relationship into the future.
  In particular, I would like to publicly thank two members of this
committee who have gone out of their way in the past to make
statements publicly concerning the need for an Hispanic on the Su-
preme Court, and those are Senators Biden and Senator Hatch. On
behalf of our organization, we would like to thank both of them.
  I know that there might not be many Senators here, and I notice,
however, that there are staff. I hope that when the testimony is
looked at, one fact comes out. We have come together as four orga-
nizations in an unprecedented way. We want the members of this
committee, and we would like the administration and this Nation
to understand and listen to the words that we have used.
  We have not called ourselves minority bars. We don't consider
ourselves minorities. We are people of color representing over 60
million people in this country, and in the very near future we are
going to be the majority in this country and we ask that as you lis-
ten to our pleas, you understand that part of that plea is for the
generations to come. We are asking that we be treated today the
way we hope you will want our children and our grandchildren to
treat your children and your grandchildren.
  When Justice Blackmun announced his resignation, the Hispanic
National Bar Association received many calls from Hispanics
around the country. It was universally believed by the members of
our organization and others that the 108th Justice to the Supreme
Court of the United States was going to be an Hispanic. We be-
lieved the promise that the face of justice was finally going to in-
clude ours.
                                      612
  We believed this not because there exists some numerical imper-
ative for sitting on the Supreme Court, but because there exists a
moral imperative that all who are among the judged have the right
to expect that they may be represented in the faces of those who
judge. The members of the Hispanic National Bar Association be-
lieved that I would be sitting here today testifying about the quali-
fications of an Hispanic nominee, a prospect which was personally
awe-inspiring.
  We relate this to you so that you may sense the difficulty our or-
ganization has had in coming to grips with this latest disappoint-
ment. Nevertheless, as lawyers, we believe that we cannot abdicate
our responsibility to consider and evaluate the credentials of the
person who was ultimately nominated. As lawyers from the His-
panic community, we must represent our community before you. As
Americans, we owe the Nation the benefits of our thoughts.
  In fairness to a nominee who is not responsible for our dis-
appointment and who has worked hard to earn the nomination in
his own right, we come before this committee prepared to testify
on the nomination of Judge Stephen Breyer.
  Having worked with him, many on this committee know better
than most about the intellect and compassion that Judge Breyer
takes to the Supreme Court. His achievements thus far are truly
remarkable. Our organization has looked hard at his ample record.
We have discovered in his work a judge who is forthright and who
accomplishes something in his opinions which very few judges even
try. He is readable. People can actually understand what he writes.
  As you know, Judge Breyer is the chief judge of the circuit which
encompasses the Federal courts of Puerto Rico. As such, many of
our members from Puerto Rico have appeared before him. Our
members in Puerto Rico speak very highly of Judge Breyer, as do
many of our members in Massachusetts. Many of them have indi-
cated their belief that he is someone who understands the need to
make justice a reality for all Americans.
  The presidents of the Puerto Rico region of the Hispanic National
Bar Association and the Puerto Rico Federal Bar Association are
effusive in communicating their colleagues' opinion regarding
Judge Breyer's intellect and his appreciation of the fact that the
justice system was created to be just. Our evaluation of Judge
Breyer's credentials, coupled with firsthand knowledge on the part
of many of our members, convinces us that Judge Breyer will make
an excellent addition to the Supreme Court. We hope that the
words of our members in Puerto Rico will be echoed by our mem-
bers throughout the country in the years to come.
  We further hope that our high regard for our duty is not mis-
understood. As we praise the obvious credentials of Judge Breyer,
we remind the Nation of the need to have the face of justice reflect
all of the people in this country. We should never ration justice or
judicial positions. This would demean the importance of selecting
the best and the brightest, but it is important to remember that
the best and the brightest come from all races and ethnic groups.
It is time for the Nation to see an Hispanic as among the best and
the brightest on the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Thank you.

            PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION

  Good morning. The Hispanic National Bar Association is appreciative of the long-
standing relationship that our organization has had with many of the members of
this committee and its staff. In particular, we would like to thank the chair, Senator
Biden, and Senator Hatch, for their public statements in support of a Hispanic for
the Supreme Court.

  When Justice Blackmun announced his resignation, I received many calls for His-
panics around the country. It was universally believed by the members of our orga-
nization that the 108th Justice of the United States Supreme Court was surely
going to be a Hispanic. We believed the promise that the face of justice would in-
clude ours. Not because there exists some numerical imperative for sitting on the
Supreme Court, but because there exists a moral imperative that all who are judged
have the right to be judges themselves.

g I was personally awed by the possibility that I would be the president of the His-
 anic National Bar Association when the first Hispanic was named to the Supreme
  ourt.
  I truly believed that I would be sitting here speaking about the qualifications of
a Hispanic nominee.

  I relate this to you so that you may sense the difficulty our organization has had
in coming to grips with this latest disappointment.

  Nevertheless, as lawyers we believe that we cannot abdicate our responsibility to
consider and evaluate the credentials of the person who is actually nominated.

  We have set our subjective feelings aside so that we may fairly consider the cre-
dentials of Judge Stephen G. Breyer.

  As the lawyers from the Hispanic community we must represent our community
before you; as Americans we owe the Nation the benefit of our thoughts. In fairness
to a nominee who is not responsible for our disappointment, and who has worked
hard to earn this nomination in his own right, we come before this committee fully
prepared to support the nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer.

  Many on this committee know better than most about the intellect and the com-
passion that Judge Breyer takes to the Supreme Court. His achievements thus far
are truly remarkable.

  Our organization has looked at his ample record. We have discovered, in his work,
a judge who is forthright and who accomplishes something in his opinions which
very few judges even try: his is readable. He is understood.

  As you know, Judge Breyer is the Chief Judge of the circuit which encompasses
the Federal Courts of Puerto Rico. As such, many of our members form Puerto Rico
have appeared before him. Our member there speak very highly of Judge Breyer
as do some of our members from Massachusetts. Many have indicated their belief
that he is someone who understands the need to make justice a reality for all Amer-
icans. The presidents of the Puerto Rico Region of the Hispanic National Bar Asso-
ciation and the Puerto Rico Federal Bar are effusive in communicating their col-
leagues' opinion regarding Judge Breyer's intellect and his capacity to understand
the nature of our legal system and the reasons for which it was set up as it is. they
have observed that he has been very deferential to the decisions of the Puerto Rico
courts.

  It is this first hand knowledge on the part of many of our members coupled with
his record, that makes us believe that Judge Breyer will make an excellent addition
to the Supreme Court.

  It is our hope that the words of our members in Puerto Rico will be echoed by
our members throughout the country in the years to come.

  It is our further hope that our high regard for our duty is not misunderstood. As
we praise the obvious credentials of Judge Breyer, we remind the Nation of the need
to have the face of justice be reflective of all of the people of this country.

  We should never ration justice or judicial positions; thus demeaning the impor-
tance of selecting the best and the brightest to serve, but, it is important to remem-
ber that the best and the brightest come from all races and ethnic groups. It is time
for the Nation to see a Hispanic as among the best and the brightest.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, thank you very much, all of you, for
being here and for your testimony. Let me just ask very, very brief-
ly a couple of questions--basically, really, one.

  Richard Monet, how many Native American graduates do you
have from law schools this year?

  Mr. MONET. I teach at the University of Wisconsin Law School,
and every year I would say anywhere from 60 to 70 students start
                                      614
law school in the past maybe 10 years. I would say every year
maybe 30 or so make it out.

  Senator KENNEDY. AS I remember, I was chairman, and my
brother, Bob, was, of the Indian education committee, and then
when I was chairman of the Administrative Practices Subcommit-
tee we got into a lot of issues affecting Indian water rights and
other issues, and the basic conflict which exists in the Department
of the Interior between the various bureaus--the water rights of
Indians versus the other kinds of rights that exist over there, and
who is really going to be pursuing them. Does the U.S. attorney
protect the Indian water rights or the commercial rights? So there
is an enormous amount of very important questions on mineral
rights and water rights that I know you are very familiar with.

  I believe during the period of the 1960's and early 1970's, the
number was down to 10 or 12 a year, so it is important to under-
stand that issue, and we are always interested if you have sugges-
tions or ideas. I am chairman of the committee with jurisdiction on
education here, and although a lot of the Indian education is over
in Interior, a lot of the higher education is in our committee and
we would always welcome ideas that you might have on what we
could do.

  Mr. MONET. Thank you very much.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Sun, I want to let you know that one of
the first pieces of legislation that I was able to get passed into law
was the elimination of the Asian-Pacific triangle that was part of
the Immigration Act, going back to the McCarran-Walter Immigra-
tion Act that we changed in 1965. At that time, I think it was lim-
ited to about 125 Asian immigrants coming into the United States,
and that obviously has dramatically changed and shifted. When
you were talking about that issue, it brought back the important
legacy of discrimination against Asians, and you have outlined
that.
  I want you to know, on Ward's Cove, I am right with you. We
have been talking with Patty Murray, and Norm Mineta, I know,
from the House has been working on it, and we want you to know
that this is something that is very much on our minds and we are
going to do what we can to try and see a reversal of that current
injustice. So I want to just reiterate that. We haven't been able to
do what we should on that case, but it isn't because we are still
not interested and committed and concerned about it, and we want
you to work with us, and I know you will, and with other members
of this committee and of the Senate on the issue.
  Mr. SUN. I appreciate that very much, Senator. NAPABA appre-
ciates you and Senator Murray cosponsoring the legislation seeking
to set aside that exemption, and Representative McDermott from
the House side as well.
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes. In the Supreme Court holding, my posi-
tion was retroactivity, and then I thought once we got the retro-
activity there could be no denial in terms of justice of including
Ward's Cove. As you are aware, the courts did not come out in that
particular way when they interpreted it, although I think, if you
look historically at the Civil Rights Act, it is probably pretty mixed
in terms of applying the Civil Rights Act retroactively or prospec-
tively. But nonetheless, we have been working with some of those
                                      615
in the community who have been most concerned, and we will con-
tinue to do so. I want to give you those assurances.

  Mr. SUN. Thank you.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just ask you this, just finally, and each of
you might comment. Senator Kerry and I had the opportunity of
making suggestions to the President in filling Federal District
Court vacancies, and we were able to get important diversity on
that court, and we have continued to do so over the period of the
last several months. But let me ask you what you would welcome,
either procedurally or nonprocedurally, as far as ways that we
could get more qualified and well-qualified to the attention of
decisionmakers.
  We saw over a long period of time that most of the individuals,
both on gender and color, were not until fairly recently in major
law firms, and that many of them had come up from legal services
programs, working out in the counties as public defenders or pros-
ecutors, and then in small firms.
  So there is a whole range built into the process and the system
where those who evaluate individuals who might be considered for
courts--Federal, circuit, as well as Supreme Court--have these in-
herent biases. It is still out there. And it exists in gender as well.
I know, being married to a professional lawyer; she talks about the
fact that if a woman partner goes to a Little League game, the
other partners will feel that she is not serious about the law; yet
if the father goes, they say, "Isn't he a wonderful father."
  So there is a whole series--I think many of you could talk about
this--the nuances that are out there, all across the framework of
the process. It is out there, and we have to be sensitive to these
issues.
  But can you tell us a little bit of what you would like to see fol-
low the next time we have a vacancy; what would you suggest to
this President, or to the Attorney General, or to the selection com-
mittee, or whatever way they are going to proceed--what kinds of
things do you really wish they would do if you had that opportunity
now?
  Let us start with Paulette. Ms. Brown.
  Ms. BROWN. Thank you, Senator.
  It sounds to me like it is a two-part question, and if I could, I
would like to answer it as I see it, in two parts. One is that you
talked about the selection process, and then it seemed that you
talked about the confirmation process.
  In the first instance, the judges from the district court generally,
in my understanding, come upon recommendation from their Sen-
ators. In that regard, I think that it is necessary for the respective
State Senators--I know that we have affiliates in almost every
State in the United States, and most of them keep at the ready
names of qualified individuals who can serve on the district court
level.
  Also, in our national office, we are a little better situated than
some of my other colleagues, just because we are older. And we do
have a staff, which means that we have a bank which can provide
names of individuals and their qualifications and backgrounds. We
also have a judicial selection committee within our organization to
assist in this process.
                                      616
  With regard to the next phase, once someone is recommended,
you may recall that during the Carter administration, the National
Bar Association had the opportunity, just as the American Bar As-
sociation, to evaluate candidates for the Bench on every level, not
just the district court level. We have not been given that privilege
since then.
  We believe that it is necessary for this committee to have a dif-
ferent perspective other than the perspective of the American Bar
Association. It is not to suggest that the American Bar Association
does not do a credible job, but I do think that they are limited in
their scope and what they think are the most important issues.
  One example which was given today--and although we were not
asked, we took it upon ourselves to conduct our own investigation
and evaluation of a recent nominee, and it was extremely thorough.
We had interviewed as many individuals on the qualifications of,
in this case, Mr. Williams, as did the American Bar Association.
We had his writings evaluated by respected scholars, and I would
dare say that the evaluation that we conducted was as extensive
and as thorough as anyone could ever hope to expect.
  So I think that in this process, if the Senate, if they are going
to consider the evaluation that the American Bar Association per-
forms, that they should also consider that of the National Bar As-
sociation or of the coalition.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Sun.
  Mr. SUN. Yes, Senator. I sort of interpret your question in terms
of breaking it up into the various levels--district court, circuit, and
Supreme Court.
  With respect to the district courts, in working with the Senators,
groups such as ours and others work with the Senators on two as-
pects. One is in fact, the search committees that a particular Sen-
ator might form to look for qualified candidates. We look to make
sure, or try to ensure, that those committees have a diversity of
representation. That is a starting point that I think has a meaning-
ful impact in the end on who gets recommended to the Senator by
the search committee, because I think, although different Senators
have different ways of going about doing it, essentially, they look
to recommendations made by qualified people they trust. And it is
incumbent on community groups and bar organizations such as
ours, it seems to me, to feed the qualified names, and in fact, even
affirmatively go out and solicit people who we think are qualified
to try to get them interested. Sometimes, some of the most quali-
fied people are people who are financially well-off and may not
want to go back to public service, since we have to sometimes cajole
them. So we do that.
  With respect to the circuit level, it is done a little bit more here
in Washington, we find. So we feel that we need to increase our
communications, and I think, echoing what Paulette said, we need
to communicate more with the members of this committee because
the political reality as we all see it is when an important position
comes open, be it in the circuit or the Supreme Court, this commit-
tee is consulted by the executive branch, for the obvious reasons
that we all know. For that reason, we feel, again, that the lines of
communication have to be improved, and we need to feed you the
names because, as Senator Biden indicated here this morning,
                                      617
there is a difference now in 1994 from 1977 when President Carter
was President. The so-called pool of qualified persons of color and
women is much greater in terms of those who are qualified for cir-
cuit positions and, indeed, for the Supreme Court, and we now
have the opportunity to provide those names and to urge the mem-
bers of this committee when they communicate with the executive
branch, to add your voice to the names that are submitted by our
various bar organizations.

  So I see us working in that vein as a means of improving the
process.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  Mr. Monet.
  Mr. MONET. Senator, when the process turns political, as you
know, Native Americans, because of their population, stand very
little chance of having a lot of leeway at any level in the game. But
if the objective is, as one of the panelists said, to have the judged
have a decision and a voice in who will be doing the judging, again
I would turn to our Native Americans' tribal side of these issues.
Quite simply, if this committee--I think it would be in its jurisdic-
tion--if this committee could force States and the Federal courts to
pay full faith and credit to tribal courts and to the decisions issued
by tribes and their judges, most of the American Indians would be
involved at that local level in their tribal governments and dealing
with their tribal courts, and I feel like they would then feel they
have participated in the process somewhat.
  If I might also, just on another point, you know, 20 years ago,
you could count on one hand all of the American Indian attorneys
in the country. Today, there are perhaps about 500. Many of the
courts are staffed by attorneys, and attorneys work in the tribes'
courts. If that otherwise unconventional and nontraditional cri-
terion were counted by this committee and by the President and by
other people as real qualifications for judging in the Federal courts,
I think we would see more qualified people.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  Mr. Caraballo.
  Mr. CAEABALLO. Senator, the Hispanic National Bar Association
has a pretty sophisticated process. We are actually getting to the
point where we are starting to feel comfortable with the district
court and court of appeals nominations, because we have developed
relationships with the Senators in those States where our people
are in large numbers. And that is really what it comes down to is
developing relationships with the individual Senators so that the
nominations can come out from them to the President. And we feel
that we are starting to make some progress in most areas.
  There are some areas where we have great relationships with the
Senator; in other areas we do not, and we are trying to develop
them. Our frustration is really more along the lines of the Supreme
Court because, truthfully, we do not know what else we can do. We
have actually done what we thought was the right thing to do,
which is we convened a nationwide committee of Hispanics from
across the country representing every Hispanic constituency we
could think of. We came up with a list. We gave that list to this
committee, which actually received it very well. We gave it to the
administration, which we believe received it very well.
                                      618
  So we have done what we think is our part, which is to bring
before you, bring before the administration, individuals whom we
think are qualified.
  We do not know what that next step is that we need to do to get
somebody on, but we are trying.
  Senator KENNEDY. OK
  Ms. ROBINSON. Senator, may I just add that I do think that our
association is eager to encourage judicial service of qualified people,
particularly minorities and women, and feel we have an edu-
cational outreach function to actually have programs at our asso-
ciation in New York to invite people who might be intimidated by
the process, to encourage them, to educate them, as to the possibili-
ties both on the Federal level, but it is also important on the State
and local levels.
  So I think all the organized bars can do more to help not only
their members, but those people who are not members, to try.
  Senator KENNEDY. I am going to ask the Attorney General to
meet with all of you and try to work out some processes and proce-
dures so at least we can get it to that level, and you can hear some
of the suggestions and think a little bit about it. I think the com-
ments have been very constructive, but I think it is important that
the Attorney General, in a way that just does not go out at the
time when you have these vacancies, but has a built-in, continuing
and working kind of relationship and understanding. I think that
is the only way that any of these suggestions will work. I will fol-
low up with her and with you and see if there are some additional
ways that we can establish better kinds of both input and commu-
nication. I think it is very important, and I am convinced that the
President feels very strongly about it. I have talked with him about
it, and I know he does, and I know that Attorney General Reno
does as well. It is very legitimate. I have spoken with them about
this question. And President Carter had a very good record on it.
We went through the period of the 1980's, and I think you are fa-
miliar with the statistics, and I am not interested at this time in
going all the way back through that. But I think if we look at the
record on this--and as you pointed out, the pool now is so much
greater than it was a number of years ago--there is a very, very
important responsibility that all of the faces at Justice, not only at
the Department, but every aspect of the judicial system be respon-
sive to the kinds of excellence that exist out there in our diversity.
We all need to think about that more carefully.
  I thank all of you very much for being here. I appreciate your
patience with us. We will follow up with you and find out what ad-
ditional suggestions you might have.
  We will include in the record at this point a statement submitted
by Nicholas Katzenbach.
  [The prepared statement of Mr. Katzenbach follows:]

                       PREPARED STATEMENT OF NICHOLAS DEB. KATZENBACH

  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: My name is Nicholas Katzenbach
and I presently practice law in New Jersey. From 1961 to 1966 I served in the De-
partment of Justice in various capacities including Attorney General. It was in this
capacity that I first had the privilege of knowing Judge Stephen Breyer. I am de-
lighted to testify in support of his nomination as a Justice of the Supreme Court.
                                         619

  Judge Breyer had been an outstanding student at Harvard Law School with a
particular interest in competition law and its economics. In 1965 I had persuaded
one of his professors at Harvard, Donald Turner, to head the Antitrust Division.
Don, in turn, was able to persuade a young Steve Breyer to join the Division at the
conclusion of his clerkship with Justice Goldberg. It was then, as you know, that
he brought even the Antitrust Division into the struggle for civil rights with his
imaginative use of competition law to compel the showing of homes in white neigh-
borhoods to African-American buyers. That position, which he both developed and
successfully defended, is illustrative, I believe, of his ability as even a young lawyer
to use scholarship in the service of human values--a capacity that has served him
well throughout his career.

  The Committee is aware of Judge Breyer*s very distinguished record as a lawyer,
law professor, Counsel to this Committee, and judge. There is no question as to his
intellectual and experiential qualifications to be a Justice. What I would like to do
very briefly is to relate that experience and his personal qualities to the job of a
Justice.

  I think in recent years there has been a change in the way both Presidents and
the Senate have looked at judicial appointments, and particularly those to the Su-
preme Court. The focus has been, in my opinion, too much on efforts to predict how
a putative Justice will vote on the immediate political issues and too little on how
he will perform over many years as a Member of our unique and important third
branch of government. Assuming a nominee has the requisite intelligence and integ-
rity what else should the President and the Senate look for?

  First, I think it is useful to weigh the candidate's experience against the job. The
Court in our political system is a political entity with a political role--note a par-
tisan one but undeniably a political one, albeit a limited one. It is obviously useful
if the nominee can bring from personal experience an understanding of government
and the proper roles of the branches of the federal government as well as that of
the States to the Court. Few candidates can bring, as Judge Breyer does, valuable
experience in all three branches and the mature understanding of roles which he
has demonstrated in all his governmental capacities.

   Second, Justices must be particularly sensitive to the long view of law and rel-
atively immune, as the President and the Congress cannot be, to the passions of the
moment. It is, after all, very often the Constitution which they are expounding. I
may be prejudiced but I think one value of teaching is that it encourages--almost
compels--a broad understanding of trends in our changing society relevant to the
long view the Court must take when interpreting the Constitution.

   Finally--and most important of all although too rarely discussed--is judicial tem-
perament. The Supreme Court is composed of nine Members with varying back-
grounds and experience. It is a collegia! institution which operates best when it
makes its decisions in a spirit of mutual respect. It is not a question of counting
votes for particular positions. It is most effective when each Member is prepared to
listen to and be persuaded by the views of colleagues. In this manner both the views
of a majority and dissenters are developed and shaped. Much more than the particu-
lar result is at stake.

  Judge Breyer is often described in terms of his pragmatism and practicality. I
think he is a man of principle with deeply held values--but one who is not so sure
he is right than he has no need to listen to the differing views of others. He is an
able advocate. But, in my opinion more importantly, he is a good listener, respectful
of the views of others and always prepared to reconsider his own. Perhaps that is
pragmatic and practical. I think it shows the temperament of a wise and intelligent
judge.

   If confirmed, Judge Breyer will undoubtedly prove to be an excellent Justice. I be-
lieve that he has the intelligence, experience and temperament to be one of the
great ones.

                                               THE SUPREME COURT

                                              CharlejB E. Huallsr

            President Clinton haa bean aisled, in my opinion, into
   making a grave mistake in nominating to the Supreme Court Judge
   Stephen Breyer of the U.8. Court of Appeals in Boston. On the
   basis of his antitrust record, he is an unjust man* He is also
   one vho is intellectually and politically committed to a set
   of "economic" theories that are demonstrably false and that
   will callouBly reduce the standard of living of the average
   American family in the decades to come.

             In response to a question from Senator Hetzenbaum in these
   hearings on July 12, Breyer replied: "Sometimes plaintiffs
   did win in antitrust cases I've had and, as you point out,
   defendants have often won. The plaintiff sometimes is a big
   business and sometimes isn't. The defendant sometimes is and
    sometimes isn't."

             Once more Breyer eeena to have trouble with the facts.
   No plaintiff, so far as I can determine, has ever won an anti-
    trust case in his court* In the attached table, I've listed
    the 19 such cases he's participated in since he joined the
    court (1980) and none was deoided for the plaintiff, (Two
    were remanded--one as a "thin and doubtful" case, the other
    as an "implausible" one. See Tri-Stata and Caribe BMW, be-
                                      624

low.) Do these qualify as plaintiff "wins" In Breyer's lex-
icon? If not, what cases is he talking about?

         The rest of the Breyer answer quoted above was evidently
intended to suggest that there was a "mix" of small and large
firms on both sides in his 19 antitrust cases. This is patent-
ly not true. Historically, antitrust defendants have been,
on average, some 30 times the size of antitrust plaintiffs and
that tendency is clearly present in his cases as well.

         In the table below, I've described (in a parenthetical
sentence) the opposing parties in each of Breyer's 19 cases.
His plaintiffs are largely local dealers or distributors, with
a couple of new-entrant, new-technology producers--all obvious-
ly small by virtually any definition (e.g., the SBA's less-than-
500 employees)--while his defendants are generally giant insti-
tutions (e.g., Chase Manhattan Bank, Blue Shield, Hearst news-
papers, Southern Pacific Railroad, Massachusetts Port Authori-
ty, Boston Edison) or big manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Subaru,
Welch Pood, Paccar (heavy trucks), SCM (photocopiers), ITT Grin-
nell, and Texaco.)

         Again, Breyer has misstated the facts. No antitrust plain-
tiff has ever won in his court. Similarly, the plaintiffs he's
consistently ruled against have all been small and the defen-
dants he's methodically favored--with his vote and his intellec-
tual effort--have virtually all been very large.

         Breyer is the candidate of big-business and monopoly in
America. He has never met a monopoly or a restraint on compe-
tition that he didn't like, ruling for the big-business defen-
dant, again, 19 times In 19 antitrust oases during his 14 years
on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. He Is credited with being
"even more conservative than Robert Bork" by his conservative
admirers, who gleefully note that he is the only Democratic
appointee among 157 federal appeals judges who has voted 100%
of the time for the big corporations charged with antitrust
offenses--the other 6 who have such "100%" records being all
Reagan appointees.

         Breyer is disdainful of small business, believing that
only the corporate giants can be "efficient." His unbroken
line of 19 decisions for the same side (historically, each side
in antitrust has won about half the time on appeal) shows a
determined unwillingness to decide on the merits. No anti-
trust plaintiff will ever win a case in his court, in a word,
he prejudges cases and nullifies laws he doesn't like.

         What does this tell us about his judicial qualifications?
About his impartiality, sense of justice, and judicial tempera-
ment? About his integrity and intellectual capacity? In his
antitrust decisions, there is not a trace of fairness or even-
handed application of the law. They reflect routine injustice,
a consistent ruling In favor of the economic bullies rather
than their victims--a result achieved by crabbed, mean-spirit-
ed interpretations of laws never intended as protectionism for
inefficient corporate giants.

          A host of business practices historically condemned as
monopolistic and unfair--that destroy efficient small firms
 and lead to monopoly prices for the public--have in effect been
 legalized in his court. Prioe discrimination, predatory (below-
 cost) pricing, exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, resale
 price fixing, and the like have all been consistently approved
by Breyer. There !· one conspicuous principle in his antitrust
                                      625

decisions! The corporate defendant always wins, no matter how
egregious the challenged conduct.

         To get this big-business-always-wins result, Brever has
routinely displayed his disrespect for Congress, rewriting the
statutes as he went, in effect-to borrow the favorite phrase
of Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)~"legislating from the bench."
He has, for all practical purposes, repealed an entire body
of law in his four-state (plus Puerto Rico) jurisdiction, in-
cluding the venerable Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and Clayton
Act (1914).

          Breyer's antitrust record displays a jimilar disdain for
the Constitution. Antitrust oases are among those in which,
under the 7th Amendment, "the right of trial by jury shall be
preserved." Again to achieve his blg-business-always-wins re-
sult in antitrust cases, Breyer has repeatedly overturned jury
verdiots for the plaintiffs or ordered their cases dismissed
before they reached the jury.

          intellect and Integrity? Breyer rationalizes his siding
with the economic bullies by claiming he's doing it all "for
 the consumer." In an Orwellian twist of the language, he theo-
 rizes that bigger must be more "efficient," so monopoly prices
must be lower than competitive prices. His so-called "economics"
 is ideological fiction churned out by laissez-faire ideologues,
 with no credible empirical or real-world support. A "jury"
of say 12 professional economists selected at randon from the
directory of the American Economic Association would find his
 economic theories hilarious.

          . In one of his cases (Interface v. Massport, 1987), Breyer
 suggested that those harmed by the monopoly practices at Boston's
Logan Airport could just go out and "build competing airports."

          . In his most recent case (Caribe BMW v. Bayerische Hotoren
 Herke, 1994), Breyer expressed perplexity as to how the plaintiff
 auto dealer could be simultaneously injured by a discriminatory
 price (charging him more for cars than his competitors paid)
 and a "maximum" resale price-fixing arrangement that prevented
 him from passing on that extra charge by raising his own re-
 sale prioes to the public. The mystery is how Breyer could
 not understand the familiar "price squeeze" the plaintiff was
 obviously complaining about--an artificial lacking-up of the
 price he paid his supplier and an artificial holding-down of
 the price he was permitted to charge his own customers, thus
 artificially narrowing his own margin below the competitive
 level.

          . in another case (Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell,
 1983), he wrote: "When prices exceed incremental [marginal
 or average variable] cost, one cannot argue that they must rise
 for the firm to stay in business." But in the airline industry,
 for example, marginal costs are estimated at less than 25% of
 full operating costs. A conpany can stay in business by cover-
 ing only one-quarter of its operating expenses? This is econom-
 ically siTTy\

          . The next year (in his Kartell v. Blue Shield, 1984),
he declared unambiguously that "to succeed, [a predatory-pricing
 case] requires a showing that the price was below 'incremental
 cost' (or the equivalent)," citing as his sole authority his
own decision of the preceding year (Barry Wright, above). The
U.S. Supreme Court, nearly a decade later (Brooke/Liggett v.
 B&w Tobacco, 1993), is itself still undecided as to the "ap-
 propriate measure of cost" in such cases.
                                      626

                In a price-discrimination case (Allen Pen Co. v. Spring-
field Photo, 1981), Breyer relied on the fact that the goods
on which the victim was overcharged (more than its competitors)
accounted for only 2% of that diaadvantaged firm's total busi-
ness. He nade no mention of the Supreme Court's holding (FTC
v. Morton Salt, 1948) that the price-discrimination law must,
of necessity, apply to each and every Individual item in a Mer-
chant's inventory If it is to have any real meaning, including,
in that case, table salt sold in a supermarket (accounting for
a fraction of 1* of its overall sales).

              Breyer rejects the traditional nation that one of anti-
trust's main purposes is the prevention of "unfair" competitive
practices, referring to such attacks on small enterprises as
mere "torts" which "lie beyond the purview of the antitrust
laws" (Kartell v. Blue Shield, 1964) and disparagingly char-
acterizing a Massachusetts statute prohibiting then as a "fair
trade" law (Xenworth v. Paccar, 19B4). The difficulty with
this Breyer "tort" theory is first that torts were illegal at
common law and were thus already illegal in 1690 when Congress
 passed the Sherman Act, doing so precisely because it found
 the existing tort law inadequate to deal with the trusts of
 the day, e.g., Standard Oil, American Tobacco, and the like.
 A second problem is that this Breyer notion is wildly at odds
 with a mountain of legislative history and Supreme Court rul-
 ings since 1890.

          . Rejecting "fairness" as even a part of the standard
 in antitrust, Breyer embraces a single criterion, what he calls
 "consumer welfare." The problem, though, Is that he defines
 this term to include not just consumers as members of house-
 holds (the conventional economic definition) but business firms
 as well. In mainstream economics, the interests of commercial
 organizations are designated by the term "producer welfare"
 but Breyer never mentions this. By lumping both consumers and
 entrepreneurs under the same label, "consumer welfare," he's
  able to claim that he's serving "consumers" even when families
  are being looted by anticompetitive practices, if both the
  individual citizen and the corporate monopoly are "consumers,"
  then the overcharging of the former by the latter merely "tran-
  sfers" money from the pockets of one "consumer" to another.
  Under this definition, the behavior of Willie Sutton--the gen-
  tleman who robbed banks "because that's where the money i s " --
  caused no loss of "consumer welfare." He simply "transferred"
  money from one "consumer" pocket to another, with no reduction
  in the total amount of money held by him and the bank together.

                  While the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the
   (federal) Sherman Act does not preempt the antitrust field rnd
  that the 50 states are accordingly free to enact and enforce
  substantively stronger antitrust laws if they like, Breyer holds
   (Cardova & Simonpietri Ins. v. chase Manhattan, 1981) that the
   states--while allowed to "occasionally" vary the "details" of
  their antitrust statutes from the federal model--must keep them
   "broadly consistent with general federal policy." Since state
   antitrust law long preceded the federal, this is an especially
   outrageous suggestion by Breyer.

            . Breyer defines "entry barriers" as costs facing new
   entrants that incumbents were spared. This is a word game that
   drains the term of all serious meaning. For example, under
   this definition, there would be no "barriers" confronting those
  denied fair access to Boston's Logan Airport (Massport, above),
   since they could presumably build a new one for the same num-
  ber of (inflation-adjusted) dollars as were sp«nt by the origi-
  nal Logan builders, in mainstream economics, entry barriers
                                   627

have an entirely different definition, namely, as costs facing
new entrants that allow incumbent firms to maintain hlgher-than-
competitive pricea (without inducing new entry that would force
their pricea back down). This traditional definition protects
the public from monopoly pricing; Breyer's does not.

               in other cases, Breyer ordered summary dismissal because
he wasn't persuaded that the defendants had "market power"--the
power to charge a price above the competitive level. But in
a case where he assumed such market power (Kartell v. Blue
Shield, 1984), he ruled that monopolists have a right to "ex-
ploit" their market power and, besides, that it's judicially
difficult to determine "what is a 'competitive' price." The
rules bend to gat a fixed result: The corporate defendant al-
ways wins. A court he sits on has no rightful claim to the
public's trust and confidence.

         In overturning the historic competitive-price standard,
Breyer sets aside all enforcement of, for example, the country's
merger law: In the Justice Department's 1992 Nerger Guidelines,
unlawful mergers are defined as those that create or enhance
the "ability profitably to maintain prices above competitive
levels." And of course public agencies whose job is to prevent
utilities from gouging the public routinely set prices intended
to approximate those that would prevail under competitive con-
ditional In holding that the competitive price level can't
be judicially determined, and that monopolists have a right
to "exploit" their monopoly power, Breyer rejects any form of
protection for the public from private economic power, whether
antitrust (to maintain competitive markets) or public regulation
(to restrain incurable monopoly pricing powerT.

               *?he underlying assumption in all Breyer's antitrust
rulings is that big is more efficient than small. It is a thor-
oughly false--indeed, a perverse--premise. It is almost univer-
sally the case that the largest firm in a given industry is
among its most inefficient, e.g., GM in autos, IBM in comput-
ers, and so on. In the airline industry, for example, the Big
5 carriers have unit (per-passenger-mile) costs that exceed
those of mid-size Southwest Airlines--and even the smallest
of the new startup lines--by 23% (American) to 48.6% (USAir).
Salaraon Bros., NY Times, 4/25/93.

           Only when the new administration intervened in early 1993
to stop the incessant predatory attacks by the Big 5 were those
efficient small airlines permitted to expand across the country
and thus trigger an overall decline in prices to the consumer.
It is a fairness or level-playing-field standard in antitrust--
the one Congress laid down when it passed these laws over 100
years ago--that deconcentrates markets and systematically low-
ers consumer prices. It is Breyer's unwillingness or inability
to grasp this central empirical fact of the real economic world
that makes him the national liability that he is.

         Sophistry is the hallmark of Breyer's antitrust decisions.
One can search in vain through them for even the slightest trace
of the "brilliant jurist" portrayed by his supporters. His
opinions are rambling, factually-incoherent lectures (purport-
ing to be "economic" theory) so poorly written--as can be ver-
ified by a visit to any county law library--that the reader
often has to go to the decision of the court below to find out
what had actually happened in the oases. Here all that's evi-
dent is either intellectual incompetence--captivity to the crude
19th century dogma that "big is efficient"--or equally crude
cheerleadlng for corporate giantism to gain "conservative" po-
litical support for an ambitious judicial career.
                                      628

         A judge's stand on antitrust is a revealing window into
his broader view of the general economic issues and his over-
all judicial philosophy. Antitrust has two vital functions
in America. First, it lays down the rules of the entrepreneur-
ial game for the nation's 20 million businesses, providing them
and their families with a "bill of rights," a shield against
unjust treatment by economic predators.

         N O less Importantly, antitrust is the nation's central
price-control mechanism. Without it, mergers and economic thug-
gery quickly transform competitive industries into sclerotic
monopolies and prices start to climb. With Breyer on the Su-
preme Court, its pro-monopoly majority will be so solid that
corporate lawyers will dutifully start telling their clients
the rules are now off, that the long-sought grail of laissez-
faire has at last arrived. With antitrust effectively repealed
by unelected judges, consolidation will accelerate even faster
and prices in health care, for example, will be rocketing even
further out of control as the voters go to the polls in '96.
When President Clinton named Breyer to the high court, he almost
certainly killed any serious chance of controlling health-care
costs during his presidency and, indeed, cut the strongest cable
that restrains prices at large.

         Stephen Breyer's 19 pro-monopoly votes spell out an ultra-
conservative economic agenda that he shares with Robert Bork
and Antonin Scalia. it is one that systematically transfers
very large amounts of money from consumers and efficient small
enterprises to corporate dinosaurs that are too inefficient
to compete on the merits and thus have to resort to economic
violence against their smaller, more efficient competitors to
survive. Even if Congress should rewrite the country's anti-
trust laws in a plainly-expressed effort to prevent this re-
sult, his record makes it plain that he would find a way to
evade it. His is a result-oriented antitrust jurisprudence
and no private antitrust plaintiff can ever expect to win his
vote. His confirmation by the Senate will Itself be read by
his 1,000 colleagues on the nation's courts aa an endorsement
of his antitrust views by Congress or of Its indifference to
that vital body of law and the economic havoc that its neglect
inevitably yields. On the Court, his votes and his pro-monopoly
advocacy will cost the nation--and the president--dearly indeed.

         "Every great mistake has a halfway moment," Pearl Buck
once wrote, "a split second when it can be recalled and perhaps
remedied." The U.S. Senate now has such a "halfway moment,"
a final chance to spare the D.S. and its president the appal-
ling costs of his greatest mistake, Stephen Breyer. it is the
one he will most regret In the years to come.

  Senator KENNEDY. Before concluding, I want to thank all of the
staff. They have been wonderful. All of us, Republican and Demo-
crat alike, rely on our dedicated men and women who help us, and
their efforts too often are overlooked or taken for granted. So I
want to thank all of them for the great work they have done in
helping all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as
working on the shaping of these hearings. They have done a really
outstanding job.
  We will now terminate these hearings and look forward to the
committee's meeting, as stated by the chairman, next week, and I
am confident it will be an overwhelmingly favorable vote for Judge
Breyer.
  I thank all of you for coming. The committee stands adjourned.

MMuamPuMc  For Immediate Release

                ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE ISSUES REPORT ON BREYER

                    Washington -- The Alliance for Justice, a national association of
           public interest legal organizations, including the Bazelon Center for
           Mental Health Law and the Native American Rights Fund, today issued
           its report on the nomination of Judge Stephen G. Breyer to become the
           108th Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

                    The Alliance report praises Judge Breyer's distinguished legal
           career, his dedication, and his intellectual prowess. It also notes that
           while these qualities tell us much about what kind of Supreme Court
           justice he will be, they do not tell us everything. The report says that
           the "public interest community believes the nation needs someone with
           a vision of how the law can serve ordinary Americans and protect them
           when government or private interests are overbearing." When these
           standards are considered, the report continues, Judge Breyer's record to
           date is mixed, and how he will perform on the Supreme Court is hard
           to predict.

                    "Since 1990, the Supreme Court has lost its three most
           passionate voices for justice: William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and
           now Harry Blackmun," said Nan Aron, Executive Director of the
           Alliance. "We need a Justice who will carry on their vision and
           idealism and help resurrect the Court as a promoter of rights and
           liberties of ordinary Americans," Aron added.

                    The Alliance report urges Judge Breyer to "attack the job with
           the humanity and grit that the greatest of his predecessors brought to
           the job." "The country needs someone who will breathe again into the
           Court the inspiration of a living Constitution that promises liberty and
           justice for all. If Judge Breyer uses his considerable talents to fulfill
           that role, he could become a truly great Supreme Court justice," the
           report slates.

                                      President Clinton has nominated Stephen Breyer to replace Justice
Manorial Woman · l a » Camr  Blackmun. Judge Breyer has had a distinguished legal career: Harvard
Nawa Atnancan Monti Fund     Law School professor, Chief Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
                             Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
 PuMc Adaocato. Inc.         He is hailed as a brilliant jurist, highly intelligent and dedicated. He is
                             also known to be very personable, and possesses exceptional consensus-
                             building skills.

                                      These qualities tell us much - but not all -- about what kind of
                             Supreme Court justice Steven Breyer would be, and which voids on the
                             Court he might fill and which balances he might shift. These qualities
                             do not tell us whether Judge Breyer would provide other attributes that
                             are sorely needed on the Court.

                                       President Clinton said that he was looking for someone who is
                             compassionate and who has a big heart, and few could doubt that the
                             Court's jurisprudence has greatly lacked compassion and heart in recent
                             years. The public interest community believes the nation needs someone
                             with a vision of how the law can serve ordinary Americans and protect
                             them when government or private interests are overbearing. We need a
                             justice with the creative idealism of an Earl Warren or Brennan,
                             Marshall, or Blackmun, who revered the Constitution as the ultimate
                             guarantor of equality and fairness in our society.
                                    633

         When these standards are used, Judge Breyer's record is mixed. His opinions display
a strong concern for procedural fairness, insisting that government agencies and officials
adhere to regulatory rules and guidelines. Yet, he is also extremely deferential to agency
officials and often interprets statutory protections for citizens in such a narrow manner mat
the original Congressional purpose of helping ordinary Americans gets lost. In Freedom of
Information Act cases, for example, his narrow interpretations have denied citizens access to
important information about government operations. And his approach in the area of
disability law has left citizens without remedies that they had reason to believe Congress
meant to be available. His opinions on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are so
restrictive that they undercut the law's spirit and broad purpose to ciirrunate the widespread
discrimination experienced by persons with disabilities.

         On issues of fundamental constitutional rights, Judge Breyer's record is mixed. His
opinions on First Amendment issues appear, on the whole, to protect freedom of speech and
association. His record also suggests a commitment to the constitutional right of privacy,
including a woman's right to choose, although it is not clear how broadly he would interpret
that right.

         This report shows a multitude of other areas in which Judge Breyer has adjudicated
cases in a moderate, careful, often meticulous but sometimes antiseptic way. They suggest
that Judge Breyer comes to the Court with many, but not all, of the qualities we should look
for in a Justice.

         Judge Breyer's intelligence, congeniality, and accessible style, combined with his
consensus-building abilities, suggest that he will assume an influential position on a Court
that continues to struggle to find its way on many issues. But surely he must do more on the
Court than search for consensus. Consensus does little to advance the cause of justice if the
agreed-upon principles are wrong. The Court needs, as much as consensus, Justices with gut
instincts to understand the struggles and needs of ordinary Americans and those who continue
to suffer from injustice.

          AS Judge Breyer ascends to one of the most important positions in the country, the
Alliance for Justice urges him to help fill the gaping void on the Court and attack the job
with the humanity and grit that the greatest of his predecessors brought to the job. The
Court and the nation need more than another very intelligent, competent Justice. The
country needs someone who will breathe again into the Court the inspiration of a living
Constitution that promises liberty and justice for all. If Judge Breyer uses his considerable
talents to fulfill that role, he could become a truly great Supreme Court justice.

                                                                          Court Noaw--oon ot Judg» stapn

BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION

         With degrees from Stanford (1959), Oxford (1961), and Harvard Law School (1964),
Judge Breyer began his legal career as a law clerk to former Supreme Court Justice Arthur
Goldberg. Thereafter, he combined a career in public service, working in a variety of
administrative and legislative positions, with teaching stints at Harvard Law School,
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and the College of Law, Sydney, Australia.
From 1979 to 1980, Breyer served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In
late 1980, President Carter appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit, where he is now Chief Judge. He is currently 55 years old.

         In addition to the numerous decisions Judge Breyer has authored, he has written
extensively on various topics in administrative law, particularly regulation and regulatory
reform. His scholarship complements his hands-on experience during the Carter
Administration, when he initiated airline deregulation. In 1987, the American Bar
Association recognized Judge Breyer's scholarship by naming him the recipient of its Annual
Award for Scholarship in Administrative Law.

         Judge Breyer also served as a commissioner on the United States Sentencing
Commission from 1985 to 1989. In that capacity, he was instrumental in crafting the federal
sentencing guidelines, which were intended to alleviate the unfairness and disparity in federal
criminal sentencing across the country. His work in reaching a consensus on the guidelines
has been highly praised, but the guidelines themselves have received criticism. Jack
Weinstein, Senior Judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, for example, has said that the guidelines "'require, in the main, cruel imposition of
excessive sentences." Quoted in Hentoff, Judge Breyer: Lots ofRoom for Dissent, The
Washington Post, June 4, 1994.

JUDICIAL RECORD

Equal Rights

         Judge Breyer's mixed record in equal rights cases illustrates his pragmatic and narrow
judicial approach. He is deferential to agency officials and tends to interpret statutory
provisions narrowly. Within such constraints, however, he displays a concern for reaching
fair and just results.

         Gender Discrimination - In Stathos v. Bowden, 728 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1984), Judge
Breyer upheld a finding of sex-based wage discrimination. Stathos involved two female
public employees who, according to an organizational chart prepared after a company
reshuffling, were of equivalent rank and duty to certain male employees earning significantly
more. Company officials refused to bring plaintiffs up to the same salary level, and over
time their pay continued to remain less than that of their male counterparts. Judge Breyer

                                     635

agreed with the lower court that defendants' evidence comparing male and female salaries at
other plants was irrelevant to the issue in this case, which was whether men and women at
the particular plant in question were paid equally. He also rejected defendants' claims that
they were entitled to a "good faith" immunity defense and that both the damages and
attorney's fees award were excessive.

         In Dragon v. State of Rhode Island, Dep't cf Mental Health. Retardation A Hospitals,
936 F.2d 32 (1st Cir. 1991), however, Judge Breyer affirmed the dismissal of a sex-based
wage discrimination claim. Donna Dragon had proved, to a jury's satisfaction, that although
she was classified and paid as a clerk typist, she had assumed most of the duties of "Equal
Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer" - duties that had previously been performed by her
male supervisor - and that her failure to receive pay commensurate with her duties was
based on her sex and in violation of the Equal Pay Act Judge Breyer assumed the same
legal standards applied to the Title VII claim at issue on appeal as the Equal Pay Act claim
decided by the jury. Nonetheless, he held that no reasonable person could find illegal sex
discrimination based on the facts of the case. He did not address in any detail the nature of
the jury decision, which was contrary to his own reading of the facts.

         Voting Rights - In Latino Political Action Oman., Inc. v. City of Boston, 784 F.2d
409 (1st Cir. 1986), Judge Breyer affirmed a district court decision that rejected a Voting
Rights Act challenge to Boston's districting plan for city council and school committee
elections. Plaintiffs had argued that the plan "packed" too many minority voters into two
districts (one was 82.1% African-American, 87.88% total minority; the other was 66.37%
African-American, 81.43% total minority), fragmented Hispanic voting power, and placed
one "racially and ethnically diverse" community in a district dominated by a "nearly all-
white" neighborhood. Judge Breyer upheld the district court's conclusion that the plan did
not deprive plaintiffs of equal access to the voting process. Among other things, Judge
Breyer ruled that the high proportion of minorities in the two challenged districts did not
render the plan automatically unlawful.

         Affirmative Action - In Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir. 1991), cert, denied,
112 S. Ct. 1948 (1992), Judge Breyer upheld a consent decree, first entered in 1980, that
required the Boston Police Department to provide preferential consideration to minority
officers fit malting promotions to sergeant. In 1990, a group of white officers challenged the
decree's continuing validity, arguing that the Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond
v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989) (striking down the city's minority set-aside
contracting program), had rendered the decree's race-based preferences unconstitutional.
Writing for the court, Judge Breyer rejected the argument. In so doing, he carefully
delineated Croson's precise holding and explained why "the race-conscious relief" embodied
in the challenged decree "represent[ed] a narrowly tailored effort, limited in time, to
overcome the effects of past discrimination." 931 F.2d at 45S.

         Similarly, in Massachusetts Assoc. of Afro-American Police Inc. v. Boston Police
Dept., 780 F.2d 5 (1st Cir. 1985) cert, denied, 478 U.S. 1020 (1986), Judge Breyer denied a
group of police officers' motion to intervene in a Title VII action. The officers sought to
challenge a consent decree that included affirmative action provisions designed to increase
the number of African-American officers promoted to sergeant.

         Criminal Violation of Civil Rights - in United States v. Maravilla, 907 F.2d 216 (1st
Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 112 S.Ct. 1960 (1992), two customs officers were charged with
several offenses, including violating an individual's civil rights by kidnapping and murdering
him. On that charge, a jury found the officers guilty, but Judge Breyer reversed on the
ground that the civil rights statute did not apply. Taking a very narrow view of the statute,
Breyer concluded that the victim was not an "inhabitant of any State, Territory of District"
because he was a foreigner who intended to stay in the United States for only a few noun.
Dissenting, Judge Torruella wrote that the term inhabitant did apply to the victim, "because
such construction is required as a matter of plain meaning, because it makes common sense
and is fair, because what skimpy legislative history there is, supports such a reading, and
lastly, because there is precedential support...." 907 F.2d at 229 (Torruella, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part). Torruella added:

                   In my opinion the majority's interpretation of § 242 does
                   violence to a longstanding scheme established to lend support to
                   the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. This
                   scheme requires interpretation of the supportive legislation in a
                   manner coextensive with that Amendment.

907 F.2d at 232 (citation omitted).

Right to Privacy/Reproductive Freedom

         Judge Breyer's record on the right to privacy is scant. He has participated in two
cases involving restrictions on the right to choose, voting to strike down one and uphold the
other. As a circuit court judge, Breyer is bound by Supreme Court precedent; thus neither
case provides a clear answer on his views about a constitutional right to reproductive choice.

         In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 899
F.2d S3 (1st Cir. 1990) (en bane), vacated, H I S . Ct. 22S2 (1991), Judge Breyer joined an
en bane decision that held unconstitutional the so-called "gag rule," the federal regulation
barring health care providers in federally-funded clinics from providing abortion counseling
or referrals to clinic patients. The court concluded that the regulations infringed upon
women's right to choose by curtailing the information available about pregnancy options and
violated the First Amendment. The opinion was later vacated in light of the Supreme
Court's ruling in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991).
                   637

         In another case, Judge Breyer dissented from a panel decision in Planned Parenthood
League of Massachusetts v. BeUotti, 868 F.2d 459 (1st Cir. 1989), which involved a
challenge to a state law that minors seeking abortions obtain parental consent or,
alternatively, judicial approval. At issue on appeal was whether the statute, in operation,
unconstitutionally restricted the right of minors to obtain abortions. Appellants requested
leave to compile a factual record to show that the statute was, in fact, unconstitutional. The
majority remanded the issue to the district court, but cautioned that plaintiffs' "burden [on
remand] to demonstrate unconstitutionality as applied" would be "considerable". 868 F.2d at
469. Dissenting, Judge Breyer wrote that the burden was one plaintiffs simply could not
satisfy. Even if their factual assertions were found to be correct, he said, they would not
"lead the Supreme Court to change its BeUotti 11 statement that such a statute is
constitutional." 868 F.2d at 470.

         Judge Breyer's view on another important right to privacy issue ~ gay rights - is
unknown. His only case dealing with the constitutional rights of homosexuals appears to be
Matthews v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 182 (1st Cir. 198S), which involved whether homosexual
conduct or status is grounds for dismissal from the military. The ROTC had discharged a
lesbian, following her voluntary admission that she was homosexual, and she claimed a
violation of her First Amendment rights. (It is unclear from the opinion whether the
constitutional rights asserted involved those of association or expression or both.) The
district court ordered her re-enrollment, and the Secretary of the Army appealed. Pending
the appeal, the plaintiff reapplied for admission, this time acknowledging that she had
"engaged in homosexual acts numerous times, last one being recently." Because of the
additional evidence, the appeals court panel felt compelled to remand the case to the lower
court for reconsideration. In a footnote, Judge Breyer dissented without elaboration, stating
only "that this court should not remand but should decide the merits of the appeal." 7SS
F.2d at 184.

Church-State Relations and Freedom of Religion

         Judge Breyer's fairly limited record makes it difficult to draw any confident
conclusions about his views on religious freedom. However, his self-described practical
approach to these issues suggest a substantial degree of deference to government decision-
makers both in matters of church-state separation and religious freedoms.

         In Members of Jamestown School Comm. v. Schmidt, 699 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), cert,
denied, 464 U.S. 851 (1983), the court reversed a district court opinion that struck down a
Rhode Island statute providing bus transportation to parochial school children. In a long and
detailed opinion, the court concluded that while the issue was a close one, the statute was
constitutional (with one exception). Concurring, Judge Breyer wrote separately to state his
belief that "the Establishment Clause calls for a more 'practical' approach" than the
"comparatively 'theoretical' one taken by the majority." He wrote that because the Supreme
Court had already held in Everson v. Bd. ofEduc., 330 U.S. 1 (1947), that such laws were
not designed to support religious causes but to promote public welfare, the actual question

AMunc* for JumtK*  Haport on W Syprwm Court Nonrntton of JUdgu Sttptun mwymr  f+g»~t
                      638

was whether unfair advantage had been afforded to parochial schools as a "practical"
matter - a question he answered negatively.

         Others cases involving religious freedoms in which Judge Breyer upheld government
action include Rupert v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 957 F.2d 32 (1st Cir. 1992) (per
curiam) and New Life Baptist Church Academy v. East Longmeadow, 885 F.2d 940 (1st Cir.
1989), cert, denied, 494 U.S. 1066 (1990). Rupert involved a statute that prohibited the
possession of rare eagle feathers but permitted Native American groups to obtain an
exemption for religious purposes. The pastor of a non-Native American group sought a
similar exemption on the ground that the group followed Native American religious customs.
After the request was denied, the pastor sued the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,
claiming a violation of the Establishment Clause. In a per curiam decision, the court
rejected the claim, holding that Native Americans enjoy special status under federal law and
that the government interest in preserving Native American religion and protecting the
dwindling eagle population justified its action. In New Life Baptist Church Academy, Judge
Breyer upheld a state statute requiring review and approval of secular education offered by
parochial schools, concluding that the state's interest in ensuring children receive an adequate
secular education was "compelling."

         Decisions in which Judge Breyer upheld the claims of private individuals or
organizations include Universidad Cent, de Bayamon v. N.L.R.B., 793 F.2d 383 (1st Cir.
1985) (en bane), in which Judge Breyer argued for an evenly divided court that the National
Labor Relations Board lacked jurisdiction over a university controlled by the Dominican
Order of the Roman Catholic Church. (Because the court was divided, it could not grant the
NLRB's request to enforce a collective bargaining order against the university.) Similarly, in
Aman v. Handler, 653 F.2d 41 (1st Cir. 1981), Judge Breyer vacated and remanded a district
court decision to deny a preliminary injunction to students who wanted to form a religious
organization on a state university campus. In doing so, he noted that he was following
Supreme Court precedent in Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169 (1972), which held that the First
Amendment prohibited the university from denying the group recognition based solely on the
group's philosophy.

Freedom of Speech and Association

         Judge Breyer has written a number of important free speech and association opinions,
many favorable to individuals claiming that their First Amendment rights were violated.
Indeed, his record in this area tends to display a good deal of sensitivity to victims of alleged
overreaching by government officials. In other cases, however, Judge Breyer has sided with
the government, displaying deference to officials.

         In Ozonoffv. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224 (1st Cir. 1984), Judge Breyer held
unconstitutional an Executive Order, as it applied to an agreement with the World Health
Organization (WHO), that required applicants for employment with WHO to undergo a
loyalty check. He ruled that the Order's terms relating to political advocacy were overly

Allianct for Justict  Htport on Hit Supnm* Court Nominmtnn of Judgt Sttphtn Bnytr  Pff 7
              639

broad under established First Amendment precedent, and consequently may have a chilling
effect on applicants' free speech rights. He wrote: "While we recognize that "overbrcadth"
must be measured in light of whatever special job-related security requirements that
governmental security or foreign policy needs may reasonably dictate, we conclude ... that in
this particular case those considerations are not important enough to save the Order." 744
F.2d at 230.

         In a number of cases involving the right of government officials to discharge or
demote employees for political reasons, Judge Breyer's practical judicial approach is
particularly evident. In Agosto-de-Felidano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209 (1st Cir. 1989)
{en bane), for example, Judge Breyer concurred in part and dissented in part that politically-
motivated employer action may violate employees' First Amendment associational rights. He
recognized that "the First Amendment protects a government employee's association with
others in a political party," but added that "a major reason the Constitution protects
associational rights is so that individuals can join together in working to elect a government
that will create practical programs of administration to carry out the policies they advocate."
889 F.2d at 1224. Thus, he said, courts analyzing political association claims "must
recognize not only that the lack of any protection can open the door to unwarranted,
politically based victimization, but also that too much judicial intervention may unjustifiably
interfere with the electorate's ability to see its political aims translated into action." Id.
(emphasis in original). He also confessed "to doubts" about the standards for review adopted
by the majority, questioning, among other things, "the abilities of the federal courts,
insulated from the political process, to determine which specific jobs in fact are politically
sensitive ...." Id. at 1225.

         Judge Breyer has upheld the First Amendment claims of discharged or demoted
employees in a number of cases. In Hemandez-Tirado v. Artau, 874 F.2d 866 (1st Cir.
1989), for example, he held that a government employee offered adequate evidence to
support a claim that political affiliation was a substantial, and thus unconstitutional, factor in
his demotion. See also Cam v. Aponte-Roque, 878 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989) (affirming denial
of summary judgment to Puerto Rico's Secretary of Education on claim that plaintiffs'
dismissals were politically motivated and thus violated First Amendment). Conversely, in
Nunez-Sow v. Alvarado, 918 F.2d 1029 (1st Cir. 1990), Judge Breyer vacated a district court
decision that denied summary judgment to defendants, who claimed qualified immunity on
the issue of whether their demotion of plaintiff, allegedly due to her political party affiliation,
violated the Constitution. In a 2-1 opinion, he held that the law in 1985 was not clear that a
politically-motivated demotion, as opposed to an outright discharge, was unconstitutional, and
thus defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. He rejected plaintiffs contention that
the demotion amounted to a "constructive discharge" in that it had the purpose or effect of
forcing her to quit (the law on "constructive discharge" was more clearly settled at the time).
Dissenting, Judge Torruella found the record "clear" that the defendants' actions were taken
to force plaintiff to quit, and stated that precedent "must have clearly signaled to appellants,
even in 1985, that their retaliatory actions against appellee because of her political beliefs
violated the Constitution of the United States." 918 F.2d at 1031.

Disability Law

         Judge Breyer's decisions in four disability law cases, including three under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, demonstrate two disturbing patterns.
First, they adopt a restrictive view of the legal entitlements of individuals with disabilities,
even in the face of contrary precedent and analysis. Second, they generally lack awareness
of or empathy for the every-day lives of the victims of disability-based discrimination. As a
result, the opinions fail to interpret the letter of the law so that disability-based discrimination
is remedied, and do little to advance the spirit of § 504, which was enacted "to eliminate the
'glaring neglect' of the handicapped." Alexander v. Ornate, 469 U.S. 287, 296 (1985)
(quotation omitted).

         In Ward v. Skimer, 943 F.2d 157 (1st Or. 1991), cert, denied 112 S. Ct. 1558
(1992), Judge Breyer narrowly interpreted the Supreme Court's directive that federal
agencies and grantees conduct an "individualized inquiry" to determine whether people with
disabilities are 'otherwise qualified" for employment. Ward concerned a truck driver with
epilepsy who was fired, after working for more than five years without incident, when his
employer learned of his disability. Ward asserted that the Department of Transportation
(DOT) violated % 504 by refusing to waive a regulation that prohibits people with epilepsy
from driving commercial vehicles.

         In holding that the DOT did not violate § 504, Judge Breyer declined to apply School
Board of Nassau County. Florida v. ArUne, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), the leading Supreme Court
case on the intersection between the employment rights of people with disabilities and safety
concerns. Had Judge Breyer utilized Arline's legal standard, he might have found, as have
many other federal courts, that proponents of blanket employment exclusions bear a heavy
burden, and that these exclusions rarely survive an individualized inquiry.

         Moreover, Judge Breyer ignored the possibility that DOT'S policies were based on the
types of "prejudices, stereotypes or unfounded fear" $ 504 was intended to eradicate. DOT
knew mat the risk of seizure or accident among drivers with epilepsy was "extraordinarily
low," but relied on findings that these risks "may be somewhat higher" for individuals who
sleep and eat irregularly or who forget to take their medication. Yet, although DOT
apparently did not inquire as to whether Mr. Ward had ever forgotten his medication, or
been adversely affected by irregular sleeping and eating habits. Judge Breyer found that
"further 'individualized* investigation ... is most unlikely to provide reasons for believing
[Mr. Ward] can drive commercial trucks safely."

         Wynne v. Titfs University School of Medicine, 932 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (en bane),
concerned a medical student with teaming disabilities who alleged that the "reasonable
accommodation" mandate, see Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 412
(1979); Ariine, 480 U.S. at 287-88 n.17, required the school to evaluate him through some
method other than multiple choice examinations. The Wynne majority rejected the view that
                                 641

academic decisions are beyond the reach of judicial review and held that the school had
failed to ademonstnt(e] that its determination that no reasonable way existed to accommodate
Wynne ... was a reasoned, professional academic judgment, not a mere ipse dixtt."

         Dissenting, Judge Breyer opined that academic institutions should be given substantial
deference in designing appropriate vehicles to evaluate student performance. Supporting the
medical school, he found that multiple choice tests were not a "substantial departure from
accepted academic norms." Unlike die majority, Judge Breyer would have denied the
plaintiff the opportunity to challenge the institution's view that reasonable accommodation
was impossible.

         Cousins v. Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, 880 F.2d 603 (1st
Cir. 1989) {en bane) concerned the DOT's refusal to allow people with hearing impairments
to drive commercial vehicles. Affirming the district court, Judge Breyer held that alleged
victims of discrimination by federal agencies cannot sue the federal government under $ 304.
Rather, he ruled that they had to first file complaints with federal agencies under the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), even though { S04 usually allows the victims of
discrimination to go directly to court. The ruling denied the victims of federal agency
discrimination the right to a trial before federal judges.

         In reaching these conclusions, Judge Breyer minimized the fact that the Supreme
Court had already considered a challenge to federal agency action based on § 304. As Judge
Breyer recognized, his analysis contradicted the "broader view" of other appellate courts.
Moreover, the Supreme Court subsequently cast doubt on Cousins' reasoning when it held
that federal courts lack the authority to order exhaustion of remedies through the APA when
exhaustion is not mandated by the relevant statute or agency rules. See Darby v. Cisneros,
61 U.S.L.W. 4679 (June 22, 1993).

         Finally, in Brewster v. Dukakis, 687 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1982) (not a § 504 case), the
district court had ordered that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts develop and pay for a
legal assistance program for people with mental disabilities who had been released from state
institutions pursuant to a consent decree. Judge Breyer vacated the order, however, holding
that the district court lacked the power to force the Commonwealth to pay for the
recommended program. In doing so, Breyer read the consent decree narrowly. Although he
admitted that "the district court is more familiar with the background of the litigation than
[the appellate court]," he rejected the lower court's finding that its actions were authorized
by three provisions of the decree. Judge Breyer held that neither the decree's "main
purpose" of deinstitutionalization nor the district court's "general equitable" powers
authorized the order.
                   642

AFDC and SSI Benefits

         Judge Breyer's decisions involving income benefit programs display a deference to
administrative agencies and a strict interpretation of statutory language.

         Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDO - Judge Breyer has written at least
four opinions involving the AFDC program. In three cases, he ruled against the plaintiff and
upheld AFDC eligibility restrictions and benefits reductions implemented by the state agency.
In the fourth, he stated in his concurring opinion that he would have dissented to the
majority's decision to strike down a benefits-restricting regulation if not for Congress's
timely offering of the Family Support Act of 1988, which settled the issue for the future.

         Judge Breyer's concurrence in Wilcox v. Ives, 864 F.2d 913 (1st Cir. 1988), evinces
his strong deference to agency officials. In 1988, a group of single-parent families receiving
AFDC filed an action against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The
action challenged the validity of an HHS regulation prohibiting the Maine Department of
Human Services from making multiple child support pass-through payments in a given month
if the payment total exceeded the $50 per month cap (payments belatedly received for prior
months were counted in the $50 total).

         The district court found that the regulation impermissibly contradicted the language
and purpose of the governing AFDC statute. The First Circuit agreed, holding that "[n]o
rational purpose is served by denying child support to a needy family because an employer
failed to promptly forward funds withheld from a paycheck or because the state itself has not
promptly entered the money onto its books." 864 F.2d at 920. Concurring, Judge Breyer
stated that he would have dissented, but that case history in other appellate courts supported
the panel decision and the timely-passed Family Support Act of 1988 adopted the view that
the $50 "pass through" only applies to payments made on time. Otherwise, he wrote

         in a case like this one, where the statutory provision is minor and interstitial,
         where the agency has a firm understanding of the relationship of that provision
         to otl.sr, more important, provisions of the statute, and where that
         understanding grows out of both the agency's daily experience in administering
         its statute and its familiarity with the initial drafting process, the Secretary's
         argument has considerable 'power to persuade.'

864 F.2d at 927.

         In Drysaale v. Spirito, 689 F.2d 252 (1st Cir. 1982), Judge Breyer upheld the
Massachusetts Department of Welfare's practice of finding non-AFDC recipient caretaker
parents ineligible for "earned income disregard" in the calculation of their children's AFDC
benefits. Breyer pointed to the statutory history of excluding custodial parents from
assistance benefits under the Aid to Dependent Children program (the precursor to Aid to
Families with Dependent Children). He also argued that the earned income disregard was

Amanc* for Jusoc*  Htport on th» Supnmt Court Nonwftton of Judo* Sttphon Bnytr
                    643

"solely ... an incentive for persons receiving AFDC to earn income and so remove
themselves and their families from the AFDC rolls, not... an incentive for people not
receiving AFDC to apply for AFDC.* 689 F.2d 252. Finally, Judge Breyer looked to the
language of the statute and concluded that a "relative claiming aid" referred to a relative
claiming aid to meet her own needs, not only those of her children.

         In a similar case, Evans v. Commissioner, Maine Dept. of Human Services, 933 F.2d
1 (1st Cir. 1991), Judge Breyer reversed the lower court's finding that the "earned income
disregard" applied to the income of a new husband in determining the on-going eligibility of
a family receiving AFDC benefits. Although the statute itself was unclear, Judge Breyer
ruled that finding such income ineligible for the disregard was in keeping with the
government purpose of "getting] people off the AFDC rolls, not putting] them on." 933
F.2d at 6 (quoting S.Rep.No. 744 90th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1967 U.S. Code Cong.
& Admin. News 744, 90th Cong., 2995-96).

         Finally, in Dickenson v. Petit, 692 F.2d 177 (1st Cir. 1982), Judge Breyer affirmed
the lower court's decision to deny plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. The
plaintiffs sought the injunction to restrain the state of Maine from terminating or reducing
their AFDC benefits in accord with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, which
reduced the size and duration of the earned income deduction to AFDC grants. The
plaintiffs argued for a literal reading of the "cut-off" provision, which would have allowed
them four additional months of the earned income deduction. Affirming, Judge Breyer wrote
that a "clever and literal reading" of the statute "may go directly counter to everything
Congress intended."

         Supplemental Security Income (SSD - In Constance v. Secretary of Health and Human
Services, 672 F.2d 990 (1st Cir. 1982), Judge Breyer reversed the lower court's ruling and
held that a state may reduce its portion of the SSI payment dollar for dollar by the amount
paid under a federal statute to the "essential persons" of SSI recipients. Judge Breyer
deferred to the administrative agency's decision and pointed out that Congress had intended
that states have the freedom to structure their SSI payments as long as they were above the
floor created by the federal SSI program.

         Similarly, in Usher v. Sweiker, 666 F.2d 6S2 (1st Cir. 1981), fudge Breyer upheld a
regulation reducing SSI benefits by the in-kind benefit derived by recipients renting below
fair market value from their children. Plaintiffs argued that the regulation unconstitutionally
discriminated against them as compared to SSI recipients who lived in federally subsidized
housing but did not have their benefits reduced. Judge Breyer found that the discrepancy in
treatment was rationally related to the reasonable government purpose of encouraging SSI
recipients to live in government housing.

         In cases in which plaintiffs have challenged the denial of benefits, Judge Breyer has
held agencies strictly responsible for fulfilling their burden to consider SSI applications.
Where the plaintiff established a prima facie case of disability and HHS denied the

                                 644

application without giving adequate evaluation or explanation, Judge Breyer has ordered die
Secretary to reconsider the application. See, e.g., Munoz v. Secretary of Health and Human
Services, 788 F.2d 822 (1st Cir. 1986). See also Vazquez v. Secretary of Health and Human
Services, 683 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982). However, he has also upheld HHS* determinations of
ineligibility where die plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proving a disability. See, e.g..
Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 690 F.2d S (1st Cir. 1982);
Geoffrey v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 663 F.2d 31S (1st Cir. 1981);
Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218 (1st Cir. 1981).

Access to the Courts

         Judge Breyer's access cases demonstrate a willingness to allow plaintiffs their "day in
court," counterbalanced by his deference to other branches of government. In cases
involving standing to sue, for example, he often has favored plaintiffs, taking a somewhat
broad view of the standing doctrine. He also had upheld several attorney's fees awards
against claims that they were excessive, again displaying a respect for the importance of such
awards to many plaintiffs. However, in cases involving other issues affecting access, such as
mootness and ripeness, his approach is narrow, and he often declines to reach the merits.
His access cases also show, as do other parts of his record, that he strictly interprets and
enforces procedural rules and guidelines.

         Attorney's and Expert Witness Fees - In Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d 287 (1st Cir.
1986), Judge Breyer vacated an opinion involving an attorney's fees award for civil rights
violations. Judge Breyer held that the district court was incorrect when it substantially
reduced the award to reflect the "limited 'extent of [the plaintiffs'] success'" on the civil
rights claims ($501) as compared with their success on a pendent state law claim ($300,000).
782 F.2d at 290. Judge Breyer ruled that "success" in a civil rights suit must be measured
qualitatively as well as quantitatively. He held that a reasonable fee was appropriate if
plaintiffs' other claims and the civil rights claims involved factually or legally related
theories, even though the damage award for the latter was significantly less. See also
Coalition for Basic Human Needs v. King, 691 F.2d S97 (1st Cir. 1982) (plaintiffs who won
injunction against cutoff of AFDC benefits during budget impasse entitled to attorney's fees
even though budget passed before injunction took effect); Lewis v. Kendrick, 944 F.2d 949
(1st Cir. 1991) (Breyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (disagreeing with
majority that plaintiffs request for unreasonably high attorney's fees forfeits right to any
fee).

         In Denny v. Westfield State College, 880 F.2d 1465 (1st Cir. 1989), the majority held
that expert witness fee awards in Title VII cases are governed by a Congressional statute
limiting such awards to $30 a day; it rejected plaintiffs' contention that expert witness fees
fall within Title VU's general "reasonable attorney's fee" provision. Judge Breyer
concurred, but wrote separately to note that the $30 cap was limited to "attendance at trial."
He suggested that expert fees for non-attendance work may fall within the Title VII
provision, but noted that plaintiffs in this case had not sought recovery for any such work.

         Standing - In Munoz-Mendoza v. Pierce, 711 F.2d 421 (1st Cir. 1983), Judge Breyer
found certain Boston residents had standing to challenge a decision by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide a grant to the City of Boston to help
develop a multi-million dollar commercial complex. Plaintiffs argued that HUD did not, as
required, make an appropriately thorough study of the possible negative impact of the
complex on racial integration in the area. Judge Breyer first rejected plaintiffs' argument
that they had standing (would suffer "injury in fact") because they would have to pay
increased rents or move from their homes as a result of increased housing demand generated
by the complex. He considered too speculative that particular individuals would incur rent
increases and that such increases would be the result of the HUD grant. Judge Breyer did,
however, find standing for certain of the plaintiffs on the ground that the complex would
generally increase housing demand and rents in nearby neighborhoods, thereby displacing
low-income (disproportionately minority) tenants and leading to a less integrated community.
See also Caterino v. Barry, 8 F.3d 878 (1st Cir. 1993) (employees seeking transfer of
pension fund assets to new pension plan have standing to sue trustees who refused to transfer
assets); Maine Association of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Maine Department of Human
Services, 876 F.2d 1051 (1989) (reversing lower court's dismissal for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction; despite doubts that plaintiff can convince state court of its standing, it "should
have a chance to try"); Ozonoffv. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224 (1st Cir. 1984) (applicant for job
with World Health Organization has standing to challenge Executive Order requiring loyalty
check for individuals seeking employment with certain international organizations).

         Mootness and Ripeness - Judge Breyer has taken a narrow approach to questions
involving the timeliness of judicial review, as reflected in cases involving mootness and
ripeness. For example, in Roosevelt Campobello Int'l Park Comm'n v. EPA, 684 F.2d 1034
(1st Cir. 1982), he held that judicial review of an EPA construction permit award was
premature because the permit had expired and reactivation of it was still pending. Similarly,
in Allende v. Schultz, 84S F.2d 1111 (1st Cir. 1988), Judge Breyer concurred in an opinion
that the State Department violated the First Amendment when it denied a visa to the widow
of a former Chilean president on the ground that her activities (primarily making speeches)
would be detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States. Breyer agreed with
the merits of the majority's opinion, but asserted that the action should be considered moot
because the plaintiff had received a visa and current law prohibited denials of visas on the
basis of constitutionally-protected beliefs and associations.

         Statute of T|-jnvfrHMHM - Judge Breyer appears to take a strict approach in statute of
limitations cases. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Banco Central Corp., 917 F.2d 664 (1st Cir.
1990) (RICO statute of limitations begins to run when plaintiff knows or should know of
injury; rejecting Third Circuit view that limitations period starts when plaintiff knows or
should know about last predicate act in racketeering activity); Lopez v. Citibank, N.A., 808
F.2d 90S (1st Cir. 1987) (no absolute rule tolling statute of limitations in employment
discrimination case for plaintiff with mental disability); Freund v. Fleetwood Enterprises
Inc., 956 F.2d 3S4 (1st Cir. 1992) (amended complaint naming proper defendant could not,
                                    646

under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), "relate back" to original complaint as neither original nor
subsequently-named defendant received notice of suit within statute of limitations period).

Freedom of Information Act

         Judge Breyer's general deferential attitude toward government agency action seems to
be reflected in his only two opinions involving the Freedom of Information Act. In both
instances, he voted to uphold agency claims of exemption.

         The more disturbing of these opinions is Irons v. FBI, 880 F.2d 1446 (1st Cir. 1989)
(en bone), in which Judge Breyer reversed a panel opinion ordering the FBI to release to
McCarthy Era historians information contained in the FBI's files concerning the prosecution
of Communist party leaders under the Smith Act. The requested information included
records of what informants who later testified at the Smith Act trials had told the FBI in
earlier interviews.

         The FBI invoked FOIA exemption 7(d), which permits the government to withhold
information compiled in connection with a criminal or national security investigation when
that information "could reasonably be expected to disclose ... information furnished by a
confidential source." A circuit panel first ruled that the informants had waived the protection
of the exemption with respect both to the information they actually revealed as trial witnesses
and any information that might have fallen within the scope of cross-examination.

         Writing for the en bone majority, Judge Breyer held that die panel's view of waiver
was an impermissible interpretation of the 7(d) exemption. He found that the phrase
"furnished by a confidential source" should be read to mean only that the information was
originally provided in confidence, not that the information or the identity of the informant
must be secret. Thus, he concluded, even if the informants' identities and the substance of
their testimony were matters of public knowledge and public record, the information they
provided to the FBI that was not revealed at trial could be kept confidential.

         The opinion not only flies in the face of a common sense reading of the FOIA, it
appears to be inconsistent with the general purpose of the act to favor public disclosure in the
absence of a strong government interest in concealment. See also Aronson v. Internal
Revenue Service, 973 F.2d 962 (1992).

Antitrust

         Judge Breyer, who has a keen interest and expertise in antitrust law, generally
interprets the antitrust laws narrowly. Professor William Kovacic of George Mason
University School of Law, maintains that Judge Breyer's opinions reflect a "conservative
perspective." In a 1991 law review article, Kovacic favorably compared Judge Breyer's

.nmmte* tor JutOcmffporton  am Suprmm* Court Nonmiion ot Juag* SUphmt
                     647

antitrust cases with those of Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th
Circuit. He further wrote:

                   "In a number of instances, Judge Breyer's antitrust opinions
                   have adopted conservative perspectives in evaluating the legality
                   of challenged distribution practices and single-firm pricing
                   conduct. In addressing these and other antitrust issues, the
                   Breyer opinions have expressed recurring concern about
                   adopting conduct rules that would diminish incentives to
                   compete and about the administrability of suggested liability
                   standards. In particular, Judge Breyer has played an influential
                   role in discouraging consideration of the defendant's subjective
                   expressions of intent in evaluating claims of unlawful
                   exclusion."

Kovacic, "Reagan's Judicial Appointees and Antitrust in the 1990s," Fordham L. Rev., Vol.
60, pp. 95-96 (1991) (footnotes and citations omitted).

         Kovacic noted that "[d]uring the survey period [1977-1990], Judge Breyer cast 17
votes in antitrust matters. Each vote supported the defendant's position ...." Id. at 95
(citing opinions). Judge Breyer's opinions include: Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT General
Corp., 724 F.2d 227 (1st Cir. 1983) (approving price cut by manufacturer with 94 percent of
U.S market to country's biggest user of product in exchange for commitment to purchase
'nearly all' requirements from maker); Interface Group, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Auth.,
816 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1987) (no violation of Sherman Act when airport operator refused free
ground services to charter service, requiring charter company to buy ground service from
airport operator's exclusive seller of such services at airport); Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron

liability in predatory pricing case); Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 858
F.2d 792 (1st Cir. 1988) (overturning jury verdict for car dealer that was denied yearly
allocation of cars until it agreed to accept unwanted "part kits"); Monahan's Marine v.
Boston Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525 (1st Cir. 1989) (rejecting liability in price discrimination
case); Town of Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1990), cert, denied,
499 U.S. 931 (1991) (rejecting claim of two towns alleging that electric utilities' "price
squeeze" intended to monopolize local distribution).

The Environment

         Judge Breyer's opinions in environmental cases are mixed. In somewhat
uncharacteristic form on the issue of deference to agencies, he has twice ruled that agencies
were wrong in not preparing environmental impact statements (EIS). However, in United
States v. Ottati A. Goss, Inc., 900 F.2d 429 (1st Cir. 1990), a case involving clean-up of a
hazardous waste site, Breyer largely upheld the district court's substantive findings against a
claim by the EPA that the court should have ordered more stringent clean-up relief.

Moreover, as discussed in the next section of this report, Judge Breyer has authored a
number of exceptionally critical writings on the efficacy of health, safety, and environmental
regulations. Those writings call into question how he will rule on statutes and regulations
designed to reduce or eliminate risks to public health and welfare.

         Judge Breyer has decided four cases involving agency failures to prepare
environmental impact statements (EIS), ruling for the agencies twice and private parties
twice. In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Watt, 716 F.2d 946 (1st Cir. 1983), Judge
Breyer upheld a preliminary injunction obtained by environmental organizations to stop the
Department of Interior from auctioning off oil-drilling rights in the North Atlantic fishing
area. The issue was whether the Department had to prepare a supplementary EIS under the
National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), because of a significantly revised estimate
of oil reserves in the area. Holding that a supplementary EIS was required, Judge Breyer
noted NEPA's purpose of making government officials consider environmental impacts in
their decisionmaking. Moreover, he continued, as a practical matter the more the
Department is allowed to sell oil-drilling rights and encourage development by private
parties, the more the Department and the private parties may become entrenched and
committed to their investment even if a negative supplementary statement is released. See
also Siena Club v. Marsh, 769 F.2d 868 (1st Cir. 1985) (vacating and remanding district
court decision that would have allowed construction of causeway and port facility without
submission of EIS).

         Judge Breyer upheld an agency decision not to prepare an EIS, however, in City of
Waltham v. United States Postal Service, U F.3d 235 (1st Cir. 1993). Affirming the Iowa-
court, Breyer ruled that the factual record indicated that the project would not significantly
affect the quality of the environment. See also Citizens for Responsible Area Growth v.
Adams, 680 F.2d 835 (1st Cir. 1982) (EIS not required for private construction of hanger for
corporate jets; project not sufficiently federal in nature to make NEPA applicable).

         In a long-running case, United States v. Ottati &. Goss, Inc. 900 F.2d 429 (1st Cir.
1990), Judge Breyer largely upheld the district court's findings in a suit concerning clean-up
of a 34 acre hazardous waste site in Kingston, New Hampshire. The appeal involved the
EPA's actions with respect to one of several companies sued for clean-up costs. Although
the district court adopted most of the EPA's suggestions for relief, the EPA claimed on
appeal that the court should have ordered more stringent relief as to certain contaminants.
Judge Breyer affirmed most of the lower court's factual findings, but remanded for further
proceedings on one of the three challenged contaminants. In most respects, he held that the
factual record adequately supported the court's conclusions.

         Judge Breyer later referred to the Ottati case in questioning the efficacy of
governmental attempts to clean-up the "last ten percent" of the risks posed by environmental
contaminants. In his book, Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Effective Risk Regulation
(1993), at 11-12, Breyer questioned whether it would be worth spending $9.3 million to
                   649

protect children who might at some time in the future eat some of the contaminated dirt that
would otherwise be left in place at the challenged New Hampshire site. (See below for a
further discussion of Breaking die Vicious Circle.)

LEGAL WRITINGS: REGULATORY REFORM AND RISK REGULATION

         Judge Breyer's prolific extra-judicial writings reflect a special interest and expertise in
regulatory reform and risk regulation, on which he was written several books and articles.
As with his judicial opinions, the writings convey a detailed and analytic approach to
identifying problems and p-oposing possible solutions. Breyer's approach is exemplified in a
speech he gave while he was Chief Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee: "If you want
regulatory reform, you take one agency, you look at it in extreme, exhausting detail, and
then you produce major change within that one agency." Proceedings of the National
Conference on Federal Regulation; RflfldS tff RcfonUi Sept. 27-28, 1979, reprinted in
Administrative Law Review, vol. 32, no. 2 (Spring 1980).

         While praised for their depth and accessibility, Breyer's writings on regulatory reform
and risk assessment have been criticized as decidedly anti-regulatory in nature and based on
questionable scientific evidence about health, safety, and environmental dangers. In 1981,
Judge Brever published one of his best known works, Regulation and Its Reform. In the
book, Brever takes a skeptical view of the efficacy of government intervention in the
marketplace. He recognizes that regulation is sometimes necessary to correct market
failures, but tends to minimize those failures and trumpet an unfettered free market as a
better cure for societal problems and inequities.

         Breyer's most recent - and arguably controversial - book is Breaking the Vicious
Grcle: Toward Effective Risk Regulation. Published in 1993, the book discusses at length
Breyer's ideas of risk assessment and refitting the nation's federal regulations on health,
safety, and the environment. Using the example of regulatory efforts to reduce exposure to
cancer-causing substances, Judge Breyer argues that relatively few people die from cancer
whose incidence could have been reduced by regulation. Questioning the efficacy of the
regulation of pesticides, asbestos, benzene, and other contaminants, Breyer concedes that
health and environmental regulations are necessary to reduce risks posed by toxic chemicals
but nearly always minimizes the magnitude of those risks.

         Breaking the Vicious Grcle has drawn particular criticism. Several experts on risk
assessment argue that Breyer's conclusions stem from a over-reliance on the work of
scientists who discount environmental risks. According to Thomas McGarity, Professor of
Law at the University of Texas, Breyer accepts the opinions of experts who triviliaze
environmental dangers and rejects those of experts who take them more seriously. McGarity
says that this leads Breyer to conclude that environmental activists and the media have
steered Congress into creating a regulatory atmosphere in which agencies force well-meaning
companies to waste scarce resources trying to eliminate the "last ten percent" of the risks

.*mmct tor JuMtc*  Htpott on mm Supnmo Court NonrnmHon of Judgm stmphmn moyS  Pago IS
                                 650

posed by environmental contaminants. While many experts - and ordinary citizens --
believe mat federal agencies should "err on the side of safety," Judge Breyer believes that
such an approach leads society to spend too many dollars chasing after trivial risks.

         How influential Judge Breyer's views on regulatory reform and risk assessment will
be in Supreme Court deriskximaking is unclear. While his judicial record displays a strong
deference to agency officials and narrow statutory interpretation, there are indications that he
will be more inclined to challenge agency decisions in these areas. First, he has in the past
questioned the ability of judges to faithfully adhere to the principle that they should defer to
agencies' "reasonable" interpretations of statutes when they themselves believe such
interpretations are wrong:

         [The deference] formula asks judges to develop a cast of mind that often is
         psychologically difficult to maintain. It is difficult, after having examined a
         legal question in depth with the object of deciding it correctly, to believe that
         the agency's interpretation is legally wrong, and mat its interpretation is
         reasonable. More often one concludes that there is a "better" view of the
         statute ... and that the "better" view is "correct," and the alternative view is
         "erroneous."

Breyer, Judjcjftl Review of Questions, flf l a w ant^ Policy. 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363 (1986).
Given his expertise with respect to risk regulation, Justice Breyer may have a tendency to
substitute his own conclusions for those of health and environmental agencies.

         Second, in his four opinions involving agency decisions not to prepare environmental
impact statements, he has twice overturned the agency decision. Given that the Supreme
Court has not once in NEPA's twenty-five year history rukd against an agency, Judge
Breyer's apparent willingness to do so half the time may indicate that he is inclined to show
less deference on healthy, safety, and environmental issues than on others.

CONCLUSION

         Stephen Breyer is a thoughtful, careful, and highly intelligent judge, and he will likely
be a very competent and influential justice. The Alliance for Justice urges him to use his
considerable talents to solemnly protect the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of equal justice
under law, preserve legislative commitments to environmental and consumer protection, and
ensure that the courthouse doors remain open to all who are wronged by government, not
just the rich and powerful.

                      STATEMENT
         OF CHARLES MERRILL MOUNT
        to the United States Senate
        Committee on the Judiciary

                           on
The Nomination of Stephen C . Breyer
to the United States Supreme Court
                              652

Ladies and Gentleman of the Judiciary Committee. Good
morning. I am Charles Merrill Mount and I have come here
to oppose confirmation to the United States Supreme Court
of Stephen G. Breyer.

         I do so with profound apologies to President Clinton.
It grieves me infinitely to oppose a President whom I
consider to be extraordinarily decent and well-meaning as
a man. But I act as a matter of conscience and to save this
country the presence on the Supreme Court of a man morally
and ethically unfit. The President has chosen a candidate
whose patented dualism, of portentious principles expounded
in public and vicious retaliations in private, show him to
lack the essential quality of judicial impartiality. Moreover
Judge Breyer has demonstrated an absolute contempt for the
Constitution and into this he has led the First Circuit. At
Boston no matter of constitutional magnitude receives fair
Hearing, nor even respectful Hearing. I shall spell this out
for benefit of the Committee by Article, Section, and
Amendment.

        But first I must tell you who I am and how I came to
be concerned with Judge Breyer. To start at the beginning
than, some members of this Committee may know me, or at
                                   653

least find me familiar. Senator's Hatch, Thurmond, and
Simpson surely recall that my friend the former Chief Counsel
of this Committee, Francis Coleman Rosenberger, had me paint
a large portrait of Senator Eastland at the time of his
retirement in 1978. Senator De Concini walked through this
Hearing Room on the Saturday when Francis Rosenberger, J.C.
Argitsinger, and some others had a scaffold erected to hand
the portrait on that wall, where I am sorry to see i t no longer
is present. That day may have been auspicious in other
respects tooi I recall Senator De Concini remarking that the
Bill to double the federal judiciary was to be voted on at
1 O'clock.

       Senator Kennedy may recall me too. With his respect for
scholarship and enormous humanity he arranged for me to have
an office in the Library of Congress, which caught me up in
the soiled conspiracies of that place which destroyed my
career and ultimately brings me here today. Senator Kennedy
i s not to blame. He does not know what transpires inside the
Library of Congresst his only impulse was compassion for a
well-known historian like myself whose real home is Dublin,
in Ireland, which my heart never has l e f t . There I l e f t behind
a wife and four children whom Judge Breyer has made certain
I shall never see again.

       Senator Biden knows ma too. One Sunday long ago when
his brother was being married in Delaware his vote was needed
                                654

on a finance Bill. He rubfted back to Washington and in striped
trousers and morning coat cast his vote. That duty performed,
he stood with me on the steps of the Senate Wing to await an
ambulance that with screaming sirens would take him back to
National Airport. I was immensely flattered that a man so
eminent and beautifully dressed would stop for frivolous
conversation with me at a moment of such strain. Senator
Blden. you are not just Chairman of this Committee. You are
a nice man.

       What I, an artist and historian, do before a Committee
of the United States Senate may well be asked. My first book
of history, published when I was twenty-six, was a biography
of the great American artist John Singer Sargent. THE NEW
YORK TIMES listed it for biography in its BEST BOOKS OF THE
YEAR and later it was chosen by Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy for
the Presidential Library she was forming in the White House
as her example of the new variety of American Biography. An
influential book critic wrote of my later biography MONETi

         Mount is a biographer virtually unique in the
          20th centuryi the supreme example of the writer
          as devil's advocate. He takes nothing for granted,
          certainly not the self-portraiture of his subject.
          A portrait-painter himself, his overriding aim
          is truth, no matter how unpalatable it may be.
How then did this "biographer virtually unique in the 20th
century become transformed into federal prisoner number
16*31-038, and how did the Chief Judge of the First Circuit
                                655

keep him that way for six years? Why is it that every
Memorandum Decision he wrote was Barked NOT FOR PUBLICATION?
What horrible secret has Stephen G. Breyer been keeping right
up to the threshold of this Hearing Room?

       We must examine together how it happened that all the
irregularities of a railroading trial, including denial of
all indigent subpoenas for witness, denial of documentary
evidence, trial for a crime not on the indictment, trial at
Boston contrary to the constitutional bar for a crime alleged
to have taken place in Washington, were denied again and again
by this man whom today is presented before this Committee of
the Senate as a paragons of judicial virtue.

       The essential matter to be recalled is that like most
active historians most of my life I had collected manuscript
documents. Now, grown old and ill, recovering from a stroke,
to sell some of these on the understanding that my active
career was over, I travelled to Boston where Goodspeed's Book
Store advertized that it paid cash for autograph letters. Only
when I appeared in Boston I was arrested. For a few weeks
thereafter I was beseiged by the media. Invitations to appear
on television were frequent. The newspapers sent Reporters
whom knocked on my door three and four a day. To the more
acute Philip Shenon of THE NEW YORK TIMES when he appeared
at my door I commented with a la ugh i "You're the only one
today - I was feeling neglected". Hustling past me into my
                                656

very Bod«8t accomodation Shtnon's first words weret "This
ease doesn't make sense. Were you set up?"

For trial at Boston I was brought before United States District
Judge Rya Weickert Zobel, a remarkable experience. A holocaust
survivor whoa has had numerous other names, trial before her
was not unlike being tried by Zsa Zsa Gabor. Judge Zobel's
utterances made an unstable sense in her mind alone* and
because she equated the gossip of Boston on equal basis
with judicial proceedings in the court before her, she saw no
need for all the impedimenta of trial which has come to be
called "constitutional rights". To be certain of conviction
she denied me all indigent subpoenas for witnesses and most
documentary evidence was not admitted. My doom was a certainty.

       My court appointed attorney, Charles P. McGinty of the
                                   657

Pederal Defender Office, refused to listen to me concerning
The Boston Athenaeum. It was named in FBI Reports of
conversation with the Book Store, and we noted that Judge
Zobel altered any piece of evidence, and even l e t t e r s , naming
i t . That I should have suffered for so many years from The
Boston Athenaeum, due to i t s slanders and libels lost two
wires and five children, then been arrested across from The
Boston Athenaeum on Beacon Street, is improbable at best.
That in telephoning the Library of Congress the FBI should
have contacted no high official but the petty functionary
whom had been spreading the same Boston Athenaeum defamations,
stretches credulity.

       But in his own way Charles P. McGinty had a certain
genius. He instructed me to trace the history of each of the
16? documents on the indictment. As an experienced historian
I was able to give him individual reports, which he used to
great effect while the government attempted to prove the
documents belonged to them. There was electricity in the
air of that courtroom when after each government "expert"
gave evidence by inference and belief, McGinty rose and cut
them to pieces. Often he showed significant portions of the
history were suppressed and replaced by pious claim for
which no evidence existed.

       Then, on the fourteenth day of trial, McGinty rose on
a motion to strike. I read from the transcript 1
                                 658

              MR. MCOINlYi Your Honor, with respeot to th« other
exhibits, ay notion to strike had Identified certain exhibits
for whloh th«r« w«r« Insufficient proof of ownership by th«
Library of Congress and Insufficient proof of ownership at
trial by the National Archives. They are listed, and there Is
a substantial number of then that are Hated on ay Motion.

              THE COURT· This Is the motion filed on the *th?
              MR. MCGIITTYi The motion to strike exhibits as just
characterised.
              THE COURTi Okay. Well, some of those have now gone
out, 30 to 39 are out.
              MR. MCGINTTi Correct.
              THE CODRTi One -- 93 to 96. 98, 100 to 202 are
out. So, 100 to 202 are out. 189 to 207 are out. And as for
the others, the motion Is denied. And the motion to seal.
       Of 167 documents on the Indictment, McGlnty had forced
dismissal of 135, or seventy per cent. Any Impartial Judge
must have recognized that the government's case was just se
much nonsense and granted the motion to acquit which followed.
But I was not before an Impartial judge. Working In tandem
McGlnty and I had achieved the Impossible. We had proved the
documents were not government property ss claimed, - and I
was convicted. The sheer brilliance of this accomplishment
requires amplification.
       The dynamics of a trial Includes elements never mentioned
at Law School. Born at Zwickau, Germany, December 18, 1931,
                                   659

and tragically orphaned, Judge Zobel was a hearily aocented
dirorce lawyer without federal court practice or experience
when this Committee added her to the roster of federal judges.
Become the Holly-Golightly of the federal judiciary, anyone
suffering through her courtroom performance, noting her
obsessions and delusions, her ferocious will to dominate and
craving for adulation (every tirade was punctuated by sweet
smiles to the jury) must wonder if she is entirely sane.

       That her ire was concentrated on me quickly became known
to the jury. When a blind man staggered into the courtroom
and all but fell into my lap, she called out to me in a tone
of severe reprimand. When I made objection to the fact the
government had gone into my sealed gift to the Library of
Congress, and was cross-questioning me from those documents
sealed in my lifetime, she declared me in contempt and sent
me to Salem Jail. She credited Boston gossip, or an interview
with The Boston Athenaeum, so completely that she sat before
the court somber like a chapter of the Apocalypse. £et no
one from THE BOSTON ATHENAEUM appeared to give testimony
under oath, lest we cross-question that party about David
McKibbin's theft of my proof sheets, his own plagiaries and
those of Richard Ormond, the libels with actual malice published
in London and New York, and their more recent reiteration.

       Forgetting that the Bible begina with a cunning snake
but ends with Revelations, Judge Zobel gave an involuntary
                                660

shudder each time aha looked at me, denied ne all indigent
subpoenas for witnesses whether from Ireland or the United
States, an* allowed me no documentary evidence. The government
meanwhile was allowed to fly into Boston scores of pseudo-
experts from every part of the country. In the vernacular
peculiar to such matters this process is known as "railroading",
and in this Judge Zobel proved herself one of the most blatant
and devoted Railroad Engineers in history. The jury little
noted nor long remembered that the documents themselves had
been proved my own property in clear title. Every government
witness, and the list was extensive, gave evidence not to
the indicted crime of "transportation", to to THEFT. On the
fourteenth day of trial, almost immediately after 135 documents
were dismissed leaving the government* s case smashed and in
tatters, in his summation the prosecutor boldly said to the
Jury i

             How do we know that he stole these documents
             from the Library of Congress?
What documents? Everything claimed by the Library of Congress
had been dismissed from the trial.

Here enters Hon. Stephen G. Breyer, whom the President has
nominated to the Supreme Court subject to the Confirmation
                                    661

of this Committee. From this point forward we hare opportunity
to examine whether this man believes in justice as the primary
mission of the federal courts, and whether he would "preserve
and protect the Constitution of the United States", or ever
has done so.For with "railroading" by Judge Zobel as established
fact, it was Judge Breyer, after he became Chief Judge of the
First Circuit in April, 1990, whom barred my escape from her
injustice.

         The Committee knows my background. But Judge Zobel had
been told ex parte and extrajudicially, by which I mean outside
the court or in chambers, not where my attorney and I could
hear or challenge its truth, that (1) I had appropriated David
McKibbin's work on Sargent, and (2) that I was a picture
forger. The sensational and groundless talk circulated at
Boston showed me to be a truly accursed character, and Judge
Zobel had acted on this. The proper enquiry of this Committee
now is to examine whether Judge Breyer acted in an ethical
manner and with scrupulous adherence to his oath of judicial
impartiality.

        Of my direct appeal the less said the better. The Appeals
Court appointed an attorney who made no pretense of seeking
to reverse the district court. He refused all contact with
me, neither accepting telephoae calls nor answering letters.
I was appalled at the continuation of a railroading suffered
in the lower coirt. The appeal process completed in Boston,
                                   662

to atone for a crime nev«?r committed long years of wrongful
imprisonment stretched before me. My court appointed lawyers
had finished their tasks. Left to myself, slowly I began a
campaign by Habeas Corpus. The numbers of issues were phenomenali
one 2255 motion (for such they are called) succeeded another.

       Judge Zobel of course denied each effort out of hand.
Her ear to the ground, she knew what Boston gossip said of me.
My 2255 motions thereafter reach the First Circuit on appeal,
where a panel of which Chief Judge Breyer was the most prominent
member examined them for legal probity. By a decision dated June
28, 1991, and marked NOT FDR PUBLICATION, Judge Breyer ripped
apart four of my submissions. These were a third 2255 motion,
a second motion for recusal of Judge Zobel, a Rule 27 motion
to Declare Nullity, and a motion for Evidentiary Hearing.

        Judge Breyer's unique judicial approach becomes apparent,
for in this decision he first reduces the issues to those
less troublesome, then disposes of these by conclusory
statements. Issues of law are never adjudicated - just disposed
of. At page 3 elimination of issues came firstt

           Of the numerous allegations contained in Mount's
           various court submissions, we deoline to address
           those raised for the first time on appeal, as
           well as those raised below but not argued here.
           What remain are challenges to the following! (1)
           an alleged variance between the charge in the
           indictment and the government's proof at trialt
           (2) the court's instruction that proof of guilt
           was not required as to every charged document1
           (3) the failure to explain to the jury why 122
           of l*Mt doouments priginally charged in count
           two had been struck from the indictment 1 (4)
                                   663

           the admission of fourteen documents not charged
           in the indictmentt and (5) the exclusion of two
           letters of James Mclfeill whistler, memoranda
           from the Library of Congress, documents from the
           United States Patent Office, and copies of articles
           from a 1905 French Journal.
       An impressive list, even so. But now Judge Breyer improvises
rationalizations so that these need not be addressed either.
The Committee will recall that the attorney appointed to do
the direct appeal refused all contact with me. Judge Breyer
now finds (at k) "Mount's failure to advance these issues on
direct appeal creates other procedural barriers, however ...."
And so, after devoting page 5 to discussions of further
barriers he perceives to exist, at page 6 he finds that it is
not necessary to consider anything at alii
           Those of Mount's claims that conceivably
           implicate constitutional concerns are plainly
           without merit. And the failure to raise his other
           claims on direct appeal clearly precludes their
           consideration by way of a section 2255 motion.
           These additional claims, in any event, are also
           without substantive merit.
By slithering between Scylla and Charibdis, Judge Breyer does
nit sully himself entertaining legal issues put before his
court. They had been disposed of, neither more nor less. But
what about the needs of justice?
       For a fourth Habeas Corpus I made issue of a Supreme
Court case from 1989, published after my trial before Judge
Zobel. By Schmucfc vT United States that high court taught
"that a defendant cannot be held to answer a charge not
                                664

contained in th« indictment brought against him", nils
seemed to address directly one of the principle evils of
trial before Judge Zobel. I had been indicted for "Transportation
of goods knowing them to hare been stolen", and at trial in
every instance the government witnesses gave evidence to
theft. Judge Zobel wrote on the face of the motioni

            Denied. Since the Jury was not instructed as to
            an unindlcted offense, Schmuck v. P.S. is
            inapposite.
But the issue was not what the jury was charged. The issue
was that the government had set out to prove a charge "not
contained in the indictment brought against him". The Circuit
Court affirmed her denial employing unique method typical of
Judge Breyer, whom continued his practice of not soiling
himself by discussion of Issues. Though I had brought this
Habeas Corpus to show that the actions of the district court
defied the lesson of the Supreme Court, Judge Breyer makes
no mention of the Supreme Court. Under date of April 1*,
1992, he nimbly combined this proceeding with another for
change of venue, leaving the Supreme Court ruling unconsidered.
His second paragraph disposes of the mattert

                   Appellee (the government) has moved under
           Loc. R. 27.1 for summary disposition in No. 91-
           2200, arguing that the sole issue there raised
           has previously been considered and rejected by
           this court in one of petitioner's earlier habeas
           appeals. We agree. See Mount y, United States.
           No. 90-196*, slip op. at 6-7 (1st Clr. June 28,
           1991). Nothing contained in petitioner's
           submissions calls our conclusion there into
           question.
                                   665

       Side-stepping the Supreme Court has resulted in very
bad law. For this was a Supreme Court lesson taught since
the conriction, and in Davis vT United States. atlj6, Mr.
Justice Stewart showedi "intervening change in the law"
eliminates all possible bar to Habeas Corpus. We begin to
comprehemd that Judge Breyer never would heed any Supreme
Court ruling that interfered with his basic mission to
cover-up what had happened in the court of Judge Zobel.

       In the same opinion of the Supreme Court (Davia)
Justice Stewart had shown "that relief in 28 U.S.C. section
2255 cannot be denied as to constitutional claims solely on
ground that relief should have been sought by appeal". Had
Judge Breyer heeded that ruling he must have reversed his
own opinion of June 28, 1991, in which he wrote "Mount's
failure to advance these issues on direct appeal creates
other procedural barriers ...." That had been untrue. We
see emerging a special, eccentric view of law, which in no
particular corresponds with the law of the United States.
This is Breyer's Law. And it much encouraged the wanton and
reckless nature of Judge Zobel's acts.

       Sixth and seventh Habeas Corpus petitions submitted to
the district court now received no consideration at all. Judge
Zobel wrote DENIED on the lower left corner of each face
sheet. Notoriously unaccountable on the bench, she had a
projector in Chi*/ Judge Breyer of the Appeals Court. This
                                666

was a conspiracy of two to float th« law of the United
States. Judge Zobel's proceedings passed without criticise,
noaatter how wild. An added grace was that the appeals of
her cases are almost never published.

       Row Imprisoned four years, for all these reasons in the
late spring of 1992 I made effort to free myself from the
reprehensible jurisdiction of this twosome. Administration
of the district court was shocked June 17. 1992, by arriral of
my eighth Habeas Corpus, and the next day by Affidavit of Bias
pursuant to Hallidav T . United States. 380 P.2d 270 (1st
Circuit. 1967). Court administration rasped to a halt. No
assignment was made. The same frozen malaise seised the
Circuit Court where Judge Breyer had erected cordon sanitaire
around Judge Zobel. Por a year past her cases had been banned
from publication. When unaccountably United States v. Grant
(September 26, 1991) 956 P.2d 1, slipped through into paperback
edition of Pederal Reporter, revealing that again Judge Zobel
had convicted a defendant of whom it was found "legally
impossible for defendant to commit the crime charged" (!),
quickly this was withdrawn from hard cover edition.

       Aware that Judge Zobel menaced their viability as tribunals,
together the district court and the Pirst Circuit Instituted
a policy to limit the numbers of certiorari petitions I
could forward to the Supreme Court. Cooperative effort was
made to group submissions into single negative Orders. The
22nd day of April, 1992, Judge Zobel therefore denied six (6)
                                   667

matters gathered together in her court over a period of
four months. None were denials on the merits nor provided
opinion of any nature. All merely were subscribed "Denied".
Three of these matters were appealable including (a) motion
for return of $13,400 sent for filing in the district court
January 22, 1992j (b) motion pursuant to section 2255 to
vacate and set aside conviction unlawfully obtained by
constitutional violations, sent for filing February 10, 19921
and (c) another section 2255 motion sent for filing February
14, 1992.

          May 4, 1992, I dispatched three appeal notices, each in
separate envelope. Only one such Notice of Appeal was forwarded
to the Circuit Court by the district court clerk. The single
briefing schedule to reach me seemed an effort to bunch
three appeals together and June 4 I sent Motion To Sever
for filing with the Circuit Court. By Order dated September 11,
1992, the Circuit Court decreed investigation of the two lost
casest

               ... under Fed R. App. P 10(c) we direct the
              district court to investigate this matter and,
              if appropriate, to reconstruct the record
              nunc pro tune.
Briefing schedules with respect to the "lost" section 2255
motions filed in February arrived without explanation in
October 1992, when I was in my fifth year of imprisonment.
                                    668

The test for judicial impropriety established by the
Supreme Court in Liljeberg y^ Health Services Acquisitions
Corp. (1988) was far exceeded, and I was without adequate
remedy. That Judge Zobel continued to commit profoundly
sociopathic acts violating the fundamental mission of the
federal courts to provide justice and protect the innocent,
was drowned in more complex pathologies of a cover-up. By
Lll.ieberg the Supreme Court found that judicial propriety
is established by a specific testi "if it would appear to
a reasonable person that a judce has knowledge of the facts
which would five him an interest in the litigation, then
an appearance of partiality is created even though no actual
partiality exists". The Supreme Court taught further that
it is appropriate to consider (1) thr risk of Injustice to the
parties in the particular case, (2) the risk that denial
of relief will produce injustice in other cases, and (3) the
risk of undermindin*: the public's confidence in the judicial
processi "a court, in making such a determination, must
continuously bear in mind that, in order to perform its
function in the best way, justice must satisfy the appearance
of justice".

       Yet here, knowingly, wantonly and deliberately, the
district court and the Pirst Circuit carried on the most
                                   669

shameful cover-up of a railroading. Proceedings disappeared
or were not assigned for adjudication. Denials were without
Memorandum or Opinion. Every lesson of the Supreme Court in
this century was violated. District court and Circuit Court
were devoted to the most appalling dishonesty in support of
an aberant judge whom demonstrated absolute contempt for law.

       The partiality of Judge Zobel was grotesque and overwhelming,
The time was past due to admit the corroded environment in
which this unworthy judiciary operated by open bias and
prejudice, denial of witnesses and evidence, tampering with
evidence false charge to the jury, fatal variance, withholding
of court documents, and loss or destruction of multiple
submissions. Judge Zobel claimed the powers of a Deity to
convict any person brought before her, whether by whim or
extrajudicial bias and prejudice.

       The interests of justice and constitutional due process
cannot allow this to continue. Social costs to the First Circuit
from year after year hiding intolerable acts on part of an
unstable judiciary, all contrary to the needs of justice, are
too great. Judge Breyer exists as co-conspirator with Judge
Zobel by allowing her to imprison an eminent scholar whom had
been fully vindicated at trial. Inevitably all this must
unravel before the public. At stake then, and here today, is
the credibility of the entire federal judicial system.

   ,_, AND THBf THINGS BBCAME NASTY. Judge Breyer began to
                                  670

play a badger game, dismissing submissions with direction to
try elsewhere - and elsewhere dismissing again. October 23,
1991t a complaint to the Judicial Council had been acknowledged
by the Circuit Executive. Significant aspect of that complaint
was willful destruction by Judge Zobel before trial and
afterward of letters to the court, two petitions for writs,
and a 2255 motion. Her destructive rampage, unprecedented in
the history of the federal court system, was considered in
parallel with issues from the trial, including fatal variance,
gross extrajudicial bias and prejudice, misapplication of the
First Circuit's binding precedents, and wanton denial of the
Supreme Courts leading cases. Added to grievous constitutional
violations was more recent discovery that Judge Zobel also
had destroyed the further motion pursuant to 2255 submitted
the 29th day of Jabuary, 1991. All was done in evident belief
that protection given her by Judge Breyer rendered her acts
impervious to discovery.

       She was correct. Even when these matters were put before
the Judicial Counsel the adjudication entered August 21, 1992,
was written by Stephen G. Breyer. Delicately omitting the
name of the district judge, he exulted in his own cleverness 1

                  I dismiss this complaint in part as "directly
           related to the merits of a decision or procedural
           ruling." 28 U .S .C . section 372(c)(3)( A)(ii). Insofar
           as complaint has sought, or seeks, to reverse his
           conviction, to recuse the district judge, and to
           prevent the seizure or effect the return of the
           funds and letters in question, complainants proper
                                       671

           recourse, following adverse actiob by the district
            judge, i s by way of appeal to the court of appeals.
In a letter to William R. Burchill, Jr., General Counsel of
the Judicial Council of the United States, I observedi
           In the end the matter comes down not alone to
           the ethical disgrace being perpetrated by
           District Judge Zobel and Circuit Judge Breyer,
           but question whether justice knowingly can be
           denied a defendant in the United States' Courts
           when i t becomes a certainty that no crime was
           committed. Or, alternately, whether such obsessive
           protection of a district judge whom disgraces
           her court to obtain conviction of an innocent
           person i s of equal or greater importance than
           the Federal Courts mission to provide justice.
       And s t i l l the battle by Habeas Corpus went on. Gloating
over his badger game by refaring the Judicial Council complaint
back to the Court of Appeals, Judge Breyer now wrote dismissive
denial for appeal of the ninth Habeas Corpus. It will be
recalled that at trial in Boston from a total of 167 documents
135 had been dismissed for "insufficient proof of ownership"
by the government. Also, that so large a proportion of the
allegedly "stolen" documents havirur been proved my own property
without taint, more than reasonable doubt existed any had
been stolen. This comports with the finding of the Supreme
Court by Jackson v. Virginia that evidence i s insufficient

ifi

            . . . i t is found that upon the record evidence
           adduced at trial no rational trier of fact
           could have found proof of guilt beyond a
           reasonable doubt in terms of the substantive
           elements of the criminal offense . . . .
Judge Zobel of course would have nothing to do with this. She
                                   672

wrote on the face paget

              Denied, judgement may be entered dismissing
              the claim.

         Consistent in his own way. Judge Breyer, whom wrote

the Opinion of the Court of Appeals, never touched on the

issue. I quote his entire twelve linest

              In this most recent challenge to his 1988
              conviction for interstate transportation of
              stolen property (one of a series of such
              challenges he has brought pursuant to 28 U .S .C.
              section 2255), petitioner alleges that the
              evidence was insufficient to support the jury's
              finding of guilt. In particular, he contends that
              the testimony of two government witnesses was
              unworthy of credence. In our decision on direct
              appeal. we discussed such testimony at some length
              and found that the jury was justified in relying
              thereon. See United States v. Mount. 896 P.2d 612,
              616-20 (lsf~C*ir. 1990). fhe arguments now advanced
              by petitioner, even if not procedurally barred,
              provide no basis for revisiting this issue.

But the "arguments now advanced by petitioner" were the

lesson of the United States Supreme Court, again discarded

in favor of Breyer's Law. And of course this evasion was held

in complete secrecy by being marked NOT FOR PUBLICATION. No

one must ever know to what depths Judge Breyer sank by

continuously disallowing the findings of the Supreme Court.

My Habeas Corpus motions numbered 8,9 and 10, dated June 14,

1992, August 3, 1992, and December 2, 1992, were each submitted

to the district court with AFFIDAVIT OF BIAS pursuant to

Hallidav v. United States, a First Circuit case from 1967

reported at 380 F.2d 270. Of this case the Harvard Law Review,

Volume 63, at pages 1207-1208, wrote 1
                                  673

           The Court o' Appeals for the First Circuit has
           held that a judge other than the trial Judge should
           rule on the 2255 motion ... There is a procedure
           by which the movant can have a judge other than
           the trial judge decide his motion in courts adhering
           to the majority rule. He can file an affidavit
           alleging bias in order to disqualify the trial
           judge
This is precisely what I did for these three 2255 motions.
Nevertheless Judge Zobel seized and denied them without opinion
or reference to the merits. Each denial by Judge Zobel was
then affirmed, in the manner of a rubber stamp, by the Circuit
Court presided over by Judge Breyer. Nowhere had the merits
been consideredi no one examined on what basis I languished
wrongfully in prison year after year. An appalling situation
continued to worsen.

Then, early in January 1993 this country had a new President.
Young, curious, interesting himself in every aspect of
government, his first task was to select a Cabinet. Judge
Zobel thereupon contracted the notion that as a German woman,
born at Zwickau, Germany, December 18, 1931, a Jew and a
holocaust survivor, she must be made Attorney General of the
United States in the new administration of President William
J. Clinton. Her candidacy was considered by this President
most anxious to explore every avenue, and eventually she
arrived in her little hat for interview at the White House.
                                   674

By sending the President copy of a mandamus petition recently
filed with the First Circuit, naming Judge Zobel as respondent
and demonstrating a broad spectrum of improprieties, contribution
was made to the defeat of her unseemly ambition.

       Worse then arose when in his turn, in that year 1993 Hon.
Stephen G. Breyer felt that the new President must nominate
him to the United States Supreme Court. June 3, 1993, I wrote
a letter to Judge Breyer himself one paragraph of which saidi

                   Appeal of eleven section 2255 motions have
           reached the First Circuit, plus a bevy of petitions
            for mandamus, recusal, and change of venue, and
           a suit for damages from Judge Zobel's thefts of
           $18,400 cash and the 135 historical documents
           dismissed from the indictment at trial. Like my
            funds, the documents have not been returned to
           me. In each instance you defied established law
           to protect a woman whom lomg ago must have been
           removed from the bench. Most recently, in No. 92-
            1576, you even refused to examine the two pages
           of transcripts enclosed herein, showing dismissal
           at trial of the 135 historical documents. On
           petition for rehearing to which the same transcripts
           were annexed, once more you refused to examine
           them.
The letter honorably dispatched to Judge Breyer himself, in
the same mail copy went to President Clinton.
       Original letter to Judge Breyer and copy to the President
seem to have been delivered Monday, June 7, 1993. The reaction
of Judge Breyer was spectacular. The following day, June 8,
1993, he gathered together three of my cases on appeal before
the First Circuit and denied them in a single Order showing
no cause. A district judge at Boston, Hon. Joseph L. Tauro,
then* also weighed in with a dismissal. I sent Judge Breyer*a
                                   675

very unusual triple dismissal to the President. One paragraph
of ay coraring letter saidt

            Question arises whether a federal judge so petty,
           unprincipled, and filled with naked vindictiveness,
           who retaliates by violation of all civilised
           standards and standards of jurisprudence, can be
           fit to sit on the Supreme Court.
President Clinton abandoned the candidacy of Stephen G.
Breyer and nominated to the Supreme Court Hon. Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.
       As we hare seen by his Orders, Judge Breyer treats
substantial matters of law solely as avenues for expression
of a puerile cleverness and a pervasive personal egotism.
By uts corresponding contempt for the proper functions of a
Court of Appeals, the First Circuit under his guidance
leaves vast constitutional infirmities unconnected. Direct
test of this followed again, July 1, 1993. when the First
Circuit received from me a petition for writ of mandamus which
called attention to gross violation of Article III, Section
2, of the Constitution, as well as the Sixth Amendment.
       The indicated portion of the Constitution saysi
           The Trial of all Crimes, except in cases of
           Impeachment, shall be by Juryi and such Trial
           shall be held in the State where the said
           Crime shall have been committed ....
How then was I tried at Boston with the government producing
squads of witnesses whom gave evidence to "theft" in
Washington? For this single violation to hit two.governing
expressions of the Constitution is remarkable in an extreme.
                                   676

The enormous gravity of the wrong committed is well demonstrated,
The Sixth Amendment sayst

           In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
           enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,
           by an impartial jury of the State and district
           wherein the crime shall have been committed,
           which district shall have been previously
           ascertained by law ....
       In sipler words, to have put me on trial at Boston and
allowed exhaustive testimony that I had "stolen" documents
from the Library of Congress at Washington, was constitutionally
barred. And it is typical of proceedings conducted at Boston
that it was done anyhow. One wondered how could Judge Breyer
evade this direct challenge to unconstitutional law, of the
sort he always affirmed by sidestepping the issue. The answer
was not lomg in coming. Within fifteen days from its arrival
in Boston, hardly time enough for the Appeals Court to docket
and review the petition, it also had determined to dismiss,
and to do so not on the merits. The Order of Court entered
July 15. 1993t was seven words onlyt
           The petition for writ of mandamus is denied.
       This is barbarous treatment and gross impropriety on part
of a Circuit Court with duty to supervise proceedings in its
district courts. Here a district judge in Massachusetts had
the presumption to try a defendant alleged to have committed
a theft in the City of Washington* District of Columbia,
wherever one looked, whether to Article III, Section 2, of
the Constitution, the Sixth Amendment, or even Role 18,
                                677

Federal Rules of Criminal Proceedings, no jurisdiction for
such a trial existed at Boston.

       The district court had exceeded authority, jurisdiction,
and powers, and for the First Circuit Judge Breyer merely
looked away. Were there any principle orprivilege which would
hare supported the action of the district court, or rendered
it even quasi-legal, this must have been stated. Instead the
Circuit Court dismissed not on the merits, leaving gross
constitutional infirmity and a state of legal quagmire. An
unlawful act was neither justified nor condemned, an innocent
scholar left imprisoned without cause.

       Examining the situstion left by this insolubrious
disposition, one sees forthwith that to have imprisoned me
without the commission of any crime, but merely on clandestine
whisperings of unstable librarians who know nothing of me or
my affairs, is a crime against humanity. That I should have been
imprisoned by a Boston court that denied me all indigent
subpoenas, denied me documentary evidence, and held trial in
violation of the absolute bar found in Article III, Section 2,
of the Constitution, is too heinous to be properly described.
That this man, the Chief Judge of the First Circuit Court of
Appeals, should wrongfully have kept me in prison year after
year, for six years, never bothering to examine my endless
submissions showing so many judicial irregularities, beggars
description.

       To say that Judge Breyer is like Shakespeare's Iago,
                                 678

 who believed in a cruel Gcd, would not bt correct. Judge
 Breyer belives that he himself has immutable right to inflict
 cruelty on those before his court. His bias and prejudice can
be activated by rumor, frivolous gossip, or the schemes of
 unstable individuals. He enjoys displaying a superficial
 cleverness, but lacks the incisive intelligence that would
distinguish extrajudicial gossip from evidence. Willingly and
obtusely and with singleness of purpose he denies justice,
denies all law, all precedents, all statute. The Constitution
 itself is nothing to him when for whatever private motive he
desires to inflict cruelty. He has been called "smug" and
"arrogant", and if the media can be trusted, these were
President Clinton's original perceptions. So far as they go
they are correct. But the reality is that Stephen G. Breyer
practices the prerogatives otherwise reserved for God.

       He is without human compassion. He taunts and torments
with persistent ridicule persons whom he knows to be wrongfully
imprisoned, exulting in what he believes to be his own cleverness
while they suffer the pain of the Damned. Especially in this
age when humanitarian concerns have become an essential element
of legal consideration, and the lessons of the Supreme Court
show regard for persons in every social range, this man whom
is concerned only for himself lacks fundamental qualification.
It is a maxim of law, and employed by the Supreme Court in
XllJeberg (at 875)* that "to perform its M g h function in the
best way 'justice must satisfy the appearance of justice'".
                                   679

Contrarily Judge Breyer, as we have seen here, deals out
injustice couched in a cute cleverness, and hides it under
NOT FOR PUBLICATION restriction.

       Finally, we hear that he is a builder of "consensus" and
this must be examined for whether it is a force for good or
evil. In every opinion quoted here, even the most cleverly
malign denying basic holdings of the Constitution and the
Supreme Court, he has convinced two other judges of the First
Circuit at Boston to go along. This is not a form of consensus
that would be solubrious on the Supreme Court, for we must
recall that "The Devil can quote scripture".

       The Breyer nomination, in short, presents a Pandora's
Box of courtroom cliches, myths and stereotypes - the ruthlessly
ambitious judge who sees a railroading and again and again
affirms it. These are issues never addressed in polite company,
but I have come here today to expose them. The plain issue
before this Committee is whether it can confirm to the Supreme
Court a man to whom JUSTICE is an irrelevancej the Constitution
something that does not matter.

       This man is a threat to the public, to the common good,
and to the liberties of every person. What happened to me can
happen to any one of you. Were Stephen G. Breyer confirmed
to the Supreme Court it would mark the end of liberty in this
country. I ask each of you, and I be* and pray, that you
decline to confirm Stephen G. Breyer.

                                                      THANK YOU.

                           thank you for the opportunity to submit
  this testimony about the nomination of the Honorable Judge
  Stephen Breyor to be Justice o£ the Supreme Court of United
  States of America.

                           My husband, Joseph Hampel and I would want
  this testimony circulated to the members of the Judiciary
  Committee and made part of the official record of Judge
  Breyer'a hearing* We will follow the hearings in the news

                         Again, thank you for allowing us to be part of

                 This testimony Is to address the record of the Honor-
able Judge Stephen Breyer as judge and chief Judge of the first
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston* Massachusetts. Judge Breyer
took an oath* a solemn promise* to defend the Constitution of
United states of America, but he failed to support individual
and civil, human rights for women sad people traditionally denied
equal proteotion and due process of the fourteenth Amendment.
                                   681

                A brief assessment of Judge Breyer*s work finds he was
personally informed that people of Puerto Rico were being sub-
jected to experimental nuetron-electronle- magnetlo radiation in
spying operations by intelligence gathering agencies of United
States Government* operations whloh damage environmental concerns
and injure human beings and other living organisms used as test
victims. Judge Breyer did not stop this illegal aotivity which
has absolutely no Justification* whatsoever! in law, although he
and the Appeals Court for the first Circuit were asked many times
to issue an injunction*

                Judge Breyer was personally Informed that Amerioan
oitisens were subjected to unoonscionable abuse in actions by
Government in the case* H1MPEL vs« AUTORIDAD* which has been in
litigation since 1988, ooastantlr beset by lies* deceit* fraud,
such as conspriraey In the instant case to dismiss the ease be-
fore the mala defendant had answered and while plaintiffs were
complaining about Judge Breyer In Washington, D» 0*

                 Judge Breyer was personally advised through the
executive official of the Judlolal Council of the Appeals Court
about the mental disability and erratic behavior of sonr- ->' tv.i
Judges on the Puerto Riean District ^Jourt* Judge Breyer wa»
sent over a hundred -ages of evldenoe doouaents relating to the
official judicial misconduct of court olerks, Juan Masinl Soler
and Lydla Pelegrin, misconduct wreaking devastating effecte of pain,
anguish* injury and torture for Joseph and Vatalya Tamara Hampell

                 There was no compassion, no understanding, no relief,
no protection of the citlsenry, not even a humanitarian break in
the horrorI Judge Breyer did nothing but berate the plaintiffs
for their persistence in bringing the complaints to the Courts*

                 Judge Breyer failed to properly adhere to the
Constitution of United States In the administration of his duties
in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, Massachusetts.
