NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                              TUESDAY, JULY 20, 1993

                                                               U.S. SENATE,
                                            COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in room
216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Thurmond,
Simpson, Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen, and Pressler.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order, please.
  Judge Ginsburg, welcome.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. And, believe me, you are welcome here this
morning. As I said to you a few moments ago, riding down on the
train this morning I had my usual stack of newspapers. I will not
name them all for fear of getting in trouble, but one that I had,
beyond the Wilmington News Journal, which is the most important
paper in America, was the New York Times. And I looked at page
1, and there was no comment about this hearing. I looked at page
2, and there was no comment, and page 3. And I literally thought
I had picked up yesterday's edition.
  Then, as they say, my heart sank when I realized it was page
8 or 10 or 12, which was the most wonderful thing that has hap-
pened to me since I have been chairman of this committee: that a
major hearing warranted the 8th or 9th or 10th page because thus
far it has generated so little controversy. So you are welcome.
  But the real purpose of today's hearing is to welcome back Arlen
Specter. Arlen, welcome. It is so good to have you back. It really
is.
  [Applause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I am one of the few people who can understand
why he is wearing that hat. When I had a similar operation, Sen-
ator, former President Reagan wrote me a letter saying, "Dear
Joe"--and he had had the operation he had had on his skull some-
what earlier, and he said, "Dear Joe: Welcome to the Cracked Head
Club."
  Well, welcome, Arlen. I hope you wear it well. Welcome back.

                                               (1)
  Senator SPECTER. I very much appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I
thought that, being a Senator, I had been a member of that club
for some time. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. NO. YOU have been a member of a different--I
won't characterize what the club is you are a member of. Welcome
back.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BIDEN

  The CHAIRMAN. On a more serious note, today the Senate Judici-
ary Committee welcomes Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Presi-
dent's nominee to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  This is a very familiar setting for us. Since I became chairman
of this committee 7 years ago, we have now convened hearings on
five nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court.

  The Constitution states clearly that the President "shall nomi-
nate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall
appoint * * * judges of the Supreme Court." Clearly the appoint-
ment of a Supreme Court Justice is not a Presidential prerogative.
The Senate is an equal partner in the process and has significant
obligations attendant to its responsibilities. These confirmation
hearings are a major part, though not the only part, of the process
by which we attempt to fulfill our constitutional responsibility.

  The nomination of a Supreme Court Justice signals the renewal
of a national debate over the meaning of our Constitution--a de-
bate, I might add, that has been going on for over 200 years, with-
out end, and that will go on for another 200 years, I suspect.

  How will the broad principles embodied in the Constitution--
phrases like due process, equal protection, rights retained by the
people--how will these and other ennobling phrases in the Con-
stitution be applied to the realities of everyday life? That is the
issue which we have been debating and will continue to debate.

  Profound questions with practical implications have and will con-
tinue to confront us, as the judge only knows too well, questions
such as:

  Does religious freedom mean that Jewish-American soldiers can-
not wear a yarmulke while on duty despite Army prohibition?
Which, obviously, they can now, with certainty.

  Does liberty mean that each of us can decide, without the Gov-
ernment deciding for us, whom we shall marry, whether we shall
marry, where we will live, or whether to have children or choose
not to have children?

  Does the right to own property mean that the Government may
not, without compensation, prohibit a property owner from pollut-
ing the stream that flows through his or her land?

  These and hundreds of other thorny issues have no easy an-
swers. There are not even any right answers in the usual sense of
that word, but there are valid and varied constitutional approaches
to answering them, applied over the last 200 years by Justices on
the Court. The constitutional answers to such questions flow from
the interpretive method judges apply to cases that come before
them.

  Over the more than two centuries in which our constitutional de-
mocracy has endured, our understanding of individual freedom has
expanded. This trend is not new. The expansion of notions of lib-
erty and equality began with the birth of this Republic.

  Our understanding of the Constitution has not been static; rath-
er, it has flowed consistently in the direction of broadening the
freedom that Americans have as individuals.

  The document has remained, as its writers intended, in my view,
a flexible and dynamic instrument. Throughout our history, each
evolutionary change, though, has brought controversy. Each expan-
sion of individual liberty has ignited resistance from those who pre-
fer the status quo. But in every instance, moving ahead on liberty
has proved to be the right thing to do.

  Removing the barriers of race to full equality generated enough
conflict in the 19th century to fuel a bitter and bloody civil war,
and resistance has been carried on into our own time. But today
it is generally acknowledged, even where it was once most resisted,
that reducing the barriers of race has strengthened American soci-
ety.

  The granting of more equal rights under the Constitution to
women, a change that owes much to the lawyer who is our nominee
today, has been similarly controversial. But today, with that proc-
ess not yet complete, most Americans agree that it has been a
change for the better in the life of this society.

  The Voting Rights Act, which has extended the practical right to
vote to millions of formerly disenfranchised Americans, was and re-
mains a source of controversy, even on the Supreme Court itself.
But today there are hundreds of minority women and men holding
public office where formerly there were few, even in areas where
majority voters dominate the rolls, the entire process bringing us
closer to the constitutional goal of representative government.

  The controversy that flows inevitably from change has found its
way into these hearings in the past, into the confirmation process
in the past decade-and-a-half. But it does not alter in any sense
what we plan on doing here today.

  Our task today, as in all Supreme Court confirmation hearings,
is to consider the character and qualities and the judicial philoso-
phy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

  Judge Ginsburg comes before the committee with her place al-
ready secured in history. In the 1970's, Judge, you argued a series
of landmark cases that changed the way our laws could distinguish
legally between women and men, and you have significantly nar-
rowed the circumstances under which distinctions among Ameri-
cans may be made. You have already helped to change the meaning
of equality in our Nation.

  Now, as you face a new opportunity to help shape the future of
America, we welcome you, and we invite you--and I personally in-
vite you, Judge, to share with us and the American people your vi-
sion of the shape of the future of America.

  [The prepared statement of Chairman Biden follows:]

                                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BIDEN

  Today, the Judiciary Committee welcomes Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Presi-
dent's nominee to be Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

  This is a familiar setting for us--since I became chairman of the committee seven
years ago, we have now convened hearings on five nominees to the Supreme Court.
  And these confirmation hearings are a major part though not the only part, of the
process by which we attempt to fulfill that constitutional duty.

  The nomination of a Supreme Court Justice signals the renewal of a national de-
bate over the meaning of our constitution:

  How will the broad principles embodied in the constitution--phrases like "due
process," "equal protection" and "rights retained by the people"--be applied to the
realities of everyday life?

  Profound questions with practical implications have and will continue to confront
us:

  Does religious freedom mean that a Jewish American soldier cannot wear a
yarmulke while on duty despite an army prohibition?

  Does "liberty" mean that each of us can decide--without the government deciding
for us--whom to marry, where to live, or whether to have children or use contracep-
tives to avoid having them?

  Does the right to own property mean that the government may not, without com-
pensation, prohibit a property owner from polluting a stream that flows through his
or her land?

  There are no easy answers to such questions--there are not even any "right" an-
swers in the usual sense of the word; but there are valid and varied constitutional
approaches to answering them, and the constitutional answers to such questions
flow from the interpretive method justices apply to cases that come before them.

  Over the more than two centuries in which our constitutional democracy has en-
dured, our understanding of individual freedom has expanded.

  This trend is not new: the expansion of notions of liberty and equality began with
the birth of the republic.

  Our understanding of the constitution has not been static; rather it has flowed
consistently in the direction of broadening the freeedoms of Americans.

  The document has remained, as its writers intended, a flexible and dynamic in-
strument.

  Throughout our history, each evolutionary change has brought controversy; each
expansion of individual liberty has ignited resistance from those who prefer the sta-
tus quo--but in every instance, moving ahead on liberty has proved to be the right
thing to do:

  Removing the barrier of race to full equality generated enough conflict in the 19th
century to fuel a bitter and bloody civil war, and resistance has been carried into
our own time.

  But today it is generally acknowledged, even where it was once most resisted,
that reducing the barriers of race has strengthened American society.

  The granting of more equal rights under the constitution to women--a change
that owes much to the lawyer who is our nonimee today--has been similarly con-
troversial.

  But today, with that process not yet complete, most Americans agree that it has
been a change for the better in the life of our nation.

  The voting rights act, which has extended the practical right to vote to millions
of formerly disenfranchised Americans, was and remains a source of controversy,
even on the Supreme Court itself; but today there are hundreds of minority women
and men holding public office where formerly there were few--even in areas where
majority voters dominate the rolls--bringing us closer to the constitutional goal of
representative government.

  The controversy that flows inevitably from change has found its way into the con-
firmation process. But it does not alter in any sense what we do here.

  Our task today--as in all Supreme Court confirmation hearings--is to consider
the character, the qualities and the judicial philosophy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

  Judge Ginsburg, you come before the committee with your place in history already
secure.

  In the 1970's you argued a series of landmark cases that changed the way our
laws could distinguish between men and women.

  You have already helped to change the meaning of equality in our nation.
  Now, as you face a new opportunity to help shape the future of America, we wel-
come you and we invite you to share with us and the American people your vision
of the shape of that future.

  The CHAIRMAN. I yield now to my colleague, Senator Hatch, the
ranking member, who I would also like to publicly thank for expe-
diting this process. As all of my colleagues know, if any of the
members in this committee, and particularly the ranking member,
concluded that it was not appropriate to move as rapidly as we
have, under the Senate rules that could easily be done. It could be
slowed. The Senator has been totally and completely cooperative
from the outset. He has been a man of his word in suggesting that
he would move where there was no controversy from his perspec-
tive, would move judiciously, warning me that there may be future
occasions when he might not be ready to be so cooperative. But I
thank him for his cooperation, and I appreciate it very much.

  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Senator Biden, for your kind
words, and welcome, Judge Ginsburg, to the committee. We are
very happy and pleased to have you here and to finally have these
proceedings start.

  I want to personally pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Spec-
ter. We are happy to have him back and happy to have him in such
good health and good condition. I do think he could have gotten a
little better Pennsylvania hat than that one myself.

  The CHAIRMAN. And I wish you would fold the brim a little bit,
Arlen.

  Senator HATCH. At least curve the brim, Arlen. [Laughter.]
            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HATCH

  Senator HATCH. Well, I want to congratulate you, Judge Gins-
burg, for this wonderful opportunity to be Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. You have had a distinguished career in the law.
You have been a law professor and pioneering advocate for equal
rights for women, and for over 13 years, you have served as a
thoughtful member of the Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit.

  You have been nominated to replace a really fine member of the
Court, a distinguished public servant and patriot, Justice Byron
White, a person I have had a personal, strong friendship and rela-
tionship with, who I think is a great Justice. And I pay him tribute
and wish him well as he enters into a well-deserved retirement.

  Judge Ginsburg's ability, character, intellect, and temperament
to serve on the Supreme Court are not, in my mind, in question.
I don't have any doubts at all about that. I have been favorably im-
pressed with Judge Ginsburg for some time.

  A Supreme Court Justice, in my view, however, must meet an
additional qualification. He or she must understand the role of the
judiciary, including the Supreme Court, in our system of govern-
ment. Under our system, a Supreme Court Justice should interpret
the law and not legislate his or her own policy preferences from the
bench. The role of the judicial branch is to enforce the provisions
of the Constitution and the laws we enact in Congress as their
meaning was originally intended by the Framers.

  Any other philosophy of judging requires unelected Federal
judges to impose their own personal views on the American people
in the guise of construing the Constitution and Federal statutes.
There is no way around this conclusion. Such an approach is judi-
cial activism, plain and simple. And it is wrong, whether it comes
from the political left or whether it comes from the political right.

  Let there be no mistake: The Constitution, in its original mean-
ing, can be readily applied to changing circumstances. That tele-
phones did not exist in 1791, for example, does not mean that the
fourth amendment's ban on unreasonable searches is inapplicable
to a person's use of the telephone. But while circumstances may
change, the meaning--the principle--of the text, which applies to
those new circumstances, does not change.

  Reasonable jurists can sometimes disagree over what a particu-
lar constitutional or statutory provision was intended to mean and
over how such meaning is properly applied to a given set of facts.
But if the judicial branch is not governed by a jurisprudence of
original meaning, the judiciary usurps the role the Constitution re-
serves to the people through their elected representatives.

  When judges depart from those principles of construction, they
elevate themselves not only over the executive and legislative
branches, but over the Constitution itself and, of course, over the
American people. These judicial activists, whether of the left or
right, undemocratically exercise a power of governance that the
Constitution commits to the people and their elected representa-
tives. And these judicial activists are limited, as Alexander Hamil-
ton shrewdly recognized over 200 years ago, only by their own
will--which is no limit at all.

  As a consequence of judicial activism, we witnessed in an earlier
era the invalidation of State social welfare legislation, such as
wage and hour laws. Since the advent of the Warren court, judicial
activism has resulted in the elevation of the rights of criminals and
criminal suspects and the concomitant strengthening of the crimi-
nal forces against the police forces of our country; the twisting of
the constitutional and statutory guarantees of equal protection of
the law such that reverse discrimination often results; prayer being
chased out of the schools; and the Court's creating out of thin air
a constitutional right to abortion on demand, to just cite a few in-
stances and a few examples. One of the objectives of the judicial
activists for the future is the elimination of the death penalty.

  The Constitution, as it has been amended through the years, in
its original meaning, is our proper guide on all of these issues. It
places primary responsibility in the people to govern themselves. It
provides means of amendment through the agency of the people
and their elected representatives, not by a majority of the Supreme
Court. That is why appointing and confirming judges and Supreme
Court Justices who won't let their own personal policy preferences
sway their judgment is so important.

  A President is entitled to some deference in a selection of a Su-
preme Court Justice. President Clinton and I are unlikely to agree
on the person who ought to be nominated. But so long as the nomi-
nee is experienced in the law, intelligent, of good character and
temperament, and gives clear and convincing evidence of under-
standing the proper role of the judiciary in our system of govern-
ment, I can support that nomination and that nominee.

  Moreover, I do not expect to agree with any nominee, especially
one chosen by a President of the other party, on every issue before
the judicial branch. The key question is whether the nominee can
put aside his or her own policy preferences and interpret the Con-
stitution and the laws in a neutral fashion.

  Finally, I would point out that I disagree very much with some
of Judge Ginsburg's academic writings and some views she held
prior to ascending to the bench in 1980. I believe that Judge Gins-
burg's judicial opinions, however, indicate her understanding that
her policy views and earlier role as advocate are distinct from her
role as a judge. I will explore that distinction in these hearings.

  It is my hope that Judge Ginsburg will satisfy this committee
that she shares the judicial philosophy of applying the original
meaning of our Constitution and laws in the cases which come be-
fore her on the Supreme Court, if she is confirmed.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch follows:]

                                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR HATCH

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I congratulate the nominee, Judge Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, on her nomination to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Judge Gins-
burg has had a distinguished career in the law. She has been a law professor and
pioneering advocate for equal opportunity for women. For over 13 years, she has
served as a thoughtful member of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

tended by their framers.

tion and federal statutes. There is no way around this conclusion. Such an approach
is judicial activism, plain and simple. And it is wrong, whether it comes from the
political left or the right.

   Let there be no mistake: the Constitution, in its original meaning, can readily be
applied to changing circumstances. That telephones did not exist in 1791, for exam-
ple, does not mean that the fourth amendment's ban on unreasonable searches is
inapplicable to a person's use of the telephone. But, while circumstances may
change, the meaning--the principle--of the text, which applies to those new cir-
cumstances, does not change.

   Reasonable jurists can sometimes disagree over what a particular Constitutional
or statutory provision was intended to mean and over how such meaning is properly
applied to a given set of facts. But, if the judicial branch is not governed by a juris-
prudence of original meaning, the judiciary usurps the role the Constitution re-
serves to the people through their elected representatives.

  Alexander Hamilton, an advocate of a vigorous central government, in defending
the judiciary's right to review and invalidate the Legislative Branch's acts which
contravene the Constitution, made clear that federal judges are not to be guided by
personal predilection. He rejected the concern that such judicial review made the
judiciary superior to the legislature: "A constitution, is, in fact, and must be re-
garded by the judges as, a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascer-
tain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the
legislative body * * *. It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense
of a repugnancy [between a legislative enactment and the Constitution], may sub-
stitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. The
courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise
will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their
pleasure to that of the legislature body. [This] observation * * * would prove that
there ought to be no judges distinct from that body." (Federalist 78.) And this com-
mingling of the legislative and judicial functions, of course, would tend to start us
down the road to the kind of tyranny the Framers warned about when the separate
executive, legislative, and judicial functions are united in the same hands.

  When judges depart from these principles of construction, they elevate themselves
not only over the executive and legislative branches, but over the Constitution itself,
and, of course, over the American people. These judicial activists, whether of the left
or right, undemocratically exercise a power of governance that the Constitution com-
                                           8

mits to the people and their elected representatives. And these judicial activists are
limited, as Alexander Hamilton shrewdly recognized over 200 years ago, only by
their own will--which is no limit at all.

  As a consequence of judicial activism, we witnessed, in an earlier era, the invali-
dation of state social welfare legislation, such as wage and hour laws. Since the ad-
vent of the Warren Court, judicial activism has resulted in the elevation of the
rights of criminals and criminal suspects and the concomitant strengthening of the
criminal forces against the police forces of our country; the twisting of constitutional

nation often results; prayer being chased out of the schools; and, the Court's creat-
ing out of thin air a constitutional right to abortion on demand to cite a few exam-
ples. One of the objectives of the judicial activists for the future is the elimination

laws in the cases which will come before her on the Supreme Court if she is con-
firmed.

  Senator HATCH. NOW, Mr. Chairman, I want to say that I am
pleased with this nomination. I am looking forward to these hear-
ings. They are important. This is one of the great constitutional ex-
ercises, and I think every Senator here will be asking some very
interesting questions. But could I ask for a few more minutes just
as a personal privilege?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. I want to thank the chairman, and I appreciate
the indulgence of my colleagues and the nominee.

  I believe my colleagues will agree with me that two members of
this committee deserve special recognition for their service on this
committee and in the Senate. The distinguished Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has been a member of the Judiciary
Committee since February 13, 1963--30 years, 5 months, and 1
week of service. This service included 2 years as chairman. I do not
mean to age the Senator from Massachusetts, but his service on
the committee began so long ago I had to ask the Senate Historical
Office to look it up.

  Fortunately, they did not have to go back as far as the Jurassic
period, although he does tend to dwell in that period from time to
time. [Laughter.]

  Nineteen Supreme Court nominations have occurred during this
time. Of course, we all know that Senator Kennedy has continued
a long and distinguished family tradition of public service. Many
Americans have gotten involved in public service as a result of the
example of the Kennedy family.

  But I might add for other history buffs that Senator William E.
Borah of Idaho, during his 31 years on this committee from 1909
to 1940, witnessed 22 Supreme Court nominations, a record which
Senator Kennedy is now approaching. The Senator from Massachu-
setts, however, is a mere youngster next to our distinguished col-
league, the senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond,
chairman of this committee for 6 years.

  I was interested to learn from the Senate Historical Office that
Senator Thurmond's service on the committee began after that of
Senator Kennedy, on January 16, 1967. Thus, Senator Thurmond
has not sat on the committee for as many Supreme Court nomina-
tions as Senator Kennedy. He missed the Abe Fortas nomination
in committee in 1965, although, as we all know, he was on the com-
mittee for Justice Fortas' unsuccessful nomination to be Chief Jus-
tice.

  But Senator Thurmond has been a Member of the Senate longer
than any other current Member. He has witnessed 25 nominations
as a Senator, beginning with President Eisenhower's nomination of
John M. Harlan in January 1955. No other current Member of the
Senate has been here for as many Supreme Court nominations.
Through nine Presidents, all but one of whom, Jimmy Carter, sent
nominees to the Senate, and as Supreme Court nominees and Su-
preme Court Justices have come and gone, Senator Thurmond has
been at his post.

  Amazingly, I discovered that Senator Thurmond does not hold
the Senate record--not yet, anyway. Senator Carl Hayden of Ari-
zona, during his 42 years of Senate service, witnessed 28 Supreme
Court nominations. Does anyone doubt that that record one day
will fall to South Carolina?

  Earlier this year, I observed that my friend from South Carolina
is a Senator's Senator, a tenacious advocate for the people of his
State, the best interests of our country, and the principles he be-
lieves in.

  Now, let me mention something more. Senator Thurmond has
served as an inspiration to generations of young people, not just
South Carolinians, not just southerners, but young people all over
the Nation. These Americans have been spurred to participate in
the political life of their communities, their States, and their coun-
try by the example of Senator Thurmond's devotion to limited gov-
ernment, free enterprise, a strong national defense, and his deep,
selfless love of country. Some of those he has inspired sit behind
me. Others he has inspired, like myself, sit on this committee as
his colleague, a privilege for which I am very grateful.

  I thought both of our colleagues deserve some small recognition
for their service, and I want to thank Richard A. Baker, the Sen-
ate's Historian, and Joanne McCormick Quatannens of his office for
their timely help in compiling the details of the service of our two
colleagues. And I want to thank my colleagues for this courtesy so
I could make these remarks and pay tribute to these two colleagues
here today.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                       10

  The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank you, Senator. You have just
solved a mystery for me. I wondered why Senator Thurmond spent
so much time on the floor talking about Abe Fortas. Now I know.
He wasn't on the committee. He didn't have a chance to speak in
the committee.

  Now, we are going to go slightly out of order here, and the distin-
guished chairman of the Finance Committee has the unenviable job
of being the Chair of a conference committee that is just putting
together the national budget and reconciliation. He is to convene
that conference at 11. His distinguished colleague, Senator
D'Amato, representing--I am going to figure out the New York con-
nection here in a moment--is also here. So we are going to go with
the three introducers now, and then return to Senators Kennedy
and Thurmond and work our way through the committee.

  Senator Moynihan, welcome. It is a pleasure to have you here.
The floor is yours.

   STATEMENT OF HON.DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, AU.S.
             SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

  Senator MOYNIHAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch,
Senator Specter, I am privileged to introduce and to recommend
without reservation Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is especially
qualified to be the 107th Justice of the Supreme Court of the Unit-
ed States.

  Judge Ginsburg is perhaps best known as the lawyer and litiga-
tor who raised the issue of equal rights for women to the level of
constitutional principle. She has also distinguished herself in a
wide range of legal studies and for the last 13 years has been one
of our Nation's most respected jurists on the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit.

  I must tell you that Senator D'Amato and I take special pride in
her nomination. She was born and raised in Brooklyn. The day
after her nomination, the front page of the New York Daily News
exclaimed: "A Judge Grows in Brooklyn."

  She attended Cornell where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa,
later Columbia Law School where she was tied for top of her class.
Indeed, she actually attended two law schools, beginning at Har-
vard and finishing at Columbia so that she could be with her hus-
band, Martin, who had returned from Cambridge to begin the prac-
tice of law in New York. Never before Ruth Bader Ginsburg had
anyone been a member of both the Harvard and Columbia Law Re-
views.

  With such a record, you would think it not surprising that she
should be recommended to serve as law clerk to Supreme Court
Justice Felix Frankfurter. Neither is it surprising that at that
time, a time she has changed, Justice Frankfurter thought it would
be inappropriate to have a woman clerk.

  She clerked for Judge Edmund Palmieri, and then entered the
Columbia Law School project on international procedures. She
taught at Rutgers Law School, then Columbia, becoming one of the
first tenured woman professors in the country, and then became
the moving force behind the women's rights project of the American
Civil Liberties Union, the prime architect of the fight to invalidate
discriminatory laws against individuals on the basis of gender.
                                      11

  Her imprint can be found on virtually every gender case which
reached the Supreme Court in the 1970's. She herself argued six
of the cases before the Court and won five of them. The specifics
are well known to members of this honorable committee and will
no doubt be discussed in detail. But I would call attention, sir, sim-
ply to remarks of Erwin N. Griswold, the former Solicitor General
of the United States and dean of the Harvard Law School at the
time Judge Ginsburg was there. He spoke at a special session of
the Supreme Court commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
opening of their new building, as it then was.

  Dean Griswold spoke of the work of attorneys who had appeared
before the Court on behalf of special interest groups, as he termed
it, and he said this:

  I think, for example, of the work done in the early days of the NAACP which was
represented here by one of the country's great lawyers, Charles Hamilton Houston;
work which was carried on later with great ability by Thurgood Marshall. And I
may mention the work done by lawyers representing groups interested in the rights
of women of whom Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an outstanding example.

  It is in that context, Mr. Chairman, that the American Bar Asso-
ciation has given her its highest rating, and she has my most sin-
cere and proud recommendation to this committee.

  Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator D'Amato.

 STATEMENT OF HON. ALFONSE M. D'AMATO, A U.S. SENATOR
                   FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

  Senator D'AMATO. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, let me
second the magnificent introduction that the distinguished senior
Senator, my colleague Senator Moynihan, has made on behalf of
Judge Ginsburg. Let me say that I take very special pride in the
fact that the judge grew and flourished in Brooklyn, my home
town.

  Let me also add to this committee that there is no doubt that she
has distinguished herself as teacher, lawyer, judge, and parent,
with her magnificent and wonderful family here today.

  While we may not agree with all of the learned judge's decisions,
no one can question her honesty, her integrity, her commitment to
the process of law, and I commend her for your approval and ask
that there be an extension for my written remarks to be included
as if read and submitted in their entirety.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. I thank you very much, Sen-
ator.

  [The prepared statement of Senator D'Amato follows:]

                     PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO

  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here this morning to join with my colleague,
Senator Moynihan, to introduce Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to this Committee and
to our nation. As most of you know, Judge Ginsburg comes to us from the rough
and tumble streets of Brooklyn, although her public demeanor would not suggest
such a background. However, I wouldn't let her temperament fool you, for I know
of no one from Brooklyn who did not know how to stand up for themselves and
make their point known.

  As I stated, Judge Ginsburg was born and raised in Brooklyn during the depres-
sion and World War II. Determined to succeed, Judge Ginsburg graduated from Cor-
nell and entered Harvard Law at a time when it was not popular for young women
                                       12

to enter law school. Eventually transferring to and graduating from Columbia Law
School, she had a difficult time breaking the "old boy" network that excluded so
many other fine law graduates. In true Brooklyn form, though, this did not dissuade
her, and through perseverance, she obtained a clerkship with U.S. District Judge
Edmund Palmieri.

  After her clerkship, Judge Ginsburg went on to teach law at Rutgers University,
where, during her nine years, she rose to become a full professor. She moved on to
Columbia University Law School where she taught another nine years. During those
years as a professor, Judge Ginsburg was quite successful before the bench arguing
numerous cases, including winning five of six decisions before the Supreme Court
regarding sex discrimination. Based on her intellect and ability, she was appointed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1980.

  Since her appointment to the federal bench, Judge Ginsburg has written hundreds
of decisions. While I may not agree with her on some of her opinions, I have found
Judge Ginsburg to be honest to a fault, with the utmost in integrity, a keen mind,
and a true belief in the law.

  No Senator will agree with the opinions of a Supreme Court Justice 100 percent
of the time. I know that I will not agree with Judge Ginsburg's decisions all of the
time. However, I do know that hers will be the kind of decisions that will be under-
taken with deliberate care and that even if I disagree with her, I will be confident
that her opinion will not be the result of a rash or ill-thought decision making proc-
ess.

  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased, also, to welcome Judge Ginsburg's family--her hus-
band Martin Ginsburg, a Professor of tax law at Georgetown University and a part-
ner in the Washington office of Fried, Frank, Harris, and Shriver; her daughter
Jane, a law Professor at Columbia University; her son James, a law student at the
University of Chicago and a producer of classical recordings, and her lovely grand-
children.

  Again, it is my pleasure to introduce Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg at her confirma-
tion hearings to be an Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW we will hear from Delegate Eleanor Holmes
Norton. We welcome you to the other body, and thank you for com-
ing over.

      STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, A
DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

  Ms. NORTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, it is my great pleasure to introduce and rec-
ommend Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to you. Now a resident of my
district here in Washington, DC, Judge Ginsburg was born in
Brooklyn. Brooklyn natives, of course, have often spread to far cor-
ners, like the overseas Chinese, sharing the riches of that borough
with places like Washington which thrive on such exports.
  Judge Ginsburg's service on our U.S. Court of Appeals has been
unusually distinguished, a virtually foregone conclusion for any
who knew her before her appointment in 1980. I have known Ruth
Ginsburg for two decades. As a law professor, civil rights and civil
liberties lawyer, she was the chief navigator in the journey that
took women, after more than 100 years, into the safe harbor of the
U.S. Constitution.
  When Ruth Ginsburg founded the ACLU women's rights project,
today's axiom that the 14th amendment applies to women was not
axiomatic at all. As one of Judge Ginsburg's former students has
said, "People forget how things were."
  Judge Ginsburg has spent her life making things how they ought
to be. Using her gifted mind, honed by indefatigably hard work, she
has used the law, always carefully, always defensibly, for all of
those left at the margins, for want of a lawyer or a judge with the
brilliance and commitment to pull them mainstream.
                                       13

  As a lawyer, she was an activist intellectual who brought grace
to both roles. As a judge, Ruth Ginsburg has not only resolved hard
cases, she has contributed to legal theory and made collegiality
among judges and its effect on the law a new and fascinating sub-
ject of scrutiny.

  Those who have expected great things of Ruth Ginsburg have al-
ways gotten what they bargained for. Count on Justice Ginsburg
to keep that unbroken record.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very, very much.
  I know all of you have other duties, and we appreciate your being
here. Thank you for your input. And, Pat, I am delighted that you
had the opportunity to introduce a woman who saves my daughter
Ashley from having to be the second woman nominee to the Su-
preme Court. Thank you.
  Now we will return to semiregular order, which is that Senator
Kennedy would go next. But our distinguished colleague and rank-
ing member of the Armed Services Committee has to attend a hear-
ing at 11, and Senator Kennedy has graciously suggested that he
go next.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR THURMOND
   Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish to thank
Senator Kennedy for letting me go at this time.
  I want to express my appreciation to Senator Hatch for his kind
words. He is a great Senator and a great man, and I appreciate
what you had to say.
  We all welcome Senator Specter back, a great Senator and a true
patriot of this country. So glad to see you in good health now.
  Now, Mr. Chairman, today the Senate begins consideration of the
nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be an Associate Jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court. If confirmed, Judge Ginsburg will
be the 107th person to serve as a Justice, continuing the long tradi-
tion of distinguished jurisprudence which began with Justice John
Rutledge of South Carolina, who was appointed on September 26,
1789. Although I was not privileged to be in the Senate at that
time [Laughter.]
  Lest anyone have doubts--Judge Ginsburg*s will be the 25th Su-
preme Court nomination I have reviewed during my nearly 39
years in the Senate.
   Since its first session in the Royal Exchange Building in New
York City in 1790, the Supreme Court has been an indispensable
part of our Government, securing individual rights and interpreting
the laws of this Nation. Occasionally, however, the Federal courts
have gone beyond their constitutional mandate and used their judi-
cial authority to legislate from the bench. I believe that the Hamil-
tonian vision of the judiciary is a correct one: Judgment, not will,
is to be exercised by the judicial branch.
  Mr. Chairman, we have a very serious responsibility here. Article
II of the Constitution confers upon the Senate the duty of giving
"advice and consent" to the President's appointment of Supreme
Court Justices. The detailed review of judicial nominations has
been assigned by the Senate to the Judiciary Committee. To a
great extent, our colleagues who are not on this committee depend
                                       14

upon our work to make their own decisions on a nominee's quali-
fications to sit on the most important and prestigious court in
America. These hearings also give the public an opportunity to see
the process at work.

  Justices occupy a position of immense power and are tenured for
life. Furthermore, Justices and other Federal judges are not ac-
countable to the public through the ballot box. It is, therefore, im-
perative that the Senate exercise its role in the confirmation proc-
ess with great care, ensuring that the nominee possesses the nec-
essary qualifications to fill this immensely important role.

  Over the years, I have determined the special qualifications I be-
lieve an individual must possess to serve on the Supreme Court,
and they are as follows:

  First, unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be honest, abso-
lutely incorruptible, and completely fair.

  Second, courage. A nominee must possess the courage to decide
tough cases according to the law and the Constitution.

  Third, compassion. While a nominee must be firm in his or her
decisions, they should show mercy when appropriate.

  Fourth, professional competence. The nominee must have the
ability to master the complexity of the law.

  Fifth, proper judicial temperament. The nominee must have the
self-discipline to base decisions on logic, not emotion, and to have
respect for lawyers, litigants, and court personnel.

  Sixth, an understanding of the majesty of our system of govern-
ment. The nominee must understand that only Congress makes the
laws, that the Constitution is changed only by amendment, and
that all powers not specifically delegated to the Federal Govern-
ment are reserved to the States.

  These are the essential qualities which determine the fitness of
an individual to serve on the Court, and it appears to me that
Judge Ginsburg possesses them. She has had a distinguished scho-
lastic and legal career and established a reputation as a person
who thinks twice before acting--an especially valuable quality in a
judge.

  After 13 years on the D.C. Circuit Court, Judge Ginsburg has
written hundreds of opinions, authored numerous articles, and de-
livered many speeches. I am not in agreement with her on every
issue. However, I respect her intelligence and ability, and I look
forward to discussing her approach to constitutional issues and re-
viewing her development on the D.C. Circuit Court.

  Mr. Chairman, as we begin this hearing, I am reminded of the
thoughts conveyed by President Washington to Chief Justice John
Jay and the Associate Justices during the first term of the Su-
preme Court. His comments on the judicial branch remain as in-
sightful and compelling today as when they were first delivered. He
stated, and I quote:

   I have always been persuaded that the stability and success of the National Gov-
ernment, and consequently the happiness of the people of the United States, would
depend in a considerable degree on the interpretation and execution of its laws. In
my opinion, therefore, it is important that the judiciary system should not only be
independent in its operations, but as perfect as possible in its formation.

  Mr. Chairman, I believe this hearing is a continuation of ongoing
efforts to create a judiciary which is as perfect as possible. As we
                                       15

pursue this worthy goal, it is incumbent upon the Senate to closely
review Judge Ginsburg's qualifications to serve on the highest
court in the land.

  Judge Ginsburg, we welcome you here today and look forward to
your testimony.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  [The prepared statement of Senator Thurmond follows:]

                              PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR THURMOND

  Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration of the nomination of Judge
Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be an Associated Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. If confirmed, Judge Ginsburg will be the 107th person to serve as a Justice;
continuing the long tradition of distinguished jurisprudence which began with Jus-
tice John Rutledge of South Carolina, who was appointed on September 26, 1789.
Although I was not privileged to be in the Senate at that time--lest anyone have
doubts!--Judge Ginsburg's nomination will be the 25th Supreme Court nomination
I have reviewed during my nearly 39 years in the Senate.

  Since its first session in the Royal Exchange Building in New York City in 1970,
the Supreme Court has been an indispensable part of our government, securing in-
dividual rights and interpreting the laws of this Nation. Occasionally, however, the
Federal courts have gone beyond their constitutional mandate, and used their judi-

tunity to see the process at work.

  Justices occupy a position of immense power, and are tenured for life. Further-
more, justices and other federal judges are not accountable to the public through
the ballot box. It is therefore imperative that the Senate exercise its role in the con-
firmation process with great care, ensuring that the nominee possesses the nec-
essary qualifications to fill this immensely important role.

   Over the years, I have determined the special qualifications I believe an individ-
ual must possess to serve on the Supreme Court. They are as follows:

   First, unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be honest, absolutely incorruptible,
and completely fair.

   Second, courage. A nominee must possess the courage to decide tough cases ac-
cording to the law and the Constitution.

   Third, compassion. While a nominee must be firm in his or her decisions, they
should show mercy when appropriate.

   Fourth, professional competence. The nominee must have mastered the complexity
of the law.

that only Congress makes the laws, that the Constitution is changed only by amend-
ment, and that all powers not specifically delegated to the Federal government are
reserved to the States.

  These are the essential qualities which determine the fitness of an individual to

of opinions, authored numerous articles and delivered many speeches. I am not in
agreement with her on every issue. However, I respect her intelligence and ability,
and I look forward to discussing her approach to constitutional issues and reviewing
her development on the D.C. Circuit Court.

by President Washington to Chief Justice John Jay and the Associate Justices dur-
                                       16

ing the first term of the Supreme Court. His comments on the judicial branch re-
main as insightful and compelling today as when they were first delivered. He stat-

quote.)

  Mr. Chairman, I believe this hearing is a continuation of ongoing efforts to create
a judiciary which is as perfect as possible. As we pursue this worthy goal, it is in-
cumbent upon the Senate to closely review Judge Ginsburg's qualifications to serve

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR KENNEDY
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to extend my appreciation for the kind words of my good
friend from Utah, and it is a pleasure to serve on this committee
with "Tyrannosaurus" Hatch. [Laughter.]
  I join in congratulating Judge Ginsburg on her nomination, and
in welcoming her before this committee.
  Nominations to the Supreme Court are among the most impor-
tant decisions that any President makes, and the confirmation
process is one of Congress' most important responsibilities.
  The Supreme Court is the guardian of our most basic constitu-
tional rights and liberties. The Justices of the Supreme Court have
the last word on the meaning of the Constitution; and they are
called upon to decide many of the most important and difficult
questions of our time:
  May a State consider the race of its citizens in drawing legisla-
tive districts? May a State impose a greater punishment for a
crime because the criminal is motivated by racial or religious big-
otry? What is the proper boundary between church and state when
government furnishes aid to students in religious schools?
  These are just a few of the questions that the Justices of the Su-
preme Court decided in the past term. The rules announced by the
Court in its decisions affect the daily lives of all Americans.
  Senators must satisfy themselves that a Supreme Court nominee
has the outstanding ability, unquestionable character, and fair and
balanced temperament to decide the important and difficult cases
that come before the Court. And, no less important, Senators must
determine whether a nominee to the Supreme Court possesses a
deep understanding and commitment to the fundamental values of
liberty, fairness, and equality enshrined in the Constitution.
  Our constitutional freedoms are the historic legacy of every
American. The Members of the Senate have an obligation to ensure
that those freedoms are entrusted to women and men on the Su-
preme Court who will preserve their meaning for future genera-
tions.
  Based on her pathbreaking work as a law professor and a legal
advocate for the rights of women, and based on her distinguished
career as a Federal appeals court judge, it appears that Judge
Ginsburg easily meets these high standards. Her creative strate-
gies to win legal recognition of the right of women to equal protec-
                                       17

tion of the laws have earned her the admiration and respect of
every American committed to ending discrimination in our Nation.
Her impressive and scholarly work on the Federal appeals court
here in Washington has earned her a reputation as one of the very
best judges in the United States today.

  The members of this committee, nonetheless, have a constitu-
tional responsibility to carefully examine Judge Ginsburg's opinions
and articles and to ask her about her legal philosophy and ap-
proach to the Constitution, to assure ourselves that she deserves
the high honor of joining the Nation's highest court.

  I commend President Clinton for this excellent nomination, and
I look forward to Judge Ginsburg's testimony.

  The CHAIRMAN. Because we went out of order at the outset, the
next speaker will be Senator Metzenbaum.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR METZENBAUM
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, congratulations on your nomination and wel-
come to these hearings.
  It has been a long time since a Democratic President has made
a Supreme Court nomination. Justice White's resignation means
that all of the remaining Justices were nominated by Republican
Presidents.
  This day is welcome, for many reasons. For 12 years, Supreme
Court nominees have been sent to this committee in the hope of
promoting a political and social agenda directly from the planks of
the Republican Party platform. A core element of that agenda was
the reversal of Supreme Court decisions in the areas of abortion,
civil rights, individual liberties, and the first amendment. Unfortu-
nately, their efforts have met with considerable success.
  As a result, the Supreme Court today is plagued by a vision of
the Constitution which is cramped and narrow. The current Court
lacks either the will or the commitment to make the promises and
principles of our Constitution a reality for all Americans.
  This Nation faces difficult--and sometimes divisive--social prob-
lems. We need leadership that is inclusive and tolerant. And we
need a Supreme Court that is a source of inspiration and moral
leadership. Only then will individual liberty, equal justice, and fun-
damental fairness be a reality for everyday Americans, as we pre-
pare to turn to the 21st century.
  President Clinton took one large step in that direction by nomi-
nating Ruth Bader Ginsburg. No one can seriously claim that the
President selected Judge Ginsburg to carry out a political agenda.
The President found in Judge Ginsburg the nominee he was
searching for, a person of enormous talent and integrity, a gener-
ous character, and an unyielding fidelity to the Constitution and
the rule of law in the service of society.
  Judge Ginsburg's record as a litigator is the envy of lawyers
throughout the country. She spent the bulk of her career as a law-
yer working to secure equal rights for women. She succeeded, due
to her comprehensive knowledge of the law and her keen under-
standing of what would persuade the male members of the Su-
preme Court.
                                       18
  She developed a brilliant litigation strategy, which included at
times using men as plaintiffs in gender discrimination suits. This
tactic helped the then all-male Supreme Court see that discrimina-
tion based on gender was incompatible with the great constitu-
tional principle of equal protection under the law.
  She showed courage and determination, when opportunities were
closed to her due to discrimination against women. She didn't just
get angry and resentful. She fought to change the law for the bene-
fit of all women and men.
  With such an outstanding career as a lawyer, it is no surprise
that President Carter selected her for the Federal Bench. Her ten-
ure on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
has distinguished her as one of the country's finest judges. As
President Clinton said in introducing her to the Nation, she is "pro-
gressive in outlook, wise in judgment, balanced and fair in her
opinions."
  Judge Ginsburg's record is exemplary, and I am frank to say that
I expected nothing less in a nomination by President Clinton. But
there is still more that I want to know.
  As an advocate, Ruth Bader Ginsburg pushed the Court to land-
mark decisions on behalf of women's rights. While she fought for
women one case at a time, she had a goal, a vision of a Constitu-
tion that protected women against discrimination.
  While a circuit court of appeals judge, her duty has been to faith-
fully apply the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court. But, if
confirmed as the next Supreme Court Justice, she would have the
opportunity to shape the law, rather than merely apply it. I want
to know whether Judge Ginsburg will embrace this opportunity to
shape the law to make the enduring principles of our Constitution
a reality for all Americans, no matter how rich or poor, no matter
what race or religion, no matter how unpopular their cause might
be.
  As an appeals court judge, Judge Ginsburg is well known for her
preference for measured or incremental movement in the law. She
speaks of permitting constitutional doctrine, especially in con-
troversial areas, to emerge from a dialog between the courts, other
branches of government, and the people. I am concerned she will
always take a similar approach on the Supreme Court, and I will
make it no secret that I hope she will not.
  When Judge Ginsburg speaks of a dialog, she apparently envi-
sions a concept of gradualism in applying the Constitution's provi-
sions. That causes me concern, because any delay in enunciating or
protecting constitutional rights is justice denied.
  There are times and there are issues when the Supreme Court
must show leadership. History demonstrates that it is sometimes
the Court, rather than Congress or the President, which must have
the will and the vision to define the Constitution's promises of lib-
erty and justice, even when it is unpopular to do so. I expect to in-
quire in this area, to know whether Judge Ginsburg will lead the
Court at such times.
  Judicial leadership in addressing the great social and political
problems of our day can be controversial. Judge Ginsburg will prob-
ably hear much about judicial activism and judge-made laws from
my colleagues during these hearings. I suspect they will warn her
                                      19

against judicial activism, notwithstanding the considerable conserv-
ative judicial activism we have seen from the current Supreme
Court.

  But we must rise above this wornout debate to recognize that
leadership in applying the cherished principles of our Constitution
is not judicial activism. It is leadership we need from Judge Gins-
burg on the Supreme Court.

  T^e role of the Supreme Court in preserving and promoting indi-
vidual liberty, equal opportunity, and social justice must be re-
stored. Judge Ginsburg, your career as an advocate suggests that
you have the intelligence, determination, and courage to begin the
work that needs to be done. Your career as an appeals court judge
suggests that you have the temperament and judicial skills to
begin that restoration. My only question for you during these hear-
ings relates to how you will meet that challenge.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  [The prepared statement of Senator Metzenbaum follows:]

                            PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR METZENBAUM

  Judge Ginsburg, congratulations on your nomination and welcome to these hear-
ings.

   It has been a long time since a Democratic President has made a Supreme Court
nomination. Justice White's resignation means that all of the remaining Justices
were nominated by Republican Presidents. So, I am relieved and pleased that Presi-
dent Clinton has made this nomination.

   This day is welcome for another reason. For twelve years, Supreme Court nomi-
nees have been sent to this committee in the hope of promoting a political and social
agenda directly from the planks of the Republican Party platform. A core element
of that agenda was the reversal of Supreme Court decisions in the areas of abortion,
civil rights, individual liberties, and the first amendment. Unfortunately, their ef-
forts have met with considerable success.

  As a result, the Supreme Court today is plagued by a vision of the Constitution
which is cramped and narrow. The current Court lacks either the will or the com-
mitment to make the promises and principles of our Constitution a reality for all
Americans.

   This Nation faces difficult--and sometimes divisive--social problems. We need
leadership that is inclusive and tolerant. And we need a Supreme Court that is a
source of inspiration and moral leadership. Only then will individual liberty, equal
justice, and fundamental fairness be a reality for everyday Americans as we prepare
to turn to the twenty-first century.

  Judge Ginsburg's record is exemplary; and I am frank to say that I expected noth-
ing less in a nomination by President Clinton. But there is still more that I want
to know.

  As an advocate, Ruth Bader Ginsburg pushed the Court to landmark decisions on
behalf of women's rights. While she fought for women one case at a time, she had
a goal--a vision--of a Constitution that protected women against discrimination.

  While a circuit court of appeals judge, her duty has been to faithfully apply the

Court Justice, she would have the opportunity to shape the law rather than merely
apply it. I want to know whether Judge Ginsburg will embrace this opportunity to
shape the law to make the enduring principles of our Constitution a reality for all
Americans--no matter how rich or poor, no matter what race or religion, no matter
how unpopular their cause might be.

  As an appeals court judge, Judge Ginsburg is well known for her preference for
"measured"--or incremental--movement in the law. She speaks of permitting con-
stitutional doctrine, especially in controversial areas, to emerge from a dialogue be-
tween the courts, other branches of government, and the people. I am concerned she
will always take a similar approach on the Supreme Court; and I will make it no
secret that I hope she will not.

  When Judge Ginsburg speaks of a dialogue, she apparently envisions a concept
of gradualism in applying the Constitution's provisions. That causes me concern be-
cause any delay in enunciating or protecting constitutional rights is justice denied.

  There are times and there are issues when the Supreme Court must show leader-
ship. History demonstrates that it is sometimes the Court--rather than Congress
or the President--which must have the will and the vision to define the Constitu-
tion's promises of liberty and justice, even when it is unpopular to do so. I want
to know whether Judge Ginsburg will lead the Court at such times.

  Judicial leadership in addressing the great social and political problems of our day
can be controversial. Judge Ginsburg will probably hear much about judicial activ-
ism and judge-made laws from my colleagues during these hearings. I suspect they
will warn her against judicial activism, notwithstanding the considerable conserv-
ative judicial activism we have seen from the current Supreme Court.

  But, we must rise above this worn-out debate to recognize that leadership in ap-
plying the cherished principles of our Constitution is not judicial activism. It is lead-
ership we need from Judge Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.

  The role of the Supreme Court in preserving and promoting individual liberty,
equal opportunity, and social justice must be restored. Judge Ginsburg, your career
as an advocate suggests that you have the intelligence, determination, and courage
to begin the work that needs to be done. Your career as an appeals court judge sug-
gests that you have the temperament and judicial skills to begin that restoration.
My only question for you during these hearings is whether you will meet that chal-
lenge.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simpson.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SIMPSON

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in the past, following Howard
has always gotten me pretty well primed up, but not this time, ex-
cept for a few rambling remarks there about Republican Presidents
and a Democratic President, too, he is right on track.

  I appreciate your leadership, Mr. Chairman. You have always
been very fair and open, serious and practical with us.

  Welcome back to Arlen, a wonderful legislator and friend and a
real contributor to this committee.

  Good morning, Judge Ginsburg.
  In going through many of the things that you have written, I
noted an article in the Illinois Law Review where you said, in car-
rying out its duty to consider the President's nominees to the Su-
preme Court, we have a "weighty responsibility to consider what
will serve the national interest." We indeed do, and we will attempt
to carry that out responsibly and with a serious intent of a knowl-
edge of our responsibility by considering, among other things, your
                                       21

judicial philosophy, how you will think and reason, as you con-
template the pressing legal issues of the day, questions of the day,
and we must do that without compromising your judicial independ-
ence.

  There are, of course, other important considerations and quali-
fications for a nominee to the Supreme Court. A nominee's rec-
titude and deportment are critical considerations. We must be cer-
tain that the nominee has the education, the experience, and the
temperament to serve in the highest office in our profession.

  I am certainly pleased to say here the record is remarkably clear.
Indeed, in these areas you may well be overqualified. That is a se-
rious defect in this community. Think of the ones you know who
are.

  As one who loves Gilbert and Sullivan, you would compose your
own lyrics to the tune of "I've got a little list of society offenders
who never would be missed," and you remember the rest of that.

  But the record here is not so obvious or apparent on your judicial
philosophy. So, indeed, as Senator Metzenbaum has said, what
about judicial activism? That will be asked. Some of your writings
seem to imply that it is justified at times, perhaps even forced upon
the courts by congressional inaction. I have seen that problem. It
is very real. No wonder courts enter the fray.

  When considering constitutional issues, how persuasive do you
find the intent of those who drafted the document. You said some
things about that. Your colleagues have or your colleagues-to-be
have. What will you do when their intent is unclear or, even more
appropriately, more unknowable?

   In these hearings, we will try to learn what approach you might
take in deciding the critical questions of our day, and yet only you
will know the extent and substance of response to those questions.
Historical perspective here being an example, the more questions,
the less answers will get you home.

   So for me, your competence and temperament are beyond ques-
tion and we look forward to learning more about your thinking and
reasoning, as you would wish to share it in whatever depth, and
we will know then whether this appointment will serve the na-
tional interest, a very broad and remarkable phrase, but I think,
indeed, from what I know, that your appointment would indeed
serve that interest.

   I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   I might note it is remarkable that 7 years ago the hearing we
had here was somewhat more controversial, and I made a speech
that mentioned the "p" word, philosophy, that we should examine
the philosophy, and most editorial writers of the Nation said that
was not appropriate. At least we have crossed that hurdle. No one
is arguing that any more.
  Senator DeConcini.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DeCONCINI
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Let me join in the praise of you and the ranking member in con-
ducting these hearings and the members of this committee for pro-
                                              22

ceeding. I think it is very important that we process this nomina-
tion as soon as we can.

  Judge Ginsburg, I join the accolades here in your nomination and
those to President Clinton in sending your name here. Twelve
years ago, I helped usher a good friend of mine through the same
process which you are now experiencing. Her nomination was his-
toric at that time. If confirmed, you will join my friend as the sec-
ond woman ever to serve on the Court.

  Like Justice O'Connor, despite your outstanding academic
achievements, your ability to find employment after law school was
deterred by your gender. You are an individual who has suffered
firsthand the effects of discrimination.

  I think that is most fitting for people who are going to interpret
the constitutional rights of individuals who come before them and
will, like you, ultimately, I predict, serve on the Supreme Court.

  You overcame this rude beginning and proceeded to embark upon
a truly remarkable and accomplished professional career. You be-
came a nationally respected law professor. And during that time
and throughout your career, you have made a considerable con-
tribution to the written legal commentary on this subject and oth-
ers.

  Before coming to the bench, you dedicated your efforts to the
struggle for gender equality. In the 1970's, you were instrumentally
involved in the landmark case that ultimately persuaded the Su-
preme Court to establish a greater scrutiny to laws that classify on
the basis of gender.

  I thank you for that, Judge, for my two daughters, one a doctor
and one a lawyer, who have witnessed job discrimination even
today. But their opportunities were enhanced by the fact that you
fought that battle early in life and earlier than they when they
came along.

  For the last 13 years, you have served with distinction on what
is considered the second highest court in the land.

  One comment that has been repeated often since the President
announced your nomination is that you defy the label of liberal or
conservative jurist. Indeed, one news account noted that during
your tenure, you had "often gone out of your way to mediate be-
tween the Court's warring liberal and conservative factions."

  Throughout your judicial career, you have shown great respect
for the institutional integrity of the Court. Over the last few weeks,
I have had a chance to read many of your opinions. To me, they
demonstrate deference to precedent and embody judicial restraint.
I think that is fundamental and so important.

  You have great understanding of the role of a middle-tier appel-
late court. And as you have written, with that role, a judge must
follow the guidance of the Supreme Court.

  However, Judge Ginsburg, as a Supreme Court Justice, you will
not be constrained by a higher court's interpretation. You will have
free rein to interpret our Constitution. And as you have commented
yourself, you will have "the last judicial word" on the "constitu-
tional questions of the day."

  Our constitutional system endows tremendous responsibility and
power to our Supreme Court Justices. Because of that power, I
strongly believe that nominees to that Court should be prepared to
                                              23

tell the committee and the American people how they intend to ap-
proach the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

  A few years back, you wrote a law review article that discussed
the Supreme Court's confirmation process. You concluded by
quoting a law professor who described the Senate's role in the proc-
ess "as second, but not secondary."

  The Senate's constitutional obligation is to examine a nominee's
competence, integrity, experience, and, yes, his or her philosophy.
For the Supreme Court is undeniably a policymaker.

  Our Framers drafted the Constitution in broadly worded prin-
ciples that were intended to protect an evolving society. Constitu-
tional interpretation requires an exercise of discretionary judg-
ment. Thus, we must carefully choose the Constitution's most im-
portant interpreters.

  By no means are we here to secure assurances from you on cer-
tain cases. No one knows exactly how a case will come before you
in the future. But how you approach a constitutional issue and
what you consider in resolving that issue are all part of the judicial
philosophy and part of the questioning that you will undertake in
the next few days.

  The process is not foolproof. In the past, we have had Supreme
Court nominees come before this committee and tell us they had
no agenda--and they did. We have had nominees come before this
committee and tell us that they did not have a fully developed judi-
cial philosophy--but they did. We have had nominees come before
the committee and evoke an image of moderation--but they were
not.

  These past performances by nominees obviously concern this
Senator. Because I believe that the hearings are an integral part
of the confirmation process, honest answers matter greatly in this
process to this Senator.

  Quite frankly, I do not expect this to be a problem with you,
Judge. I am confident that at the conclusion of these hearings, the
Senate and the American public will have a clear vision of your
constitutional philosophy.

  Again, my congratulations, Judge, and also to President Clinton
for his outstanding nomination and taking the time and the process
in which he went through in choosing you to be the next Supreme
Court Justice.

  I look forward to learning more about your judicial philosophy
and your thoughts regarding the Constitution in the next several
days.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                             PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR DECONCINI

   I am pleased to join my colleagues on the committee in welcoming you, Judge
Ginsburg, to your confirmation hearings. Over 12 years ago, I helped usher a good
friend of mine through the same process, which you are now experiencing. Her nom-
ination was historic. If confirmed, you will join my friend as the second woman ever
to serve on the Court.

   Like Justice O'Connor, despite your outstanding academic achievements, your
ability to find employment after law school was deterred by your gender. You are
an individual who has suffered first-hand the effects of discrimination.

   But you overcame this rude beginning and proceeded to embark upon a truly re-
markable and accomplished professional career.

            75-974 O - 94 -- 2
                                              24

  You became a national respected law professor. And during that time and
throughout your career, you have made a considerable contribution to our written
legal commentary.

  Before coming to the bench, you dedicated your efforts to the struggle for gender
equality. In the 1970's, you were instrumentally involved in the landmark cases that
ultimately persuaded the Supreme Court to establish a greater scrutiny to laws that
classify on the basis of gender.

  For the last 13 years, you have served with distinction on what is considered the
second highest court in the land.

  One comment that has been repeated often since the President announced your
nomination is that you defy the label of liberal or conservative jurist.

  Indeed, one news account noted that during your tenure you had "often gone out
of [your] way to mediate between the court's warring liberal and conservative fac-
tions."

  Throughout your judicial career, you have shown great respect for the institu-
tional integrity of the Court. Over the last few weeks, I have had a chance to read
many of your opinions. To me, they demonstrate deference to precedent and embody
judicial restraint.

  You have great understanding of the role of a middle-tier appellate court. And as
you have written, with that role, a judge must follow the guidance of the Supreme
Court.

  However, Judge Ginsburg, as a Supreme Court Justice you will not be constrained
by a higher court's interpretation. You will have free rein to interpret our Constitu-
tion. And as you have commented yourself, you will have "the last judicial word"
on the "constitutional questions of the day."

  Our constitutional system endows tremendous responsibility and power to our Su-
preme Court Justices. Because of that power, I strongly believe that nominees to
that Court should be prepared to tell the committee--and the American people--
how they intend to approach the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

                                                          SENATE ROLE

  A few years back, you wrote a law review article that discussed the Supreme
Court confirmation process. You concluded by quoting a law professor who described
the Senate's role in this process "as second but not secondary."

  The Senate's constitutional obligation is to examine a nominee's competence, in-
tegrity, experience, and yes--his or her judicial philosophy. For the Supreme Court
is undeniabley a policymaker. Our Framers drafted the Constitution in broadly-
worded principles that were intended to protect an evolving society. Constitutional
interpretation requires an exercise of discretionary judgment. Thus, we must care-
fully choose the Constitution's most important interpreters.

  By no means are we here to secure assurances from you on certain cases. No one
knows exactly how a case will come before you in the future. But how you approach
a constitutional issue and what you consider in resolving that issue are all part of
judicial philosophy. And this is all fair questioning.

  This process is not foolproof.
  In the past, we have had Supreme Court nominees come before this committee
and tell us they had no agenda--but did. We have had nominees come before this
committee and tell us they did not have a fully developed judicial philosophy--but
did. We have had nominees come before the committee and evoke an image of mod-
eration--but where not.
  These past performances by nominees obviously concern this Senator. Because I
believe that the hearings are an integral part of the confirmation process, honest
answers matter greatly in this process.
  Quite frankly, I do not expect this to be a problem with you in the least bit. I
am confident that at the conclusion of these hearings, the Senate and the American
public will have a clear vision of your constitutional philosophy.
  In closing, I join my colleagues in extending a warm welcome to you, Judge Gins-
burg. I look forward to our dialogue and witnesses. And I look forward to learning
more about your judicial philosophy and thoughts on the great constitutional issues
of our day.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Grassley.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY

  Senator GRASSLEY. Congratulations, Judge Ginsburg, and, of
course, a warm welcome to your family. I am sure that they take
great pride in this day, just as they have done for all of your ac-
complishments so far in your life, from scholar and law professor
to advocate for gender equality, and now to be a distinguished Fed-
eral appellate judge, as you have for so many years.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, before you go on, you mentioned the
family: I would like to suggest--there are two young children, and
this is a tremendously tedious process. I want them to know they
are welcome. Instead of having to go out there to use the facilities
and the television or anything they want back here, you have free
roam, the kids, literally. So you can go back there, and this is the
one time to exact from your daddy a promise of ice cream or some-
thing for being good. This is the time to do it. [Laughter.]

  I apologize for the interruption, Senator. Seriously, you are wel-
come to use this end, as well.

  Thank you.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Also, they might help us by distracting us
from time to time.
  Today, after so many different distinguished careers you have, is
the beginning of an even more notable achievement. If confirmed,
you will become only the 107th person on the Supreme Court as
a Justice. Indeed, you will join a very elite and a very important
group, all charged with interpreting the Constitution.
  You, Judge Ginsburg, seem to understand the place that the Su-
preme Court occupies within our democracy. Through many of your
writings, I have detected traces of Alexander Hamilton. For exam-
ple, you appreciate that the Framers gave the Court great author-
ity to rule on the Constitution, but armed the Court with no swords
to carry out its pronouncements.
  Alexander Hamilton envisioned that it would be the accountable
branch of government, the legislature, that would make the dif-
ficult choices within and for our society. In many of your opinions,
you have expressly deferred to the will of Congress, as you apply
law to the facts of a case.
  This confirmation hearing gives us an opportunity to explore
your approach to judging and to determine whether you will exer-
cise self-restraint. That, after all, is the touchstone. A Justice must
be willing to accept the Constitution as her rule of decision. And
a Justice must be able to resist temptation to revise or amend the
Constitution according to her definition of what is good public pol-
icy.
  You and I will disagree on specific issues and will disagree on
particular cases. I have no doubt about that. But the issue is not
whether you and I can sign onto some political platform together.
Justice need not be pro-one thing and anti-another thing. That is
why judges were given lifetime tenure, so that they would be insu-
lated from the political pressures of the day. The confirmation proc-
ess need not be a campaign trail of promises by a nominee. These
hearings are about judicial philosophy, not about political results.
  Through much of the second half of this century, the Supreme
Court has evolved into a political institution and away from being
a legal institution. That trend has diminished somewhat in recent
                                              26

years, with the nomination and confirmation of individuals an-
chored in the Constitution and individuals who have a deferential
approach to the political accountable branches of government.
Some political activists, including some of my distinguished col-
leagues on this committee, are hoping your presence on the Court
will bring back an era of political judging. But that view shows a
misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court.

  Your fidelity to the Constitution, your appreciation of its frame-
work of limited powers, and your understanding of the role of Con-
gress and the States in making law--these are the important quali-
ties. In addition, and no less important, a Justice must possess an
open mind, or what Justice Frankfurter called "a capacity of disin-
terested judgment."

  I look forward to exploring these ideas in greater detail with you
during these hearings. Once again, I say congratulations to you
and all your friends and your family.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley follows:]

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY

  Congratulations, Judge Ginsburg, and welcome to your family. I am sure they
take great pride in this day, just as they have done with all of your accomplish-
ments--from scholar and law professor--to advocate for gender equality--to distin-
guished Federal appellate judge.

  But today marks the beginning of an even more notable achievement. If con-
firmed, you will become only the 107th person to become a Supreme Court Justice.
Indeed, you will join a very elite and important group, charged with interpreting
the Constitution.

  You, Judge Ginsburg, seem to understand the place the Supreme Court applies
within our democracy. Through many of your writings, I have detected traces of Al-
exander Hamilton. For example, you appreciate that the Framers gave the Court
great authority to rule on the Constitution, but armed the Court with no swords
to carry out its pronouncements. Hamilton envisioned that it would be the account-
able branch of government--the Legislature--that would make the difficult policy
choices. In many of your opinions, you have expressly deferred to the will of Con-
gress as you apply law to the facts of a case.

  This confirmation hearing gives us an opportunity to explore your approach to
judging and determine whether you will exercise self-restraint. That, after all, is the
touchstone. A Justice must be willing to accept the Constitution as her rule of deci-
sion. And, a Justice must be able to resist the temptation to revise or amend the
Constitution according to her views of what is good public policy.

  We will disagree on specific issues and particular cases; I have no doubts about
that. But the issue is not whether you and I can sign on to some political platform
together. A Justice need not be "pro-one thing" and "anti-another thing." Judges
were given lifetime tenure to insulate them from the political pressures on the day.
The confirmation process need not be a campaign trail of promises by a nominee.
These hearings are about judicial philosophy, not political results.

  Through much of the second half of this century, the Supreme Court had grown
into a political institution and away from being a legal institution. That trend has
diminished somewhat in recent years, with the nomination and confirmation of indi-
viduals anchored in the Constitution and deferential to the politically accountable
branches of government. Some political activists are hoping your presence on the
Court will bring back an era of political judging. But that view misunderstands the
role of the Supreme Court.

  Your fidelity to the Constitution, your appreciation for its framework of limited
powers, and your understanding of the role of Congress and the States in making
law--these are the important qualities. In addition, and no less important, a Justice
must possess an open mind, or what Justice Frankfurter called, "a capacity for dis-
interested judgment."

  I look forward to exploring these ideas in greater detail with you during these
hearings. Once again, congratulations.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Leahy.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, I welcome you and your family. I think this has been an
exciting trip for you and your family, from your time in Vermont
when you got the call from the White House to being here today.
  The CHAIRMAN. I wondered how you were going to get Vermont
into this.
  Senator LEAHY. Your wondering is on your time, Mr. Chairman.
  I am glad to see you here, because you are going to be on a bench
that guarantees the liberties all of us hold dearly. Whether we are
Republicans or Democrats, liberal or conservative, it makes no dif-
ference. It is the Supreme Court that gives us the guarantees of
the Constitution.
  I have been struck by the breadth and distinction of your record,
as I have read it, during the past few years. But I think the proud-
est achievements in many ways are the landmark Supreme Court
cases you fought that literally changed the destiny of women in
this country.
  Much has been said about those victories, and a lot more is going
to be said during these hearings. Let me say something: I think I
speak for most parents in my own State of Vermont, when I thank
you. I thank you personally for helping to contribute to a world
where my daughter Alicia will have opportunities equal to those
open to my sons Kevin and Mark, and I owe you a deep, deep sense
of gratitude for that.
  I think without your pioneering efforts, there is no guarantee
that the progress that has been made so far would have occurred,
and I applaud you for that. In fact, even without this nomination
to the Supreme Court, you could have been satisfied with your
place in history, just because of what you have done in that one
area.
  But you come here with such great qualifications--the court of
appeals, teaching at Columbia and Rutgers--but also with a rep-
utation as a fair and thoughtful jurist. I believe the ABA rec-
ommendation indicates that.
  But a brilliant legal mind and volumes of circuit court opinions
are far from being the only requirements that go into making a
good Supreme Court Justice. You also possess life experience that
is so very, very important.
  Your mother, like so many women of her generation, certainly
led a hard life. She was a motivated student--graduating from
high school at the age of 15. But she went to work in New York's
garment district to put not herself, but her brother through college.
  You yourself, the first man or woman to be a member of both the
Harvard and Columbia Law Reviews, graduated tied for first in
your Columbia Law School class with impeccable credentials, but
then found there was no law firm in New York that might offer you
a job.
  Prestigious judges and justices made no bones about the fact that
they couldn't have a woman as a law clerk. Or when you worked
in a Social Security office, while your husband Martin--whom I am
glad to see here--was serving in the military, you had to take a
lower paying job because you were pregnant. These are days that
are not that far gone, but let us hope they are gone now forever.
                                              28

  So the kind of things you did to break into what had been a
closed world before, these are things you cannot learn about in a
book and you can't read about and you can't write about. You had
to do it, and you did.

  I was moved that day in the Rose Garden, when I stood there
with you and President Clinton and you spoke about the experi-
ences of your mother. These were not words that just come from
a page. They come from the heart and they come from a lifetime
of experience, and I think they moved every single person, no mat-
ter what their political background, in that gathering in the Rose
Garden.

  I think of cases like Reed, Frontier, Wiesenfeld, and Goldfarb.
These are legendary cases. There isn't a law student who can get
through law school without reading them. They came from your
briefs.

  Judge, as I said before, the Senate's duty to advise and consent
is an extremely important charge, but in exercising this respon-
sibility, we have to consider certain threshold qualities--judgment,
temperament, experience, intellectual distinction, moral fiber. But
we also go into the judicial philosophy.

  We will have meaningful questions and I believe meaningful an-
swers, and we will ask you what you think and what kind of a Jus-
tice you want to be. But I think that you will also remember, when
you go on the Court--as I know you will--what the Court means
to everyday, ordinary people, like Sharron Frontiero and Stephen
Wiesenfeld, your former clients, but also to others, like Barbara
Johns and Clarence Earl Gideon. Barbara Johns attended classes
in makeshift tar-paper shacks in a segregated high school in Vir-
ginia, but her case was one of five that we now know as Brown v.
Board of Education. Clarence Gideon, who couldn't afford a lawyer,
was convicted of breaking into a pool hall, but he said, "I am inno-
cent." And the Supreme Court took up his handwritten petition,
scrawled on plain paper. And as we know from "Gideon's Trumpet,"
Gideon got a lawyer, was acquitted of the charges against him, and
changed the whole way our criminal justice system works.

  That is what the Supreme Court stands for in this country, and
that is the Court where we expect people can go and say, "My
rights are being trampled, and you, you nine people, are the only
people that can guarantee the Constitution means what it says to
us." That is the kind of Supreme Court Justice we want; not a Re-
publican, not a Democrat, not a liberal and not a conservative, but
somebody who looks first and foremost at the rights of ordinary
people.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows:]

                              PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY

  We are a nation blessed in many ways. But our greatest blessings are the individ-
ual liberties guaranteed by our Constitution. The nine men and women who serve
as justices of the Supreme Court are the final guardians of these freedoms.

  Because of all that is at stake, a lifetime appointment to this bench is perhaps
the most sacred trust that can be bestowed on an individual. Because of what is
at stake, the Senate's responsibility of advice and consent in these proceedings is
perhaps its most important duty.

  Judge Ginsburg, reviewing your record over these past weeks, I have been struck
by its breadth and distinction. But perhaps your proudest achievements are the
                                          29

landmark Supreme Court cases you fought that literally changed the destiny of
women in this country. Much has been made said about these victories, and much
more will be said throughout the course of these hearings. So let me just add this:

  I think I speak for most parents in my State of Vermont when I thank you--per-
sonally--for helping to contribute to a world where someday my daughter will have
opportunities equal to those open to my sons. Without your pioneering efforts, there
is no guarantee that the progress that has been made so far would have occurred.
All of us owe you a great debt of gratitude.

  You come before this Committee with sterling qualifications. In your 13 years on
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and before then teaching at Columbia and Rut-
gers, you have distinguished yourself as a top flight legal scholar. Along with having
the reputation as a fair and thoughtful jurist, colleagues from the bench, scholars
who comment on your work and lawyers who appear before you point to your keen
intellect and ability for astute legal analysis.

  But a brilliant legal mind and volume of circuit opinions are far from the only
requirements that go into making a proper Justice of the Supreme Court. And they
are far from the only attributes you offer. You also possess the life experience that
makes you know the world of most people is more troubled than the confines of the
courthouse or academia.

  Your mother--like so many women of her generation--led a hard life. She was
a motivated student--graduating from high school at age fifteen. But she went to
work in New York's garment district to put her brother, not herself, through college.

  You yourself, the first man or woman to be a member of both the Harvard and
Columbia Law Reviews, graduating tied for first in your Columbia Law School class
with impeccable credentials, could not find a law firm in New York that would offer
you a job.

  Prestigious judges and justices made no bones about denying you clerkships, just
because you were a woman.

  When you worked in a Social Security office while your husband, Martin, served
in the military, you were forced to accept a lower-paying job because you were preg-
nant.

  Your experiences breaking into what was--and to a surprising degree still is--a
man's world are credentials that cannot be attained from books or briefs. You know
what it means to be excluded, what it means not to be taken at your worth as a
full member of society. And it is these experiences, I suspect, that you still draw
upon every time you have to decide a truly tough case. Listening to your comments
in the Rose Garden, I could tell especially how your mother's spirit inspires you to
this day.

  These experiences also spurred your pathbreaking role in litigating the major Su-
preme Court cases that advanced constitutional protections against sex discrimina-
tion. Reed, Frontiero, Wiesenfeld, Goldfarb--all legendary cases that every law stu-
dent now reads in constitutional law class. From your briefs and arguments, they
have become some of the Supreme Court's most revered works.

  Judge Ginsburg, as I said before, the Senate's duty to advise and consent is an
extremely important charge. In exercising this responsibility, the Senate must of
course consider certain threshold qualities--judgment, temperament, experience, in-
tellectual distinction, moral fiber.

  But we must look beyond that, probing the nominee's judicial philosophy--how
she thinks--how she views the role of the Constitution in society. Does she--like
so many great conservative and liberal justices who have come before--regard the
Constitution as an unbreachable wall separating the state from our liberties? Or
does the nominee have a narrow, crimped view of our founding principles?

  Judge Ginsburg, during these hearings, you will be pressed on many important
issues. That is our responsibility. While it is inappropriate for you to be asked about
specific cases that may be pending before the Court, the Committee cannot satisfy
its constitutional obligation unless it can learn what your constitutional vision is--
how you think about the great issues of the day.

  This requires asking meaningful questions and receiving meaningful answers. The
Committee's weighty responsibility for advice and consent is constant.

  Judge Ginsburg, I am sure you have thought over the past weeks at least, what
kind of a justice you want to be on the Supreme Court. When you are confirmed,
as I expect you will be, I hope you will remember what the Court means to every-
body, ordinary people like Sharron Frontiero and Stephen Wiesenfeld, your former
clients, and to others like Barbara Johns and Clarence Earl Gideon.

  Barbara Johns attended classes in makeshift tar-paper shacks in a segregated
high school in Virginia. Barbara Johns knew that separate would never mean equal
and, with her parents, resolved to fight for her rights. Her case was one of five that
together we now know as Brown v. Board of Education.
                                          30

  Clarence Gideon, who could not afford a lawyer, was convicted of breaking into
a pool hall and stealing money out of a jukebox. "I am innocent," he claimed. The
Supreme Court took up his petition, scrawled by hand on plain paper, listened to
his arguments, and gave his constitutional rights content and meaning. Thanks to
the Supreme Court, Gideon got a lawyer and was acquitted of the charges against
him.

  This is what the Supreme Court stands for in our country. Sharron Frontiero,
Barbara Johns and Clarence Gideon were hardly powerful or well connected, but
they could rely on the Supreme Court to listen fairly to their pleas for justice. The
Supreme Court is the institution--really unique in the world--all of us, rich or poor,
famous or forgotten, can look to for justice; The place where anyone can go to and
say, "I will be heard, and I will have my rights."

  Let me conclude my remarks where I began. The Constitution is the soul of this
country. I will be looking during these hearings for the intensity of your feelings
about the liberties that make this country special, and your devotion to the Court
as the protector of those rights. I want you to be a justice who recognizes the impor-
tance of this role--a justice who perceives your pivotal place in the history of our
democracy, and the great trust that has been placed in your care.

  I would not expect you to be outspoken on this score--your nature is to let your
actions from the bench speak for themselves. But I do expect--really I know--that
in the days ahead we will get a sense of your quiet determination and inner zest
for the cause of justice--a cause to which you have dedicated your life.

  Welcome to you and your family. I look forward to discussing these issues with
you in the days ahead.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Specter.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SPECTER
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, I welcome you here with my colleagues, and I
compliment you on an outstanding academic, professional, and ju-
dicial record--some 322 opinions and still counting, and 79 articles.
  Notwithstanding that outstanding record, I do express concern
that some of my colleagues have expressed virtual approval of your
nomination even before the hearings have begun, and I believe that
that raises some significant problems.
  I think that, first, there is a tendency to look at the hearings as
pro forma or perhaps just going through the motions with con-
firmation a virtual assurance. Second, I am concerned about the
real risk of undermining public confidence that the Senate will vig-
orously discharge its constitutional duty of advice and consent on
a nominee who will have such a profound effect on the daily lives
of more than 250 million Americans, with so many 5--4 decisions
on the crucial issues of the day.
  I have long expressed my own concern about judicial activism
and the Supreme Court being a superlegislature, with the concern
about undermining the vital constitutional principle of separation
of powers.
  At the outset let me say that, as I read your writings, I agree
with much of what you say; and that if you were a Senator offering
your ideas and legislation on the Senate floor, I would be inclined
to cosponsor a good bit of what you articulate.
  But the difficulty with judicial activism, as I see it, is that it is
fine when we agree with your activism, but it is very problemsome
if the principle is established that judicial activism is appropriate.
  One of my colleagues referred to the agenda of the nominees of
two Republican administrations and made it plain that he doesn't
favor that kind of judicial activism. And I believe that, as a matter
                                          31

of principle, it is vital to keep the activism out of the judicial line
as much as is possible.

  I have been very much impressed with the breadth of your
writings and the openness and the candid approach which you have
taken. When you talk about extension of benefits where there is an
equal protection violation, and the Court then extends benefits to
those not covered by legislation, you are candid in saying that you
are legislating a bit. And any legislation by the Court is a matter
of concern.

  When you take up the equal protection issue and talk about bold
interpretation and talk about judges being uneasy in the gray zone
between interpretation and alteration of the Constitution, those
raise concerns to me about where activism may lead.

  Again, I repeat, I admire the positions you have taken and what
you have achieved as a litigant and what you have done as a jurist.
And I also say that on the bench you have not carried forward the
lines which you have written. But as one of my colleagues has
noted, when you are on the Supreme Court--how did my colleague
put it?--you will have a free hand in doing a great deal more.

  So I think these hearings are very important as we take a look
at your record, as we take a look at what you have written and see
how that may be applied. And as noted by a number of my col-
leagues, I think we are past the day where there is an issue about
the propriety of inquiring into judicial philosophy, although we do
not want you to answer how you are going to decide specific cases.

  I have noted your writing that the second opinion by the Senate
is a very important second opinion and your endorsement of the
proposition that the Senators should have equal latitude with the
President in deciding which nominees are good for the country.

  Beyond those theoretical issues, there are many very important
matters that are on the cutting edge of critical considerations for
the American people, and I look forward to these hearings and
hope that we will be able to have an open exchange where we will
have some real idea as to how you see your role as a Supreme
Court Justice contrasted with a court of appeals judge, where you
will have a freer hand and where there will be a question as to how
you will apply the writings on legislation and expansive interpreta-
tion of constitutional rights.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
   Senator Heflin.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HEFLIN

   Senator HEFLIN. Judge Ginsburg, I welcome you and congratu-
late you on your selection as a nominee for the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to participate in the
confirmation process of a number of nominees for our Nation's
highest court. I have during past hearings seen the organized dis-
tortions of interest groups, heard the roars of extreme party loyal-
ists, and witnessed the divisiveness of politics. I have in a sense
seen blood shed during past confirmation hearings.

  This time I believe we will see a process remarkably free of acri-
mony and partisan bickering. Already there is a noticeable dif-
                                              32

ference. What a change of atmosphere from that of the recent past:
Congeniality prevails over confrontation; back-slapping has re-
placed back-stabbing; inquiry is the motivation rather than injury.
While it remains to be seen whether this climate of goodwill will
last, at least for now we are scaling the heights of bipartisan co-
operation.

  Judge Ginsburg, you deserve much of the credit for this fresh
new atmosphere. The excellence of your record has itself made your
nomination a source of consensus. Much of the credit must also go
to my Republican colleagues for their approach to this process. Too
often in the past, both parties have suffered from the nearsighted-
ness that sometimes comes from wearing the blinders of partisan
allegiance. Finally, a large share of the credit must also go to the
President for avoiding a selection based on litmus tests or ideology.

  This respite of goodwill is a gift to all of us. Indeed, it is a rare
opportunity for this committee and the public we represent to en-
gage in an enlightened dialog with, in my judgment, a future mem-
ber of our highest court. Freed of the turmoil that has often marred
the confirmation process, this committee and the full Senate will
have an opportunity to more properly and objectively play the advi-
sory role with which the Constitution charges us.

  In that spirit, let me add that my own review of your record
leaves me highly impressed. I find particularly encouraging your
writings on the need for collegiality and consensus in deciding
cases, while adhering to principle. You have also said that a judge's
role is to see beyond the often misleading claims of ideological la-
bels. You observe, for example, that a description like "judicial ac-
tivism" can be a battle cry for both the right and the left, and that
a phrase like "original intent" is a signpost along an unending and
uncertain road.

  I welcome this insightful candor on your part. It reveals a
healthy disdain for ideological dogma and a fresh receptiveness to
intellectual challenge.

  If these instincts are any guide, your service on the Supreme
Court would honor that institution and our Nation. You have the
potential to break free from the polarization of the left and the
right. You offer the promise of reflective, nonideological, and fair
jurisprudence. And I for one know of no other values more vital to
a sound judicial temperament.

  I am optimistic that your brand of judicial decisionmaking will
set a standard, and I am also hopeful that the spirit of goodwill
that has graced this process so far will set a standard for appoint-
ments to come. I look forward to your testimony and to a discussion
of your vision, philosophy, and values over the next few days.

  I welcome you today and wish you well.

  This time, I believe we will see a process remarkably free of acrimony and par-
tisan bickering. Already, there is a noticeable difference. What a change of atmos-
phere from that of the recent past: Congeniality prevails over confrontation; back-
slapping has replaced back-stabbing; inquiry is the motivation rather than injury.
While it remains to be seen whether this climate of goodwill will last, for now, at

  Judge Ginsburg, you deserve much of the credit for this fresh new atmosphere--
the excellence of your record has itself made your nomination a source of consensus.
Much of the credit must also go to my Republican colleagues for their approach to

nally, a large share of credit must also go to the President for avoiding a selection
based on litmus tests or ideology.

  This respite of goodwill is a gift to us. Indeed, it is a rare opportunity for this

a future member of our highest court. Freed of the turmoil that has often marred
the confirmation process, this committee and the full Senate will have an oppor-
tunity to more properly and objectively play the advisory role with which the Con-
stitution charges us.

  In that spirit, let me add that my own review of your record leaves me highly
impressed. I find particularly encouraging your writings on the need for collegiality
and consensus in deciding cases, while adhering to principle. You have also said
that a judge's role is to see beyond the often misleading claims of ideological labels.
You observe, for example, that a description like "judicial activism" can be a battle

  I welcome this insightful candor on your part. It reveals a healthy disdain for ide-
ological dogma, and a fresh receptiveness to intellectual challenge.

  If these instincts are any guide, your service on the Supreme Court would honor

izations of the left and right. You offer the promise of reflective, nonideological, and

testimony and to a discussion of your vision, philosophy, and values over the next

   I welcome you today and wish you well.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I have never heard you so articulate or
so rhetorically eloquent. Obviously major surgery does a lot to peo-
ple up here. You are looking good, and we have been welcoming
Senator Specter back, but you have gone through one heck of a
summer and spring, and it is great to see you in such great health
and making such fine statements.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, thank you, sir. I appreciate that.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Senator Brown, who has not had any major
surgery, is next. [Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. But we still welcome him back.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is right.

                OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BROWN

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, let me add my welcome to you as well. It is
clear from looking at your record that your commitment to the law
is a family affair. I note that your husband Martin is a distin-
guished professor at Georgetown University and that your daugh-
ter is a tenured professor at Columbia Law School. They tell me
that even your son, who is currently on leave from law school, is
a law student at the University of Chicago. That kind of family
                                              34

commitment, I think, bodes well for the endeavor that is ahead for
you.

  I also note a number of firsts in your background that I think
any of us would take enormous pride from: No. 1 in your class at
Cornell; among the first nine women admitted to Harvard Law
School; No. 1 in your class at Columbia Law School; the second
woman in history on the faculty of Rutgers Law School; and the
first woman to ever serve on the faculty of Columbia Law School.

  You are also the first woman to make law review at two Ivy
League schools, which has already been noted, and you are among
the first 20 law professors to teach at any American law school.

  Your record is extraordinary by any account and I think is one
of the reasons that you have the kind of welcome this morning that
you have enjoyed.

  This seat, as I know you know, is a very special one for Colorado.
It is special because Byron White is so respected and so honored
in the State. I think of Byron White's contribution as more than
simply being one of the finest athletes in the history of our country,
which, of course, he has been, perhaps more than even being one
of the finest scholars to ever serve our country in the highest court.
He has been both of those. But I think perhaps what is significant
for our deliberations this morning is Byron White's integrity that
he has brought to the process.

  Ultimately, I think the concern of the committee is for integrity,
perhaps more than any particular issue. I tend to think it affects
all of the things we will discuss, most particularly the philosophy
you bring as a Justice on the Supreme Court.

  Our Founding Fathers laid out a Constitution that I don't think
any of them thought would remain unchanged forever. As a matter
of fact, as you know, the amending process started immediately
with the first 10 amendments in what we now call the Bill of
Rights. That Bill of Rights was a process not only to bring equity
but also to get the measure passed and approved as it went for
ratification to the various States.

  But the Constitution laid out a process for its change. Our
Founding Fathers never thought that that document would remain
unchanged and specifically provided for how it could be changed
and updated. And I note that Thomas Jefferson had suggested not
only the need for change and adaptation, but had even suggested
perhaps a constitutional convention that might take place every 20
years.

  I, for one, think that idea would be an excellent one, but the
question I think it raises is this: Do we respect the amendment
process and reserve changes in our Constitution for that process,
a process that involves levels of government closer to the people,
elected representatives that can be eliminated from office if their
constituents disagree? Or do we believe the amendment process can
take place by those who are appointed to the Court?

  That strikes me not just as a matter of favoring the woman's
right to choose or opposing it, or favoring changes in the construc-
tion of the equal protection clause, or favoring or opposing changes
in the interpretation of the 10th amendment, but one of integrity
of the Constitution itself.
                                               35

  It seems to me it is a question that rises beyond whether we like
the makeup of the Framers of the Constitution, but one of whether
we will respect the integrity of the process they set in motion. And
so, at least for me, I think the fundamental question that we will
try and explore this week will be one of what kind of approach you
will take in updating the Constitution and amending it, what your
thoughts and philosophies are in that respect.

  Once again, let me add a real sense of joy in the accomplish-
ments you bring to this job. I think it is clear that you have the
intellectual capacity to be a very distinguished member of the U.S.
Supreme Court. I look forward to a chance to explore with you the
issues that I think you will be facing in those years.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Simon.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SIMON

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And as I have lis-
tened to my colleagues, Judge Ginsburg, and I know of your inter-
est in opera, it sounds not like the triumphal march of "Aida" but
the triumphal march of Judge Ginsburg here. We welcome you, and
particularly we welcome your son from Illinois here. [Laughter.]

  As I have read your opinions and some of your writings, as you
probably never anticipated U.S. Senators would read them, I have
the impression of a solid scholar, but someone who is cautious. And
my guess is that is the kind of Supreme Court nominee that you
will be.

  If I may comment, Mr. Chairman, just a moment on the process
itself, I think first the President handled this properly in taking
time, in consulting with members of this committee and consulting
with legal scholars around the Nation.

  It is very interesting, as you look at the history of nominations,
when Presidents have acted quickly, with rare exceptions, the
nominations have not been strong nominations. When Presidents
have taken their time, there generally has been a superior quality
to the nomination. And I think President Clinton and Attorney
General Reno and his counsel, Bernie Nussbaum, are to be com-
mended on the time that was taken.

  The second thing I want to commend you on Mr. Chairman, is
having one portion of the hearing a closed hearing where any nega-
tive charges, which may or may not have substance, are heard in
that closed hearing. And then if there is something substantial,
then the public can know about it. But if someone somewhere has
a charge that a nominee embezzled $50,000 10 years ago, we don't
need that on national television immediately. That ought to be
looked at in a private session. And then if there is substance, we
look at it openly.

  Judge Ginsburg, I think you are doing very well with this com-
mittee. In fact, maybe we ought to stop the hearings right here
from your perspective. You face a much harsher judge, however,
than this committee, and that is the judgment of history. And that
judgment is likely to revolve around the question: Did she restrict
freedom or did she expand it?
                                                36

  I am optimistic that the judgment of history will be a favorable
one for you.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Cohen, a new member of the committee and a very wel-
come member of the committee, although he has had experience in
the past in the other body on the Judiciary Committee. It is nice
to have you here, Senator, on this nomination.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COHEN
  Senator COHEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge
Ginsburg, welcome to this hearing.
  Senator Brown suggested I might try to approach a discussion
with you in a manner different than that pursued by all who have
preceded me, and that is quite a challenge in itself. In preparing
for the hearing, I was rummaging through the writings of Ambrose
Bierce, an American writer and journalist, and I would note par-
enthetically the author of '"The Devil's Dictionary," a book that
many people in this country may feel we refer to in order to color
and shade our words from time to time.
  Bierce related the story of an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court who was sitting by the river when a traveler approached and
said, "I'd like to cross. Would it be lawful to use this boat?" "It
will," came the reply. "After all, it's my boat." The traveler thanked
him, jumped in the boat, pushed it into the water, embarked and
rowed away. The boat sank and the man was drowned.
  "Heartless man," cried an indignant spectator. "Why didn't you
tell the man that the boat had a hole in it?" "The matter of the
boat's condition," said the great jurist, "was not brought before me."
  Now, during the next several days, the committee hopes to bring
before the American people the matter of your condition and that
of your intelligence and competence and philosophy on the role and
responsibility of the Court in our lives.
  It is interesting that out of all the institutions in our three
branches of government, the Supreme Court remains to most
Americans the least well known, the least understood, and, per-
haps not so paradoxically, the most revered. With the national
press corps recording virtually every step or misstep that a Presi-
dent makes, the American people are fully aware that the Nation's
Chief Executive is bound to be a colossus with imperfect feet, and
it is no state secret that the American people hold the legislative
branch in what we can only charitably call a minimum of high re-
gard.
  It is only the judicial branch, and particularly the Supreme
Court, that has significantly grown in stature since its creation
some 200 years ago. For the vast majority of people, the Justices,
their deliberations, their decisionmaking processes, all remain
shrouded in secrecy. There is almost an ecclesiastical aura and
mystery that surrounds that temple where final and unreviewable
power is exercised.
  Prof. Laurence Tribe, who is no stranger to this committee, has
described the profound nature of the Court's influence on our lives.
He has written that:
                                              37

  A President resigns, a gargantuan corporation disintegrates, a frightened but
hopeful child marches to school with her military escort past a hostile crowd, all be-
cause nine black-robed figures in Washington have gleaned new wisdom from an old
and hallowed document. The sweep of the Supreme Court's influence is so vast that
it cannot be grasped by the eye.

  The Washington Post has published a thorough three-part series
on your life and career, and there were many things that caught
my eye in those articles. One involved your comments in which you
express some concerns about the Kahn case. According to the arti-
cle, you wrote a letter back in 1975 to one of your former law
school students, expressing some apprehension that Justice Wil-
liam O. Douglas, whose widowed mother had had a very rough
time financially, might not like a case challenging widows' benefits.

  Now, most people cling to the illusion that Supreme Court Jus-
tices are simply black-robed oracles who peer through lenses that
are unclouded by the personal experiences and biases that afflict
ordinary mortals. But I think you, in writing that letter, under-
stood what Justice Cardozo revealed some years before. He said,
"We may try to see things as objectively as we please. Nonetheless,
we can never see them with any eyes except our own. To that test,
they are all brought, a former pleading or an act of parliament, the
wrongs of paupers, the rights of princes, a village ordinance or a
nation's charter."

  What I hope is that in the next several days we can get a better
sense of the experiential and intellectual forces within you that will
provide some indication of the direction that you are likely to pur-
sue in the days in which you are going to remain beyond the reach
of public opinion and beyond that of congressional recall.

   One of my colleagues earlier indicated he has expressed opposi-
tion to nominees who were advocates as private citizens and whom
he feared would remain so while on the Court. Today he offered,
I think, some expressions of mild disappointment. While once you
were an advocate, his fear is that you have become a jurist while
serving as a judge and might continue to do so. Let me express my
hope that you will maintain a jurist's approach to the law rather
than that of an advocate.

  Justice Cardozo, I think, in his most concise and penetrating
comment reminded us that in the final analysis there is no guaran-
tee of justice except the personality of the judge. I am hopeful that
at the conclusion of these proceedings the American people will be
satisfied, as we will, that we will have a guarantee of justice and
that justice will be done.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Judge, this is a historic occasion, but it is particularly historic be-
cause the next person to make a statement will be the first woman
ever to preside over a Judiciary Committee proceeding for the
Court, and it is appropriate that the first person over whom she
presides is likewise a woman--oh, I beg your pardon. [Laughter.]
  With that, I will introduce Senator Kohl from Wisconsin, who, I
assure you, is not a woman and has done this before and done it
well and is the most distinguished member of this committee.
[Laughter.]
   Senator Kohl, I apologize.
                                          38

                OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR KOHL

   Senator KOHL. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, as we all know, last month President Clinton
announced that he would nominate you to serve on the Supreme
Court. At that Rose Garden ceremony, you told the President that
you look forward to stimulating weeks this summer. I assume that
you were referring to this confirmation process, and I hope very
much that we don't disappoint you.
  Although the Constitution is silent on what standard to apply in
evaluating a nominee, you have provided some useful guidance.
You have noted that in an appointment to the Supreme Court the
Senate comes second, but is not secondary. And I agree. As a mem-
ber of this committee, I have developed my own criteria for judg-
ment.
   First, I look for a nominee of exceptional character, competence,
and integrity. That you clearly have, as an honored student, an ef-
fective advocate, and also as a very distinguished appellate judge.
But I am struck by more than your professional honors. I am im-
pressed by your dedication to principles that you have not only
talked about but lived.
   For example, you didn't just resign from discriminatory clubs;
you refused to join them in the first place. You didn't just talk
about gender equality; you fought for it. And we all admire that.
   Second, I seek a Justice who understands and accepts both the
basic principles of the Constitution and its core values implanted
in our society. We do not elect Justices. They are given lifetime ten-
ure precisely because we want to insulate the Court from the pull
and the tug of partisan politics. That insulation makes it critical
that we be certain that a nominee will protect the civil rights and
the liberties of all Americans.
   Third, I want a Justice with a sense of compassion. Behind every
abstract legal principle, there are real people with real problems.
It is the Court that must be their sanctuary and their shelter. Jus-
tice Black put it best when he said, "Under our constitutional sys-
tem, courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge
for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless,
weak, outnumbered, or because they are non-conforming victims of
prejudice and public excitement."
   In other words, Judge Ginsburg, the courts are places for doing
justice, and not just giving logic to the law.
   Judge you are not a stealth nominee. Your record is clear, and
there is little opposition to your confirmation. In fact, conventional
wisdom has you all but confirmed. But, even so, the Senate should
not act as a rubber stamp.
   The President is asking us to entrust you with an immense
amount of power, and before we decide to give it to you, we need
to know what is in your heart and what is in your mind. We don't
have a right to know in advance how you will rule on cases which
will come before you, but we do need and we deserve to know what
you think about the fundamental issues that surround these cases.
   So today we begin a public discussion which is the only oppor-
tunity we will have on behalf of the American people to engage you
in a conversation about the core concepts of our society. And I
hope, Judge, that you will discuss these matters with us more in
                                      39

terms of principles and precedents, and more in terms of desires
and doctrine.

  The American people care about these concepts. They are not
just debated in law journals. For example, as television brings vio-
lence into our homes, we agonize over the impact it has on our chil-
dren, the damage it does to their values and to their view of re-
ality, and wonder how we can reduce it without threatening the
constitutional promises of free speech.

  As gangs roam our streets and create fear in our communities,
we debate balancing the rights of individuals with the responsibil-
ity of the police to protect civil order. As new civil and voting rights
laws are proposed, we struggle to correct discrimination of the past
without creating a newly disenfranchised class.

  These and other issues invite all Americans to struggle with the
dilemmas of democracy, and if we can discuss these issues today
with candor, then I believe we will have a conversation the Amer-
ican people will profit from--and perhaps, Judge Ginsburg, the
type of stimulating conversation that you spoke of in the Rose Gar-
den. And so we welcome you before this committee, and we look
forward to our discussion with you.

   [The prepared statement of Senator Kohl follows:]

                                   PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR KOHL

   Judge Ginsburg, last month President Clinton announced that he would nominate
you to serve on the Supreme Court. At the Rose Garden ceremony, you told the
President you "look[ed] forward to stimulating weeks this summer." I assume you
were referring to the confirmation process; let's hope we don't disappoint you.

   Although the Constitution is silent on what standard to apply in evaluating a
nominee, you have provided some useful guidance. You have noted that "[i]n an ap-
pointment to the United States Supreme Court, the Senate comes second, but is not
secondary." I agree. And as a member of this Committee, I have developed my own
criteria for judgement.

   First, I look for a nominee of exceptional character, competence and integrity. You
clearly have that--as an honored student, an effective advocate and a distinguished
appellate judge.

   But I am struck by more than your professional honors. I am impressed by your
dedication to the principles that you not only talked about, but lived. For example,
you didn't just resign from discriminatory clubs, you also refused to join them in

   "Under our constitutional system, courts stand against any winds that blow as ha-
vens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak,
outnumbered, or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public ex-
citement."

   In other words, the courts are places for "doing justice," not just giving logic to
the law.

   Judge, you are not a stealth nominee, your record is clear, and there is little oppo-
sition to your confirmation. In fact, conventional wisdom has you all-but-confirmed
already. Even so, the Senate should not act as a rubber stamp.

   The President is asking us to entrust you with an immense amount of power. Be-
fore we decide to give it to you, we need to know what is in your heart and what
is in your mind. We don't have a right to know in advance how you will rule on

cases which will come before you. But we do need--and we deserve--to know what
you think about the fundamental issues that surround these cases.

  Today we begin a public discussion, which is the only opportunity we will have--
on behalf of the American people--to engage in a conversation with you about the
core concepts of our society. And I hope, Judge, that you will discuss these matters
with us more in terms of principles than precedents, more in terms of desires than
doctrine.

  The American people care about these concepts. They are not just reviewed in law
journals. As violence flickers across our TV screens, we think about our responsibil-
ity to children and our pledge to protect free speech. As gangs roam our streets and
create fear in our communities, we debate balancing the rights of individuals with
the responsibility of the police to protect civil order. As new civil and voting rights
laws are proposed, we struggle to correct discrimination of the past without creating
a newly disenfranchised class.

  These issues invite all Americans to struggle with the dilemmas of Democracy.
  And if we discuss these issues with candor, I believe we will have a conversation
the American people will profit from. And perhaps, Judge Ginsburg, the type of
"stimulating" conversation you spoke of in the Rose Garden.
  I welcome you before the Committee, and I look forward to our discussion.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Now I would like to recognize the distinguished Senator from
California, Senator Feinstein.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR FEINSTEIN

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge Ginsburg.
  For me, this is a very special opportunity, because while several
of my colleagues spoke of the fact that they have been present dur-
ing many of these hearings, for myself and Senator Moseley-Braun,
this is our first. And it is no coincidence that, as our first, it is
someone such as yourself.
  We are contemporaries, Judge, and many women of our genera-
tion struggled against significant odds to educate themselves and
to balance career and family. To be honest, though, until I began
to prepare for these hearings, I really didn't realize the depth and
the extent to which you have played a very critical role in breaking
down the barriers that have barred women from public and private
sectors for centuries. So now I know just how really fitting and
proper and how significant this vote is going to be for me. And I
want to thank President Clinton for nominating you.
  I noted, for example, that as one of only 9 women in a class of
400 at Harvard, you were asked by the dean to justify taking a
place in the class that otherwise would have gone to a man. That
despite graduating at the top of your law school class, only two law
firms in the entire city of New York offered you second interviews,
and neither offered you a job. And that even after you became a
litigator, you were given sex discrimination cases to handle, be-
cause they were viewed at the time as women's work.
  You met each of these challenges and indignities and, no doubt,
many more, Judge Ginsburg, with intellect, with determination,
and grace. And not only did you justify your admission to law
school, but you blazed a trail that thousands of women have fol-
lowed.
  Decades later, asked to identify the most significant jurists of his
time, the same dean who had begrudged your matriculation at
Harvard named you and the great Thurgood Marshall. The rest of
                                      41

your story is quite literally history, the history of modern gender
discrimination law.

  As the founder and director of the ACLU women's rights project,
you brought virtually every major sex discrimination case before
the Supreme Court in the 1970's. From the very first case that you
argued and won, as was spoken by Senator Leahy, Frontiero v.
Richardson, your work has changed the constitutional rules of the
road forever.

  In Frontiero,the Court struck down as "inherently suspect" a law
based on gender, and, for the first time in history, established a
new and tough test to which all future gender-based statutes would
be subjected.

  As I know from my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, and I
know she will appreciate it, Frontiero fittingly was decided pre-
cisely 100 years after the Supreme Court upheld in Bradwell v. Il-
linois that State's refusal to admit a woman to the practice of law.

  In Bradwell, the Supreme Court wrote: "Man is, or should be,
woman's protector and defender. The natural and proper timidity
and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for
many of the occupations of civil life." Accordingly, the Court con-
cluded, "The harmony * * * of interests and views which belong,
or should belong to the family institution, is repugnant to the idea
of a woman adopting a distinct and independent career from that
of her husband." What a long way we have come in this Nation.

  It took a century, though, to extract from the Court inFrontiero
a new test of constitutionality for statutes based on gender, and it
took an extraordinary woman to do it.

  Incredibly, you prevailed, as has been said, in five of the six
cases that you personally argued before the Court, winning in the
process equal treatment under the law for both women and men in
the administration of estates, receipt of Social Security benefits,
availability of tax exemptions, and jury service. In the process, you
improved the lives of virtually millions of Americans.

  In conclusion, for the intellect and dedication to thrive in hostile
academic environments, laying the groundwork for thousands of
women, including your daughter and mine, who is today a lawyer,
to follow; for the courage to persevere, with your husband's active
participation, in pursuit of a life in the law, and perhaps most of
all, for the fruits of that life as a litigator and a jurist.

  I want to thank you, Judge Ginsburg, both for all that you have
done, and as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court, for all that you
have yet to do.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Another distinguished new member of the committee, Senator
Moseley-Braun.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MOSELEY-BRAUN

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg and to your family, welcome.
  Mr. Chairman, I am truly honored to have the opportunity to
participate in these hearings. One of a Senator's most solemn re-
sponsibilities is the duty to offer advice and consent on the nomina-
tion of a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. One of the most pre-
                                              42

cious privileges an American citizen can have is to play a role in
that process.

  Indira Gandhi once said that if you study history, you will find
that where women have risen, that country attained a high posi-
tion, and whenever they remained dormant, that country slipped
back.

  Regrettably, history teaches us that many obstacles have been
placed in the way of progress for women in this country. Judge
Ginsburg's own personal history, including being rejected for em-
ployment by leading law firms and by the very Court to which she
is nominated today, demonstrated vividly the nature of gender dis-
crimination in this country's very recent past. Now, in 1993, thanks
in no small part to Judge Ginsburg's efforts as an advocate for
women, many--but not all--of the formal legal obstacles to the ad-
vancement of women have been eliminated by legislative action
and by judicial decisions.

  As has been pointed out before, today marks only the second
time in our Nation's history that a woman has appeared before the
Senate Judiciary Committee as a nominee to the Supreme Court.
It is also the first time that any woman, let alone two, has sat as
a member of this all-important body.

  Two years ago, I watched Senate confirmation hearings on the
television from back home in Illinois with a sense of helplessness
and exclusion. Our democracy once again responded and the people
of Illinois and of California, I might add, have given us the unique
privilege of participating here today.

  This is the greatest country in the world, and I believe the U.S.
Constitution to be the finest exposition of democratic principles
ever written.

  I make these statements, Mr. Chairman, fully aware of the fact
that, in its original form, the Constitution included neither this
Senator as an American of African descent, nor our distinguished
nominee as a woman in its vision of a democratic society.

  But the greatness of the Constitution lies in the fact that it is
a living document. Or, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said,
a declaration of intent regarding America's unlimited potential, a
document that, through an often painful process of amendment and
interpretation, has broadened its reach to extend to the previously
excluded its promise of equality and justice for all.

  Over the years, the Supreme Court played a glorious role in that
process. It was the Justices of our Supreme Court in their bold,
independent, and faithful interpretations of our living Constitution,
who outlawed racial segregation in our schools, guaranteed indi-
gent criminal defendants the right to counsel, brought wiretapping
within the restrictions of the fourth amendment, demanded free-
dom of speech, and recognized a woman's fundamental right to con-
trol her reproductive destiny.

  In some of the most difficult areas of our history, the Supreme
Court has shown the courage to give life to the promise of the Con-
stitution. It seems to me that a central issue of our time is whether
that courage has been lost to timidity and partisan politics.

  It is troubling to me, Mr. Chairman, that the Court's general ap-
proach to constitutional interpretation--the willingness of some re-
cent nominees to embrace the jurisprudence of so-called strict con-
                                              43

struction and original intent--all too often has resulted in a narrow
reading of the Constitution that has curtailed, rather than ex-
panded, individual rights and has left those who are not rich or
powerful or privileged with fewer and fewer rights and less and
less liberty. Regular working men and women, ordinary people, can
no longer be sure that the Supreme Court will be their champion
of last resort.

  All of the conversations that we have heard today about judicial
philosophy boil down to this: Can the people be secure that this
nominee will be a champion of their liberties, a jurist committed
to the rule of law in the service of society, someone wiling to see
our living Constitution as a declaration of intent?

  Over the next few days, this committee will have the opportunity
to explore some of the most complicated doctrines of constitutional
law with this nominee, a brilliant jurist and legal scholar. These
discussions are designed to illuminate Judge Ginsburg's judicial
philosophy and temperament.

  But even as we engage in what sometimes becomes a highly
technical dialog, Mr. Chairman, let us never forget that the Su-
preme Court does not belong to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
nor to this country's 800,000 lawyers, nor even to the 9 distin-
guished Justices themselves.

  Mr. Chairman, the Court belongs to the American people, and
the Court belongs to the American people for one very simple, yet
profound reason, because the Constitution belongs to the American
people.

  Judge Ginsburg, in your very eloquent remarks in accepting the
President's nomination, you said that you hoped to work "to the
best of my ability for the advancement of law in the service of soci-
ety."

  I salute your aspirations, but I also hope that you will bring
more than just your ability, and it is prodigious, based on all of
your work and writings so far, but bring more than just your abil-
ity to the High Court. I hope you will also bring your heart, your
history, and your humanity. Because on this historic occasion, I
can't help but recall the words of one distinguished American jurist
who I believe is personally known to you, who said: "I often wonder
whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitutions,
upon laws, and upon courts. These are false hopes. Believe me,
these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women.
When it dies there, no constitution, no law, and no court can save
it." You know that was Judge Learned Hand who said that.

  This great Nation is about to entrust its Constitution, its laws,
and its highest court to you, Judge Ginsburg, and I say that with-
out prejudging the outcome of this nomination--kind of. [Laugh-
ter.]

  So I hope that liberty and equality and opportunity lie within
your heart, because the hopes of millions of Americans depend on
it. And if liberty and equality and the love of the law live in your
heart, then the President and this committee and the American
people will have made the right choice.

  It is my hope, Judge Ginsburg, that you will pick up the mantle
of Justices Brennan and Marshall, and that you will once again
                                              44

give voice within the Court to the aspirations and hopes of the for-
gotten members of our society.

  As a member of the Supreme Court, you will have a historic
chance to nurture our living Constitution, and I use that word de-
liberately. In so doing, you will serve the people of this great Na-
tion. Your rise to this position will, therefore, be our country's gain
and we will all be the better for it.

  I again would like to extend my congratulations to you. I look
forward to the substantive part of the hearings and very much wel-
come you and your family to this hearing today.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Moseley-Braun follows:]

                         PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR MOSELEY-BRAUN

  Mr. Chairman, I am truly honored to have the opportunity to participate in these

under our precious Constitution. Regular working men and women can no longer
be sure that the Supreme Court will be their champion of last resort.

  It is time for the Court to embark upon a bold new era, Judge Ginsburg. It is
time for a new vision.

President, this committee, and the American people have made the right choice.

  It is my hope, Judge Ginsburg, that you will pick up the mantle of Justices Bren-
nan and Marshall and that you will once again give voice within the Court to the
aspirations and hopes of the forgotten members of our society.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well stated, Senator. I thank you very much.
  Let me take one brief moment to explain how Senator Hatch and
I have concluded we will pursue the schedule for the remainder of
the day. Very briefly, I will ask Judge Ginsburg to rise and be
sworn and introduce her family to us, and then invite her to make
an opening statement.
  At the conclusion of that statement, we will recess for lunch.
There have been five votes ordered to be voted in succession begin-
ning at 2:15 this afternoon, so we will not reconvene the hearings
until 3:15.
  At 3:15, when we reconvene, I have a very brief statement of less
than a couple minutes on process, how the remainder of the hear-
ing will be conducted from a procedural standpoint, and I will
begin the first round of questions. Each Senator will be given an
opportunity to have an exchange with the witness, the nominee, up
to 30 minutes, at which time we will conclude the questioning of
that Senator. We will not have an opportunity to have every Sen-
ator ask their first round of questions today.
  It is my intention to have the hearings recess approximately at
6:30, and we will reconvene then at 10 o'clock on Wednesday morn-
ing, picking up with whoever was the next questioner in line. So
that is how we will proceed from a schedule standpoint.
  Judge, I now ask you to stand with me and be sworn: Judge, do
you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
  Judge GINSBURG. I do, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO BE ASSOCI-
  ATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
  STATES

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, now you know, after hearing the click of
all those cameras, why I am so popular with the camera persons
here, because after lunch they will be banished from the well. I
love them all, but after you introduce your family, we are going to
take a moment to banish them from the well, so that when you
make your statement, you are unencumbered by their smiling faces
and the click of the camera.

  Would you be kind enough, Judge, to introduce your family to us.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have such a large family with me today, such an extended fam-
ily, not just the immediate people behind me who I will introduce,
but my friends, my law clerks, my secretaries. My heart is over-
flowing, because those are the people who have made it possible for
me to be here today.
  But let me start with my nephew, Peter Stiepleman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Stand up, so we may all see you.
  Judge GINSBURG. My brother-in-law, Ed Stiepleman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome.
  Judge GINSBURG. My wonderful sister-in-law, Claire Stiepleman.
  And one of my wonderful law clerks who is representing all the
rest, Al Cacozza.
  My life's partner for 39 years, Martin Ginsburg.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome. Welcome.
  Judge GINSBURG. And my son from the great State of Chicago,
James Ginsburg.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is what most Chicagoans think, that it is
a State.
  Judge GINSBURG. And his very special friend, Lisa Brauston.
  The CHAIRMAN. Lisa.
  Judge GINSBURG. And my incredible daughter, Jane Ginsburg
and Clara.
  The CHAIRMAN. Clara, you deserve an award so far today.
  Judge GINSBURG. She sure does, and, you know, people think I
am very serious and sober as a judge, and so when I had all you
people taking photographs of me in the White House, people were
trying to get me to smile, and they said think of Clara.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have Clara smiling.
  Judge GINSBURG. Then my grandson, Paul Spera. I must tell you
that, in preparation for these hearings, I have read briefing books,
opinion books, law reviews, but there is no book in the world that
means as much to me as this one. This is Paul's book. It says, "My
Grandma is Very, Very Special," by Paul Spera. I thank you, Paul,
for this wonderful book.
  The CHAIRMAN. I will tell you, Paul, the handwriting is good, the
pictures are beautiful and you don't need a publisher. [Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. It ends with a map of the United States of
America.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS Senator Kennedy just said, he hopes your
teacher is listening to this.
  Judge GINSBURG. And my son-in-law, George T. Spera, Jr.
  The CHAIRMAN. George.
                                              47

  Judge GINSBURG. And Christine, au pair from Belgium, who has
been taking such wonderful care of the children.

  Then, on behalf of my cousins who I reckon by the dozen, Ste-
phen Hess.

  The CHAIRMAN. Stephen, welcome.
  You have quite a family and we welcome you all here today. It
is obviously a very proud moment for you, and this is a proud mo-
ment for the photographers, because they get to stand and be seen
on television as they walk out of the well. [Laughter.]
  Thank you all. While they are moving, I want those listening to
understand I have not banished them from the hearing. They will
recede into the various places for which this room was designed to
be able to take their photographs, so they will continue to be able
to do their job.
  One of our colleagues who has just arrived has a statement, and
I will ask him whether or not he would prefer to deliver it before
or after the nominee makes her statement.
   Senator PRESSLER. I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I was in the Com-
merce Committee where I am the ranking member. We had an air
safety hearing, and I went through a long morning. I will greatly
summarize my statement. What do you prefer? What does the
chairman prefer?
   The CHAIRMAN. That is fine, Senator, you go right ahead, and
then we will go to your statement.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PRESSLER

   Senator PRESSLER. Welcome, Judge Ginsburg.
  You and I share something in common. This is our first U.S. Su-
preme Court confirmation hearing. I am very much impressed with
your legal background. You are a pioneer in the field of gender dis-
crimination, and your long line of legal victories has secured fun-
damental rights for both women and men.
   As stated in my conversation with you in my office several weeks
ago, I am very interested in how you would approach cases of par-
ticular interest to those of us living in the West. In my part of the
country, many legal controversies arise over how the law of the
land is applied to the use of the land. Environmental law, water
law, hunting and fishing rights, mineral rights, access to public
lands, private property rights, and cases and controversies arising
in Indian country--these are everyday issues that affect everyday
people living in the West. The Court's treatment of these issues
dramatically affects the way of life of the people of the West, in-
cluding my home State of South Dakota.
   I certainly am not looking for your position on these issues. After
all, you are not campaigning for an elected office. Nor are you a
political appointee. You have been nominated to be a Justice on the
highest court in the land.
   We on this committee and our colleagues in the Senate are
charged with the responsibility to confirm or not confirm you for
this high office. Some writers have commented that the Senate is
the last opportunity for the people to have a voice in determining
who shall sit on the Nation's highest Court.
   Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life. Once you are seat-
ed on the Court, the American people will have to coexist with Jus-
                                              48

tice Ginsburg for as long as you choose to stay, or God chooses to
keep you there.

  Before I cast my vote on your confirmation, I would like to know
how familiar you are with the issues I referenced, your inclination
to learn more about them, and how you intend to go about deciding
cases involving these issues. Indeed, on Indian country issues, I
note in the papers that even the State of Connecticut has a dispute
over Indian lands and Indian jurisdiction.

  Both Indians and non-Indians on or near reservations are eager
to resolve some of these issues, and many of them go to the Su-
preme Court. Through these specific issues, I hope to learn more
about your general approach to the basic principles of judging,
principles such as fairness and objectivity.

  There also are many issues that go to the Supreme Court regard-
ing hunting and fishing rights, such as on the Missouri River.
There are cases that go to the Supreme Court about the tribal
courts, which are quite different from the U.S. Federal district
courts. Indian cases significantly contribute to the work overload of
Federal judges in my State.

  In the course of the next few days, I hope we can have a dialogue
on issues of concern to the people in the West, but not only in the
West, but throughout the United States, because everyone is con-
cerned about these issues. And the Supreme Court ends up decid-
ing more of them than Congress, perhaps because Congress is un-
willing. Maybe I should criticize our own institution.

  In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent to be able to
submit the remainder of my statement for the record. I shall be
asking many questions on Indian country jurisdiction.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be entered in the
record. I thank you, Senator.

  [The prepared statement of Senator Pressler follows:]

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR PRESSLER

  Welcome, Judge Ginsburg. You and I share something in common--this is our
first U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearing. I look forward to them very much,
as I'm sure you do.

  Judge Ginsburg, you have a most impressive legal background. You are a pioneer
in the field of gender discrimination. Your long line of legal victories has secured
fundamental rights for both women and men. Your distinguished place in the annals
of American law already is secure.

  The volume of your writings is astounding. My staff has filled nearly three dozen
large three-ring binders to contain them. In reading your articles and decisions, one
receives an education on a wide range of legal subjects. I commend you for the pro-
lific contributions you have made to the law.

  As stated in my conversation with you in my office several weeks ago, I am very
interested in how you would approach cases of particular interest to those of us liv-
ing in the West. In my part of the country, many legal controversies arise over how
the law of the land is applied to the use of the land. Environmental law, water law,
hunting and fishing rights, mineral rights, access to public lands, private poverty
rights, and cases and controversies arising in Indian Country--these are everyday
issues that affect everyday people living in the West. The Court's treatment of these
issues dramatically affect the way of life of the people of the West, including my
home state of South Dakota.

  I certainly am not looking for your "position" on these issues. After all, you are
not campaigning for an elected office. Nor are you a political appointee. You have
been nominated to be a justice on the highest court of this land.

  We on this Committee and our colleagues in the Senate are charged with the re-
sponsibility to confirm or not confirm you for this high office. Some writers have
                                      49

commented that the Senate is the last opportunity for the people to have a voice
in determining who shall sit on the nation s highest court.

  Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. Once you are seated on the Court,
the American people will have to coexist with Justice Ginsburg for as long as you
choose to stay, or God chooses to keep you there. The people will have no say about
your tenure.

  Before I can cast my vote on your confirmation, I would like to know how familiar
you are with the issues I referenced, you inclination to learn more about them, and
how you intend to go about deciding cases involving these issues. Through these
specific issues, I hope to learn more about your general approach to the basic prin-
ciples of judging--principles such as fairness and objectivity.

  Over the course of the next few days, I hope we can have a dialogue on issues
of concern to people in the West. I believe we can learn from each other in the proc-
ess.

  Once again, welcome to this hearing. I look forward to your testimony.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, the floor is now yours. Again, welcome.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, and
other members of the committee.
  May I say first how much I appreciate the time committee mem-
bers took to greet me in the weeks immediately following the Presi-
dent's nomination. It was a particularly busy time for you, and I
thank you all the more for your courtesy.
  To Senator Moynihan, who has been at my side every step of the
way, a thousand thanks could not begin to convey my appreciation.
Despite the heavy demands on his time, during trying days of
budget reconciliation, he accompanied me on visits to Senate mem-
bers, he gave over his own desk for my use, he buoyed up my spir-
its whenever a lift was needed. In all, he served as the kindest,
wisest counselor a nominee could have.
  Senator D'Amato, from my great home State of New York, volun-
teered to join Senator Moynihan in introducing and sponsoring me,
and I am so grateful to him. I have had many enlightening con-
versations in Senate Chambers since June 14, but my visit with
Senator D'Amato was sheer fun.
  The CHAIRMAN. It always is. [Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. My children decided at an early age that moth-
er's sense of humor needed improvement. They tried to supply that
improvement, and kept a book to record their successes. The book
was called "Mommy Laughed." My visit with Senator D'Amato
would have supplied at least three entries for the "Mommy
Laughed" book.
  Representative Norton has been my professional colleague and
friend since days when we were still young. As an advocate of
human rights and fair chances for all people, Eleanor Holmes Nor-
ton has been as brave and as vigilant as she is brilliant. I am so
pleased that she was among my introducers, and so proud to be
one of Eleanor's constituents.
  Most of all, the President's confidence in my capacity to serve as
a Supreme Court Justice is responsible for the proceedings about
to begin. There are no words to tell him what is in my heart. I can
say simply this: If confirmed, I will try in every way to justify his
faith in me.
  I am, as you know from my responses to your questionnaire, a
Brooklynite, born and bred--a first-generation American on my fa-
ther's side, barely second-generation on my mother's. Neither of my
parents had the means to attend college, but both taught me to
love learning, to care about people, and to work hard for whatever
                                      50
I wanted or believed in. Their parents had the foresight to leave
the old country, when Jewish ancestry and faith meant exposure
to pogroms and denigration of one's human worth. What has be-
come of me could happen only in America. Like so many others, I
owe so much to the entry this Nation afforded to people yearning
to breathe free.

  I have had the great fortune to share life with a partner truly
extraordinary for his generation, a man who believed at age 18
when we met, and who believes today, that a woman's work,
whether at home or on the job, is as important as a man's. I at-
tended law school in days when women were not wanted by most
members of the legal profession. I became a lawyer because Marty
and his parents supported that choice unreservedly.

  I have been deeply moved by the outpouring of good wishes re-
ceived in recent weeks from family, neighbors, camp mates, class-
mates, students at Rutgers and Columbia, law-teaching colleagues,
lawyers with whom I have worked, judges across the country, and
many women and men who do not know me. That huge, spirit-lift-
ing collection shows that for many of our people, an individual's sex
is no longer remarkable or even unusual with regard to his or her
qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court.

  Indeed, in my lifetime, I expect to see three, four, perhaps even
more women on the High Court Bench, women not shaped from the
same mold, but of different complexions. Yes, there are miles in
front, but what a distance we have traveled from the day President
Thomas Jefferson told his Secretary of State: 'The appointment of
women to [public] office is an innovation for which the public is not
prepared." "Nor," Jefferson added, "am I."

  The increasingly full use of the talent of all of this Nation's peo-
ple holds large promise for the future, but we could not have come
to this point--and I surely would not be in this room today--with-
out the determined efforts of men and women who kept dreams of
equal citizenship alive in days when few would listen. People like
Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Harriet Tubman
come to mind. I stand on the shoulders of those brave people.

  Supreme Court Justices are guardians of the great charter that
has served as our Nation's fundamental instrument of government
for over 200 years. It is the oldest written constitution still in force
in the world. But the Justices do not guard constitutional rights
alone. Courts share that profound responsibility with Congress, the
President, the States, and the people. Constant realization of a
more perfect Union, the Constitution's aspiration, requires the
widest, broadest, deepest participation on matters of government
and government policy.

  One of the world's greatest jurists, Judge Learned Hand, said, as
Senator Moseley-Braun reminded us, that the spirit of liberty that
imbues our Constitution must lie first and foremost in the hearts
of the men and women who compose this great Nation. Judge Hand
defined that spirit, in a way I fully embrace, as one which is not
too sure that it is right, and so seeks to understand the minds of
other men and women and to weigh the interests of others along-
side its own without bias. The spirit Judge Learned Hand de-
scribed strives for a community where the least shall be heard and
                                      51
considered side by side with the greatest. I will keep that wisdom
in the front of my mind as long as I am capable of judicial service.

  Some of you asked me during recent visits why I want to be on
the Supreme Court. It is an opportunity beyond any other for one
of my training to serve society. The controversies that come to the
Supreme Court, as the last judicial resort, touch and concern the
health and well-being of our Nation and its people. They affect the
preservation of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. Serving on
this Court is the highest honor, the most awesome trust, that can
be placed in a judge. It means working at my craft--working with
and for the law--as a way to keep our society both ordered and
free.

  Let me try to state in a nutshell how I view the work of judging.
My approach, I believe, is neither liberal nor conservative. Rather,
it is rooted in the place of the judiciary, of judges, in our demo-
cratic society. The Constitution's preamble speaks first of "We, the
People," and then of their elected representatives. The judiciary is
third in line and it is placed apart from the political fray so that
its members can judge fairly, impartially, in accordance with the
law, and without fear about the animosity of any pressure group.

  In Alexander Hamilton's words, the mission of judges is "to se-
cure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws."
I would add that the judge should carry out that function without
fanfare, but with due care. She should decide the case before her
without reaching out to cover cases not yet seen. She should be
ever mindful, as Judge and then Justice Benjamin Nathan Cardozo
said, "Justice is not to be taken by storm. She is to be wooed by
slow advances."

  We--this committee and I--are about to embark on many hours
of conversation. You have arranged this hearing to aid you in the
performance of a vital task, to prepare your Senate colleagues for
consideration of my nomination.

  The record of the Constitutional Convention shows that the dele-
gates had initially entrusted the power to appoint Federal judges,
most prominently Supreme Court Justices, not to the President,
but to you and your colleagues, to the Senate acting alone. Only
in the waning days of the Convention did the Framers settle on a
nomination role for the President and an advice and consent role
for the Senate.

  The text of the Constitution, as finally formulated, makes no dis-
tinction between the appointment process for Supreme Court Jus-
tices and the process for other offices of the United States, for ex-
ample, Cabinet officers. But as history bears out, you and Senators
past have sensibly considered appointments in relation to the ap-
pointee's task.

  Federal judges may long outlast the President who appoints
them. They may serve as long as they can do the job. As the Con-
stitution says, they may remain in office "during good Behaviour."
Supreme Court Justices, most notably, participate in shaping a
lasting body of constitutional decisions. They continuously confront
matters on which the Framers left things unsaid, unsettled, or un-
certain. For that reason, when the Senate considers a Supreme
Court nomination, the Senators are properly concerned about the
                                      52

nominee's capacity to serve the Nation, not just for the here and
now, but over the long term.

  You have been supplied, in the 5 weeks since the President an-
nounced my nomination, with hundreds of pages about me and
thousands of pages I have penned--my writings as a law teacher,
mainly about procedure; 10 years of briefs filed when I was a court-
room advocate of the equal stature of men and women before the
law; numerous speeches and articles on that same theme; 13 years
of opinions--counting the unpublished together with the published
opinions, well over 700 of them--all decisions I made as a member
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit;
several comments on the roles of judge and lawyers in our legal
system.

  That body of material, I know, has been examined by the com-
mittee with care. It is the most tangible, reliable indicator of my
attitude, outlook, approach, and style. I hope you will judge my
qualifications principally on that written record, a record spanning
34 years, and that you will find in that written record assurance
that I am prepared to do the hard work and to exercise the in-
formed, independent judgment that Supreme Court decisionmaking
entails.

  I think of these proceedings much as I do of the division between
the written record and briefs, on the one hand, and oral argument
on the other hand, in appellate tribunals. The written record is by
far the more important component in an appellate court's decision-
making, but the oral argument often elicits helpful clarifications
and concentrates the judges' minds on the character of the decision
they are called upon to make.

  There is, of course, this critical difference. You are well aware
that I come to this proceeding to be judged as a judge, not as an
advocate. Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it
would be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative
chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme Court
may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here what I would
say and how I would reason on such questions, I would act injudi-
ciously.

  Judges in our system are bound to decide concrete cases, not ab-
stract issues. Each case comes to court based on particular facts
and its decision should turn on those facts and the governing law,
stated and explained in light of the particular arguments the par-
ties or their representatives present. A judge sworn to decide im-
partially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not
only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would dis-
play disdain for the entire judicial process.

  Similarly, because you are considering my capacity for independ-
ent judging, my personal views on how I would vote on a publicly
debated issue were I in your shoes--were I a legislator--are not
what you will be closely examining. As Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes counseled, "[O]ne of the most sacred duties of a judge is
not to read [her] convictions into [the Constitution]." I have tried
and I will continue to try to follow the model Justice Holmes set
in holding that duty sacred.

  I see this hearing, as I know you do, as a grand opportunity once
again to reaffirm that civility, courtesy and mutual respect prop-
                                              53

erly keynote our exchanges. Judges, I am mindful, owe the elected
branches--the Congress and the President--respectful consider-
ation of how court opinions affect their responsibilities. And I am
heartened by legislative branch reciprocal sensitivity. As one of you
said 2 months ago at a meeting of the Federal Judges Association,
"We in Congress must be more thoughtful and more deliberate in
order to enable judges to do their job more effectively."

  As for my own deportment or, in the Constitution's words, "good
Behaviour," I prize advice received on this nomination from a dear
friend, Frank Griffin, a recently retired Justice of the Supreme
Court of Ireland. Justice Griffin wrote: "Courtesy to and consider-
ation for one's colleagues, the legal profession, and the public are
among the greatest attributes a judge can have."

  It is fitting, as I conclude this opening statement, to express my
deep respect for, and abiding appreciation to Justice Byron R.
White for his 31 years and more of fine service on the Supreme
Court. In acknowledging his colleagues' good wishes on the occa-
sion of his retirement, Justice White wrote that he expects to sit
on U.S. courts of appeals from time to time, and so to be a
consumer of, instead of a participant in, Supreme Court opinions.
He expressed a hope shared by all lower court judges. He hoped
"the Supreme Court's mandates will be clear and crisp, leaving as
little room as possible for disagreement about their meaning." If
confirmed, I will take that counsel to heart and strive to write
opinions that both "get it right" and "keep it tight."

  Thank you for your patience.

Ginsburg follow:]

                                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF JUDGE GINSBURG

  Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, and other members of the Committee, may I say
first how much I appreciate the time Committee members took to greet me in the
weeks immediately following the President's nomination. It was a particularly busy
time for you, and I thank you all the more for your courtesy.

  To Senator Moynihan, who has been at my side every step of the way, a thousand
thanks could not begin to convey my appreciation. Despite the heavy demands on
his time, during trying days of budget reconciliation, he accompanied me on visits
to Senate members, gave over his own desk for my use, buoyed up my spirits when-
ever a lift was needed, and served as the kindest, wisest counselor a nominee could
have.

  Senator D'Amato volunteered to join Senator Moynihan in introducing and spon-
soring me, and I am so grateful to him. I have had many enlightening conversations
in Senate chambers since June 14, but my visit with Senator D'Amato was sheer
fun. My children decided at en early age that their mother's sense of humor needed
improvement. They tried to supply that improvement, and kept a book to record
their successes; the book was called: "Mommy Laughed." My visit with Senator
D'Amato would have supplied at least three entries for the "Mommy Laughed" book.

  Representative Norton has been a professional colleague and friend since days
when we were very young. As an advocate of human rights and fair chances for all
people, she has been as courageous and vigilant as she is intelligent. I am so
pleased that she is among my introducers, and so proud to be one of Eleanor's con-
stituents.

materials and it is beyond my resources to collect and compile
them.

issued by several of the listed groups during the period of my

American Jewish Congress.

        As a General Counsel to the American Civil Liberties
Union, 1973-April 1980, I was informed of lobbying
activities in which the ACLU engaged and, from tine to tine,
within the organization, expressed ay views. However, I did
not participate personally in legislation-related efforts as
a representative of the ACLU, and retain no record
compilation or index responsive to this question. While
some of the other organizations in which I participated
until 1980 nay have engaged in lobbying, I did not
participate personally in such activity and have no memory
of what that activity nay have been.

         The "other memberships" I have held since my
appointment in 1980 entail no lobbying activities. All of
the organizations listed in this category, I believe,
maintain full records. Further information is available
from the Director or President of the respective
organizations. If additional detail is needed from me, I
will attempt to obtain and supply it on request.

        Thank you very much.

14. Public Office; State (chronologically) any public offices
          you have held, including judicial offices, including the
          terms of service and whether such positions were elected or
          appointed. State (chronologically) any unsuccessful
          candidacies for elective public office.

                    I have never been a candidate for elected public
                    office. I have held only one public office: United
                    States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia
                    Circuit, appointed June 1980.

15. Legal Career:

a. Describe chronologically your law practice and
          experience after graduation from law school including:

          1. whether you served as clerk to a judge, and if so,
                    the name of the judge, the court, and the dates of
                    the period you were a clerk;

      "*" 2. whether you practiced alone, and if so, the
                    addresses and dates;

          3. the dates, names and addresses of law firms or
                    offices, companies or governmental agencies with
                    which you have been connected, and the nature of
                    your connection with each;

          I served as a law clerk to Hon. Edmund L. Palmieri, United
States District Judge, Southern District of New York, from August
1959 to August 1961. From September 1961 to August 1963, I
served first as a Research Associate, then as Associate Director
of Columbia Law School's Project on International Procedure. In
those positions, I studied and wrote about Sweden's procedural
system and the practices of Scandinavian countries with respect
to international judicial assistance. I also participated in
Project work regarding other countries and legislative
improvements to enhance international cooperation in litigation.

         From 1963 until 1980, law teaching was my primary
                                     82

                                                                                               1-25

occupation. I was on the faculty of Rutgers -- The State
University, School of Law (Newark, N.J.) from 1963 to 1972 and on
the law faculty of Colunbia University School of Law from 1972
until 1980. As a law teacher, ay principal classroom and
scholarly work related to civil procedure (emphasizing federal
courts), conflict of laws, and constitutional law.

        Since June 1980, I have served as a United States Circuit
Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.

b. l. What has been the general character of your law
                practice, dividing it into periods with dates if
                its character has changed over the years?

        2. Describe your typical former clients and the
                areas, if any, in which you have specialized.

        Apart from occasional consultation concerning Swedish law,
federal procedure and jurisdiction, my practice was pro bono in
association with the American Civil Liberties Union. Clients
represented were men and women of diverse ethnic origin and
economic circumstances pursuing claims for equal justice under
the law.

c. l. Did you appear in court frequently, occasionally,
               or not at all? If the frequency of your
               appearances in court varied, describe each such
               variance, giving dates.

      ^ 1971 until 1979, I appeared regularly in appellate
proceedings in the U.S. Supreme Court and in other federal court
proceedings. Prior to 1971, I regularly observed but did not
participate in court proceedings. Experience in court prior to
1971 included two years as a federal district court law clerk
(involving attendance at a wide variety of trial and other
proceedings) and attendance at diverse proceedings in the United
States and Sweden in connection with comparative procedure
studies.

        2. What percentage of these appearances was in:

                        (a) federal courts;

                        (b) state courts of record;

                        (c) other courts.

       All of my courtroom appearances as attorney for a party*were
in federal tribunals. I was the author of amicjis cjulafi briefs
filed in state courts and was regularly consulted by ACLU
                                     83

                                                                                                          1-26

attorneys regarding their preparation of state court briefs and
pleadings.

         3. What percentage of your litigation was:

                           (a) civil;

                           (b) criminal.

         Civil cases represented approximately 90% of my litigation
efforts.

         4. State the number of cases in courts of record you
                  tried to verdict or judgment (rather than
                  settled), indicating whether you were sole
                  counsel, chief counsel, or associate counsel.

         5. What percentage of these trials was:

                           (a) jury;

                           (b) non-jury.

         4. and 5. I initiated as chief or supervising counsel
several federal district court actions. First instance cases in
which I acted as sole or supervising counsel were resolved,
successfully, at the pre-trial stage. Nearly all were three-
judge federal district court actions decided, after pre-trial
proceedings, by summary judgment; thereafter, I served in five of
these cases as attorney for appellees in the U.S. Supreme Court.
All proceedings in which I served as sole or chief counsel were
non-jury cases.

       *I had significant appellate experience in some fifteen cases
in which I served as attorney for a party. I was the sole or
principal author of several amicus curiae briefs filed in the
U.S. Supreme Court and other appellate tribunals.

(1) Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971).

        Summary and disposition -- Idaho statute ociaring, as
        between persons "equally entitled" to administer a
        decedent's estate, "males must be preferred to
        females," held unconstitutional.

        Significance -- Turning point decision, first occasion
        on which Supreme Court held a gender-based
        classification inconsistent with the equal protection
        principle.

        Party represented -- Appellant Sally Reed.

        Nature of participation -- Principal author of Brief
        and Reply Brief for Appellant.

        (1973).

        tax deduction Internal Revenue Code provided only for
        daughters and married sons.

        Significance -- Fraternal twin to Reed, this .' jcision
        marks the only occasion, at least before 1980, in which
        a provision of the Internal Revenue Code has been
        declared unconstitutional.

        Party represented -- Appellant in Tenth Circuit,
        Respondent in Supreae Court, Charles E. Moritz. (Mr.
        Moritz appeared pro se in the Tax Court.)

(3) Struck v. Secretary of Defense, cert, granted, 409 U.S.
        947, judgment vacated, 409 U.S. 1071 (1972).

        Summary and disposition -- Rule mandating discharge of
        pregnant Air Force officers challenged. After Supreme
        Court granted certiorari and the Brief for Petitioner
        was filed, Air Force agreed to retain Capt. Struck and
        to change the rule. As a result, the judgment below,
        which had upheld the rule, was vacated.

        Significance -- The outcome in Struck indicated the
        beginning stage of change in the direction of more
        equitable employment practices regarding childbearing
        w"""n.

        Party represented -- Petitioner Capt. Susan B. Struck.

       Nature of participation -- I consulted with local
       counsel during proceedings below, and was principal
                              86

                                                                                                1-29

        author of all Supreme Court papers: Petition for
        Certiorari, Reply and Supplemental Briefs before
        certiorari was granted, and Brief for Petitioner after
        certxurari was granted.

        U.S. 44 (1974), and Crawford v. Cushman, 531 F.2d 1114
         (2d Cir. 1976), later dispositions in the same area. I
        co-authored the Petition for Certiorari on the basis of
        which the Court reversed the judgment in Turner, and
        co-authored the Brief for Appellant in Crawford.]

        Co-counsel -- Joel M. Gora, Brooklyn Law School, 250
        Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201 (tel. 718/625-

(4) Trontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973).

        Summary and disposition -- Federal statutes granting
        fringe benefits to married male members of the military
        but not to similarly situated married female members of
        the military held unconstitutional.

        Significance -- The classification overturned reflected
        the most pervasive gender line in the law: four
        Justices subscribed to a plurality opinion declaring
        sex a "suspect" criterion.

        Parties represented -- Appellants Sharron and Joseph
        Frontiero; amicus curiae American Civil Liberties
        Union.

       Nature of participation -- I was principal author of
        the Jurisdictional Statement, the Brief Amicus Curiae
        for the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Joint
        Reply Brief for Appellants and Amicus Curiae; I divided
        oral argument with attorney for the Frontieros, Joseph
        Levin, Southern Poverty Law Center, Montgomery, AL.

       Co-Counsel -- (then) ACLU legal director, Melvin L.
       Wulf, Beldock, Levine & Hoffman, 99 Park Avenue, New
        York, NY 10016-1502 (tel. 212/490-0400).

       Counsel for Secretary of Defense Richardson -- (then)
       Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold, Jones, Day, Reaves
        & Pogue, Metropolitan Square, 1450 G Street, N.W.,
       Washington, D.C. 20005-2088 (202/879-3939).
                                  87

                                                                                                     1-30

    (5) Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974).
            Summary and disposition -- Court upheld against
             constitutional challenge a Florida law, dating from
             1885, providing a real property tax exemption for
            widows (also the blind and the totally disabled) but
            not widowers.
            Significance -- Indicated that gender-based
            distinctions would withstand equal protection
            objections if the Court perceived them as compensating
            women for disadvantages encountered in economic
            endeavor.
             [A later decision, Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268 (1979),
            clarifies that even an apparently benign or
            compensatory gender-based classification should attract
            close review. I co-authored the brief amicus curiae
            in Orr.]
            Party represented -- Appellant Mel Kahn.
            Nature of participation -- I undertook representation
            of widower Kahn after the Supreme Court noted probable
            jurisdiction. I wrote the Brief and Reply Brief for
            Appellant, and presented oral argument.
            Co-counsel -- William Hoppe, Hoppe, Backmeyer & Stokes,
            66 W. Flagler Street, Concord Building, 2nd floor,

            305/358-9900); (then) Assistant Attorney .General Sydney
            H. McKenzie, III (argued), 3769 Suffolk Drive,
            Talahassee, FL (904/893/3882).

    (6) Healy v.~Edwards, 363 F.Supp. 1110 (E.D. La. 1973),
            vacated for determination of mootness, 421 U.S. 772
            (1975), in Supreme Court, companion to and argued in
            tandem with Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975).
            Summary and disposition -- Louisiana law exempting from
            jury service all women except those who volunteer to
            serve held unconstitutional.
            Significance -- Established that women count in

75-974 O - 94 -- 4
                               88

                                                                                                 1-31

        determining whether lists from which jurors are drawn
        represent a fair cross-section of the community.

        Parties represented -- Plaintiffs below (three classes:
         female civil litigants; female potential jurors; male
         potential jurors), Appellees in Supreme Court.

        Nature of participation -- I was chief counsel from the
         initiation of proceedings in the district court through
        the Supreme Court presentation. With assistance from
        New Orleans counsel, I prepared district court
        pleadings, motions, and briefs and presented oral
         argument before the three-judge court. On appeal, I
        wrote the Notion to Affirm and the Brief for Appellees,
        and presented oral argument. I consulted with the
        attorney in Taylor in connection with the preparation
        of his brief and oral argument.

        Judges by whom case heard and decided -- In district
        court, D.J. Rubin (convening Judge), C.J. Wisdom, D.J.
        West.

        Co-counsel -- George M. Strickler, Jr., last address:
        LeBlanc and Strickler, One Poydras Plaza, Suite 1075,
        639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70113 (tel. 504/581-
        4346).

        Counsel for Hon. Edwin Edwards (Governor of Louisiana)
        -- (then) Attorney General William J. Guste, Jr., 639
        Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70133 (tel. 504/568-

        1973), aft'd, 420 U.S. 636 (1975).

        Summary and disposition -- Widowed father who cared
        personally for his infant held entitled to the same
        child-in-care social security benefits accorded by
        federal -statute to widowed mothers.

        Significance -- The first of a series of decisions
        holding the social security accounts of female wage
        earners, to comport with equal protection, must
        generate the same family benefits as the accounts of
        male wage earners.

        Party represented -- Plaintiff in district court,
        Appellee in Supreme Court, Stephen C. Wiesenfeld.
                               89

                                                                                                 1-32

        Nature of participation -- I was chief counsel from the
        initiation of proceedings in the district court through
        Supreme Court presentation. I prepared district court
        pleadings, notions, and briefs, and presented oral
        argument before the three-judge court. On appeal, I
        wrote the Motion to Affirm and the Brief for Appellee,
        and presented oral argument.

        Judges by whom case heard and decided -- In district
        court, D.J. Fisher (convening Judge), C.J. Hunter, D.J.
        Whipple.

        Counsel for Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare
        -- In district court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernard

        Jones, Fulbright & Jaworski, 801 Pennsylvania Avenue,

(8) Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977).

        Summary and disposition -- Widowed male retiree held
        entitled to social security benefits under his wage-
        earning wife's account without regard to dependency.

        Significance -- The decision develops the principle
        advanced earlier in Frontiero and Wiesenfeld and
        explicitly applies a heightened equal protection review
        standard to gender-based classifications. [Substantial
        reliance was placed on Goldfarb and Wiesenfeld in
        Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76 (1979). I co-
        authored a brief amicus curiae in Westcott.]

        Party represented -- Appellee Leon Goldfarb.

       Nature of participation -- I was chief counsel, wrote
        the Motion to Affirm, Brief for Appellee and

       proceedings below. [Companion cases were Califano v.
       Jablon, 430 U.S. 294 (1977), summarily affirming 399 T\
        Supp. 118 (D. Md. 1975), and Califano v. Coffin, 430
       U.S. 924 (1977), dismissing appeal from 400 F. Supp.

         953 (D. D.C. 1975). I wrote the Motion to Affirm and
         the cross-Jurisdictional Statement in these cases, and
         was sole attorney in Coffin from the commencement of
         the action to final judgment.]

         Co-counsel -- Kathleen Peratis, 800 Third Avenue, New
         York, NY (tel. 212/355-3900).

         remanding 556 S.W.2d 11 (Mo. 1977).

        Summary and disposition -- Missouri law granting
        exemption from jury service to "any woman" held
        unconstitutional.

        Significance -- The decision develops the principle
        advanced earlier in Healy and Taylor and clarifies that
        substantial underrepresentation of women on jury panels
        is not compatible with the Constitution's fair cross-
        section requirement.

        Party represented -- Petitioner Billy Duren.

        Nature of participation -- I wrote the Brief and Reply
        Brief for Petitioner and divided oral argument with
        Missouri public defender.

        Co-counsel -- (then) Assistant Public Defender Lee M.

(10J Owens v. Brown, 455 F.Supp. 291 (D.D.C. 1978) (Judge
        Sirica).

        Summary and disposition -- Federal statute prohibiting
                               91

                                                                                                  1-34

         assignment of female personnel to duty on navy vessels
         other than hospital ships and transports held
         unconstitutional. No appeal was pursued by the
         Secretary of Defense.

         Significance -- The decision is an important step in
         opening doors to women seeking careers, educational and
         training opportunities in the military.

         Parties represented -- Plaintiffs, class of female Navy
         officers and enlisted personnel.

         Nature of participation -- I supervised development of
         the case by ACLU staff attorneys and co-authored the
         Brief in Support of Plaintiffs' Cross-Notion for
         Summary Judgment. I did not participate in oral

17. Legal Activities; Describe the most significant legal
         activities you have pursued, including significant
         litigation which did not progress to trial or legal matters
         that did not involve litigation. Describe fully the nature
         of your participation in these activities. Please list any
         clients or organizations from whom you performed lobbying
         activities and describe the lobbying activities you
         performed on behalf of such client(s). (Note: As to any
         facts requested in this question, please omit any
         information protected by the attorney-client privilege.)

         I count as the most significant legal activities I have
pursued my work in comparative law and toward the advancement of
equal opportunity and responsibility for women and men in all
fields of human endeavor.

         My interest in comparative law was sparked by my studies of
foreign judicial systems (principally in Sweden, also in Denmark,
Finland, and Norway) in the early 1960s. Several publications
resulted from those studies. I later served as an editor of the
American Journal of Comparative Law from 1966 until 1972, on
several Bar committees relating to comparative law, and.taught or
lectured at faculties in Austria, France, the Netherlands,
Sweden, and Taiwan. I have attended comparative law conferences
or exchanges in China, England, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Scotland, and Sweden.

        I had the good fortune to be able to devote my legal
training, in the 1970s, to educational and litigation efforts
aimed at improving the status of women in society and encouraging
men to contribute, as full partners, to family life,
particularly, to caring for children. During those years, I
taught courses and seminars, and supervised clinical programs, on
sex-based discrimination. Simultaneously, I helped to launch,
and then supervised, the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's
Rights Project, a -project in which men worked together with women
to overcome artificial barriers to equal opportunity for all
persons.

        I have not engaged in lobbying activities for any client or
organization.

18. Teaching; What courses have you taught? For each
        course, state the title, the institution at which you
        taught the course, the years in which you taught the
                                     93

                                                                                                          1-36

        course, and describe briefly the subject matter of the
        course and the major topics taught.

        At Rutgers -- The State University School of Law v..ewark), I
taught Civil Procedure (sometimes called Remedies) annually from
1963 until 1972. During my tenure there, I also taught Conflict
of Laws, Comparative Law and Procedure, Federal Courts, and Women
and the Law. As a visiting faculty member at New York University
School of Law in the Spring of 1968, I taught Conflict of Laws.
At Harvard Law School, in the Fall of 1971, I taught Women and
the Law. At Columbia University School of Law, from 1972 until
1980, I regularly taught Civil Procedure, Conflict of Laws, and
Sex-Based Discrimination, and also Constitutional Law.

        n . FINANCIAL DATA AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PUBLIC)

1. list sources, amounts and dates of all anticipated receipts from deferred income
         arrangements, stock options, uncompleted contracts and other future benefits
         which you expect to derive from previous business relationship;, professional
         services, firm memberships, former employers, client, or customers. Please
         describe the arrangements you have made to be compensated in the future for any
         financial or business interest

                 I have no anticipated future receipts, except that as a full-time officer of
                instruction at Columbia University until June 1980,1 was covered under the
                following retirement plan:

                          TIAA/CREF Annuity Plan for officers (membership
                          was automatic, contributions were made annually by
                          the University) and TIAA/CREF Supplemental
                          Retirement Annuity (voluntary contributions made
                          pursuant to a salary reduction agreement).

                 The accumulated balance in my TIAA/CREF account is shown on Schedule
                 D to the attached financial net worth statement.

                 I have no arrangements to be compensated in the future for any financial or
                 business interest.

2. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest, including the
     ^ procedure you will follow in determining these areas of concern. Identify the
        categories of litigation and financial arrangements mat are likely to present
        potential conflicts of interest during your initial service in the position to which
        you have ween nominated.

                 If confirmed, I would disqualify myself in any proceeding in which my
                 impartially might reasonably be questioned. I would decline to hear or
                 participate in any case with which I have served or participated, whether as
                 lawyer, judge, or in any other capacity. Similarly, I would decline to hear
                 or participate in any case with which another lawyer in my family is serving
                 or participating, or has served or participated, whether as lawyer, judge, or
                 in any other capacity.

                 Overall, I would seek to follow the letter and spirit of the Code of Conduct
                 for United States Judges (although it is not formally binding on members of
                 the United States Supreme Court), the Ernies Reform Act of 1989, 28
                            95

                            n-2

    U.S.C. 455, and all other relevant prescriptions. These standards, of
    course, do not compel disqualification on die basis of a jurist's views on
    legal principles or expressions concerning the law itself as distinguished
    from Application of die law to a particular matter. They do indicate,
    however, the obligations of a judge to exercise self-discipline, to reason
    dispassionately and to decide cases within the framework of the relevant
    legal rules. I would attempt diligently in all cases in which I may
    participate to meet these obligations.

    I am not aware of any category of litigation or any financial arrangement
    that is likely to present a potential conflict of interest during my service in
    the position to which I have been nominated.

3. Do you have any plans, commitments, or agreements to pursue outside
        employment, with or without compensation, during your service with the Court?
        If so, explain.

    I have no plans, commitments or agreements to pursue outside employment,

    with or without compensation, during my service with the Court. If it is

    fully consistent with all ethical standards for members of the federal

    judiciary, I may occasionally accept writing and lecture invitations from bar

    and community groups, universities, and similar institutions. I would do so

    only when there is no conflict with my duties and allegiances as an

    Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. I have undertaken

    one commitment of mis character for a future year: to deliver the Tyrrell

    Williams Lecture in Law in 1995 at Washington University School of Law

"  in Si Louis, Missouri.

4. List sour-res and amounts of all income received during the calendar year
        preceding your nomination and for the current calendar year, including any
        salaries, fees, dividends, interest, gifts, rents, royalties, patents, honoraria, and
        other items exceeding $500 or more. (If you prefer, copies of the financial
        disclosure report required by the Ernies in Government Act of 1978 may be
        substituted here.)

                 Copies of the financial disclosure report required by the Ethics in
                 Government Act of 1978, filed by me (1) on May 1, 1993 for the calendar
                 year 1992, and (2) on June 21, 1993, covering the period January 1, 1993
                 through June 1, 1993, are attached as, respectively, Appendix II-1 and
                 Appendix D-2.

                 The completed statement is attached.

6. Have you ever held a position or played a role in a political campaign? If so,
        please identify the particulars of the campaign, including the candidate, dates of
        the campaign, your title and responsibilities.

        Please supply one copy of any memoranda analyzing issues of law or public policy
        that you wrote on behalf of or in connection with a presidential transition team.

                 I have never held a position or played a role in a political campaign. I have
                 never assisted in or prepared any memoranda for or in connection with a
                 presidential transition team.

An ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the American Bar Association's Code
of Professional Responsibility calls for "every lawyer, regardless of professional
praminence or professional workload, to find some time to participate in serving
the disadvantaged." Describe what you have done to fulfill these responsibilities,
listing specific instances and the amount of time devoted to each.

         Service to the ideal, "equal justice under the law," has been a central
         concern of my teaching, writing, speeches, advocacy (prior to my
         appointment to the bench), and daily life. My efforts in this regard include
        many of the publications listed above (I. 12), lectures, participation in panel
         discussions, and litigation.

        Institutional activities in my seventeen years (1963-80) as a law faculty
        member demonstrating a commitment to equal justice include leadership of
        a Dean-appointed commission at Rutgers (Newark) Law School to increase
        participation by minorities in all phases of law school life, service on
        Columbia University's faculty affirmative action review committee, the
        Academic Advisory Board of Columbia University's Center for the Study of
        Human Rights, and the Advisory Board of the Columbia Center for the
        Social Sciences Program in Sex Roles and Social Change.

        As a General Counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union (1973-80), a
        member of the ACLU National Board (1974-80), and a founder of the
        ACLU Women's Rights Project (1972), I was involved in a range of human
        rights and public interest activities, and worked in cooperation with a
        variety of public interest and legal services groups, hi addition, I
        endeavored to advance equal justice and opportunity goals through service
        in the American Bar Association, the Association of the Bar of the City of
        New York, and other professional associations.

        Prior to my June 1980 appointment to the bench, my activities directed to
        making legal services fully available included work as an ACLU volunteer
        attorney, service on the Executive Committee of the Association of the Bar
        of the City of New York during the period the Association established a
        public interest law office, and assistance in the organization of Columbia
        Law School's first legal services clinic.

        In addition to activities noted above as a law faculty member and ACLU
        General Counsel and volunteer attorney, I supported, as a member of the
        Council of the American Bar Association's Section of Individual Rights and
        105

   Responsibilities, ABA resolutions designed to promote wider opportunities
   for economically and socially disadvantaged people and the physically or
   mentally handicapped.

2. The American Bar Association's commentary to its Code of Judicial Conduct
        states that it is inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any organization
        mat invidiously discriminates on the basis of race, sex, or religion. Please list all
        business clubs, social clubs orfraternalorganizations to which you belong or have
        belonged since graduating from law school, and for each such club or
        organization, please state:

   a. the dates during which you were a member and the approximate number of
           members the club or organization had during that period;

   b. the purpose of the club or organization (e.g., social, business, fraternal or
           mixed), the frequency w i i which you used the facilities, and whether you
           used the club or organization for business entertainment;

   c. whether, while you were a member of such club or organization, it did or
           did not include members of all races, religions and both sexes:

   d. if the club or organization did not do so,

   (1) state whether this was the result of a policy or practice of the club or
           organization;

*  (2) if so, describe in full the reasons for mis policy or practice and any

   action you took to change that policy or practice;

   (3) if you were a member of such club or organisation while serving as a
           U.S. Circuit Judge, please give your opinion as to whether the club
           or organization practiced invidious discrimination within the
           meaning of the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, and give the reasons
           for your opinion.

   The following are my responses to mis question 2:

   (a) Woodmont Country Club
           Rockville, Maryland
           June 1980  April 1983
           approximate number of members: 1,500
                                 106

                                m-3

         Army Navy Country Club
         Arlington, Virginia
         April 1983 -
         approximate number of members: 7,000

(b) Both are social clubs with sports (golf, tennis, swimming) and dining
         facilities. My spouse, once an avid golfer, has used these clubs weekly in
         good weather. I have joined him only occasionally, not at all in the current
        year, and have not used the clubs for business entertainment.

(c) Army Navy Country Club includes members of all races, religions, and
        both sexes.

        Woodmont Country Club ("Woodmont"), while I was a member, had a
        predominantly Jewish membership. Its stated policy was nondiscriminatory
        admissions and in fact the membership included women as well as men and
        one member who was black (a friend and colleague whom I sponsored for
        membership in 1982).

(d) In April 1983, however, Woodmont announced a change in its by-laws that
        had the practical effect of strongly discouraging my friend from continuing
        his membership beyond 1984, and he as a result promptly resigned. I
        cannot with certainty say that prompting that resignation was the purpose of
        the by-law change, but the circumstances were, to me, suggestive of mat
        conclusion.

        Immediately upon receiving notification of the by-law change I attempted to
        initiate a reversal of that action. My spouse, who was our family's active
        user of the club facilities, met the following day with members of
        Woodmont's Board of Governors. The Board, however, was unwilling to
        reverse the by-law change and, although the president of Woodmont did
        confer with my friend in an effort to retain him as a member, mat effort did
        not succeed.

        No longer comfortable at Woodmont, I promptly resigned my membership,
        and joined Army Navy Country Club.

        Since the start of the 1970's, it has been my consistent policy to refuse to
        attend professional or social functions at clubs mat do not have
        nondiscriminatory admission policies. I several times refrained from
                                    107

                                       m-4

                 attending American Bar Association functions at such clubs in days before
                 the ABA adopted its current position.

3. Please describe your experience in the entire judicial selection process, from
        beginning to end (including the circumstances which led to your nomination and
        interviews in which you participated). List all interviews or communications you
        had with the White House staff or the Justice Department regarding this
        nomination, the dates of such interviews or communications, and all persons
        present or participating in such interviews or communications.

                 Until Friday, June 11, 1993,1 received no communication from the White
                 House staff or any other government office or officer regarding my
                 nomination. On the morning of June 11, while I was attending the D.C.
                 Circuit Judicial Conference at the Tides Inn, Irvington, Virginia, I received
                 a telephone message from the White House Counsel's Office asking me to
                 return the call. I did so, and was asked where I would be in the course of
                 the weekend. I responded that my husband and I had plans to attend a
                 Saturday, June 12 wedding in Shaftsbury, Vermont, and to return home to
                 Washington, D.C. on Sunday, June 13. I gave White House Counsel's
                 Office the telephone number of the Manchester, Vermont hotel at which I
                 could be called.

                The evening of June 11, my husband and I traveled to Vermont and stayed
                 overnight in Manchester. On Saturday morning, June 12, around 9:30, I
                received a call from White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum asking if I
                 could return to Washington, D.C. later that day or early the next morning to
                meet with his staff. Mr. Nussbaum followed up with a call around 1:00
                p.m. requesting that I take the first available flight back the next morning.

                My husband -and I returned home on Sunday, June 13, around 8:30 a.m.
                About an hour later, Mr. Nussbaum and several members of the White
                House staff, including Ricki Seidman, Ron Khun, and Vincent Foster,
                together with consultants James Hamilton and Ronald Lewis, arrived at my
                apartment to interview me and to review our income tax and social security
                retums-and my financial records ^reports. Shortly after 11:00 a.m., Mr.
                Nussbaum escorted me to the White House to meet the President. Close to
                 11:30 a.m., I met the President. We had a conversation, with no other
                person present, that continued until 1:15 p.m. Mr M"ssbaum and I men
                walked back to my apartment, where the interview with his staff and
                consultants continued until close to 5:00 p.m.
    108

    ra-5

    After 11:00 that evening, Mr. Nussbaum called to tell me the President
    would call within the half-hour. The President did, twice, because the
    initial connection was poor. Some time before midnight, the President told
    me of his intention to nominate me, and I accepted.

4. Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee
        (including but not limited to a member of the White House staff, the Justice
        Department, or the Senate or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal
        issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any
        express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or
        question? If so, please explain fully. Please identify each communication you had
        during the 6 months prior to the announcement of your nomination with any
        member of the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate or its staff
        referring or relating to your views on any case, issue or subject that could come
        before the United States Supreme Court, state who was present or participated in
        such communication, and describe briefly what transpired.

    I repeated on June 14, 1993, just after the President announced his
    nomination for the Supreme Court vacancy, that a judge is bound to decide

    each case fairly, in accord with the relevant facts and the applicable law.

    The day a judge is tempted to be guided, instead, by what "the home crowd

    wants" is the day that judge should resign and pursue other work. It is

    inappropriate, in my judgment, to seek from any nominee for judicial office
    assurance on how that individual would rule in a future case. That

    judgment was shared by those involved in the process of selecting me. No

    such person discussed with me any specific case, legal issue or question in

*  a manner mat could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or

    implied assurances concerning my position on such case, issue, or question.

    During the six months prior to the announcement of my nomination, I had
    no communication with any member of the White House staff, the Justice
    Department or the Senate or its staff referring or relating to my views on
    any case, issue or subject that could come before the United States Supreme
    Court

5. Please discuss your views on the role of the judiciary in our governmental system
        and the following criticism involving "judicial activism."

    The role of the Federal judiciary within the Federal government, and within
    society generally, has become the subject of increasing controversy in
    recent years. It has become the target of both popular and academic
                          109

                       m-6

criticism that alleges that the judicial branch has usurped many of the
prerogatives of other branches and levels of government.

Some of the characteristics of mis "judicial activism" Y--e been said to
include:

a. A tendency by the judiciary toward problem-solution rather than
         grievance-resolution;

b. A tendency by the judiciary to employ the individual plaintiff as a
         vehicle for the imposition of far-reaching orders extending to broad
         classes of individuals;

c. A tendency by the judiciary to impose broad, affirmative duties upon
         governments and society;

d. A tendency by the judiciary toward loosening jurisdicn'onal
         requirements such as standing and ripeness; and

e. A tendency by the judiciary to impose itself upon other institutions
         in the manner of an administrator with continuing oversight
         responsibilities.

Throughout its history, the Federal Judiciary has been attacked repeatedly
for exceeding the bounds of its authority. Criticism of the courts, and
similarly criticism of other branches of government, should not be resented.
Rather, it should be accepted with good grace and considered thoughtfully.
For judges who are lifetime appointees, reasoned criticism has a special
importance. It helps maintain on the bench healthy "tirades of humility
and self-doubt.

While the Federal Judiciary should be exposed fully to diverse views on its
performance, judges must avoid capitulating to result-oriented criticism.
Courts must root decisions in laws enacted by elected representatives,
constitutional provisions ratified by representatives of the people,
precedent, tradition, and reason. It is a reality that individuals and groups,
reflecting virtually every position on the political spectrum, have sometimes
attacked the Federal Judiciary, not because judges arrogaied authority, but
because particular decisions came out, in the critics' judgment, the wrong
way. Chief Justice Marshall set the pattern for the appropriate response to
criticism of mat genre. Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet>536 (1832),
is among the most celebrated examples. See Gunther, Some Reflections on
                         110

                          m-7

 the Judicial Role: Distinctions, Roots, and Prospects, 1979 Wash. U. L.
 Q. 817, 824. Most federal judges, I believe, have maintained that
 courageous stance. A judge steps outside the proper judicial role most
 ccujpicuously and dangerously when he or she flinches from a decision mat
 is legally right because, as Justice Rehnquist put it, the decision is not the
 one "the home crowd wants." Rehnquist, Dedicatory Address: Act Well
 Your Part: Therein All Honor Lies, 7 Pepperdine L. Rev. 227, 229-30
 (1980).

The Federal Judiciary, in recent decades, has indeed become involved in
far-reaching orders extending to large classes of individuals and resolution
of problems far broader than those presented by the traditional bipolar
dispute between individual persons or entities. Most commentators agree
on the initial impetus for such unconventional adjudication on a grand
scale. It was the formidable task faced by the lower federal courts in
attempting to implement faithfully the Supreme Court's school
desegregation mandates. For most federal judges, I believe, the
supervisory, administrative, and oversight chores entailed in the school
cases, and institutional (prison, mental hospital) litigation that came later,
are uncongenial and unwelcome. Had state and federal legislatures and
administrators assumed the implementation burden, the managerial jobs the
courts took on, generally with reluctance and misgivings, could have been
avoided, or at least substantially curtailed.

Most urgently needed, I think, is clear recognition by all branches of
government that in a representative democracy important policy questions
should be confronted, debated, and resolved by elected officials.
Legislating clear standards, principles, and guidelines, for example, in areas
where science and technology are advancing rapidly, is an enormously
challenging undertaking. But the highly general law in a frontier area
commits to administrators or courts responsibility for filling large gaps.
Such a law may call upon judges to perform unaccustomed assignments and
render them vulnerable all the more to criticism for excessive or abusive
exercise of power.

In sum, I believe mat legislators can and should react positively to criticism
of overreaching on the part of the Federal Judiciary by making the hard,
sometimes controversial decisions necessary to equip jMees with clearer
policy directions and standards. The Federal Judiciary, while it must not
decline to determine cases properly before it, complex and controversial as
they may be, must also retain clear vision of its place in the constitutional
                            Ill

                       m-8

scheme and appropriate skepticism concerning the remedial competence of
jurists.

With particular reference to class action litigation, a judge is not free to
ignore the mandate of Congress authorizing litigation in that form, or to
distort the applicable Federal Rules. The core article m requirement, of
course, must be met A case must present a genuine, substantial
controversy between contending parties actively pressing antagonistic
demands. No federal judge is at liberty to issue an advisory opinion at the
request of a petitioner who has suffered no injury, and the sensible
guidelines Justice Brandeis supplied in Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288,
356-48 (1936) (concurring opinion), remain vital in constitutional
adjudication.

As to "judicial activism," the term seems to me much misperceived, a label
too often pressed into service by critics of court results rather man the
legitimacy of court decisions. Beyond question, a judge has no authority to
upset decisions of legislators or executive officials based upon the jurist's
own ideas about enlightened policy or a personal moral view on what
content an ambiguously phrased legal text should have. At the same time,
the Constitution does impose upon judges a duty to assure mat government,
when it impinges upon the property or liberty interests of individuals, does
so by processes that are fair, hi addition, the Constitution places basic
individual rights beyond government authority to eradicate even by
democratically elected representatives employing processes open and fair.
Courts have an important role to play in adjudicating those rights. They
must do so with a clear eye on the text, history, and structure of the
Constitution. Even men, however, all questions of interpretation will not
*iave ready answers. Doubt of one's own wisdom and  willingness to
articulate fully the reasoning process behind a judgment (Justice Harlan,
who served from 19SS until 1971, was a model in that regard) should attend
judicial decision making in areas of uncertainty.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge Ginsburg.
  Now what we will do, as I previously announced, is recess and
reconvene at 3:15.
  [Whereupon, at 12:42 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 3:15 p.m. this same day.]

                                    AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back, Judge. I see your grandson has
joined the photographers' corps. I could see him there. I tell you
what. Your family covers it all.

  As I indicated this morning, before I begin the first round I have
a very brief few comments to make about procedure, not merely in
terms of timing, but how procedurally this Supreme Court nomina-
tion will be handled differently than any that has been handled
thus far, at least any of the others that I have handled. It is some-
what of an outgrowth of some of the contentious fights that we
have had, and hopefully it will make the process a little better.

  First, as I have indicated, although we will be limited in our
rounds of questioning to a certain amount of time, no Senator who
has a question will be denied the opportunity to ask that question
no matter how many rounds it may take them to do that.

  That is always a dangerous thing, Judge, to say with Senator
Specter here because he always has a 7th, 8th, or 20th round, but
they are always good questions. But we will not cut anyone off.

  Judge, you referred in your statement to the nature of questions
that you will answer. On this question, constitutional scholars and
Senate precedents agree. A Senator has not only the right, but the
duty to weigh carefully a nominee's judicial philosophy and, even
more importantly, the consequences of that philosophy for the
country. And as I have stated in past confirmation hearings, my
questions about a nominee's judicial philosophy are not aimed at
getting answers about specific cases.

  You have said you would object, as in my view you should, to
being asked to prejudge a case likely to come before the Supreme
Court. Even if you did answer the question, it wouldn't, for me at
least, tell me much about your judicial philosophy.

  I have said many times and I want you to know that I believe
my duty obliges me to learn how nominees will decide, not what
they will decide, but how they will decide. This obligation for Sen-
ators to inquire into and understand the judicial philosophies of a
Supreme Court nominee is neither new nor disputed any longer, al-
though it was disputed recently.

  Chief Justice William Rehnquist recognized this as long ago as
1959, when he called in the Harvard Law Record for restoring
what he referred to as the Senate's practice of "thoroughly inform-
ing itself on the judicial philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee
before voting to confirm him." Were he saying it today, he would
say "her."

  Judge Ginsburg, the other side of the coin is you must decide, of
course, how to reply to our questions. There is nothing in the Con-
stitution requiring you to reply. You can either give a full answer,
a partial answer, no answer, or you can get up and you can walk
out of here because, to remind everyone, this is only a part of the
process. Our function here is--there is nothing in the Constitution
                                      115
that talks about the Judiciary Committee. It talks about the Sen-
ate. The way in which the Senate has organized itself, it looks to
the committee to give it information regarding the views of a nomi-
nee, but there is nothing in the Constitution that obliges you to an-
swer any question in any particular way or, indeed, answer at all.

  We must arrive at our judgment about your confirmation,
though. As a matter of fact, without mentioning the Justice, there
was one Justice named, a former Senator and a former judge. The
committee asked him to come before the committee, and he said,
"No. My record stands as a judge and a Senator. I am not going
to take the time." He refused to show up, and they still confirmed
him. I wouldn't recommend that, but to make the point for every-
one to understand, there is no constitutional obligation for you to
respond.

  Now, I would hope, as I said to you very briefly, that the way
in which you outlined the circumstances under which you would
reply and not reply, that you will not make a blanket refusal to
comment on things because obviously everything we could ask you
is bound to come before the Court. There is not a controversial
issue in this country that does not have a prospect of coming before
the Court someday. And as we have said, because I think it was
initiated by Senator DeConcini, I voted for a man who I have great
respect for, but it is the vote that I most regret of all 15,000 votes
I have cast as a Senator. I voted to confirm Judge Scalia. He is a
fine, honorable, decent man with whom I agree on nothing. And I
regret that vote.

  One of the reasons I voted for him is that, while he was a bril-
liant scholar with standing and background, he basically refused to
answer questions on anything at all. And I voted for him, and from
that moment on, along with Senator DeConcini, I resolved that if
a nominee, although it is their right, does not answer questions
that don't go to what they would decide, but how they would de-
cide, I will vote against that nominee regardless of who it is. And
you can thank Justice Scalia for that.

  With that object in mind, I would like to very briefly describe in
another 3 minutes here the process by which these hearings will
be conducted. All Senators on the committee, as I said, will have
as much time to ask questions as they feel they should; and you,
Judge, will have as much time as you need to speak to anything,
whether or not you are asked a question.

  I would hope--at this point it seems possible--that we could con-
clude these hearings by week's end. If we do not conclude by Fri-
day, it is my intention at this moment--but I will confer with the
ranking member--to continue on Saturday with the hearings.

  Following the conclusion of the last confirmation hearing for the
last Justice, I felt obliged to reexamine and attempt to reform the
investigative procedures which are an important part of this con-
firmation process. I believe the committee had to better handle al-
legations of a personal nature which are inevitably brought against
Supreme Court nominees, and they are brought against all nomi-
nees. There are none that I am aware of with regard to you, but
there are specious allegations and there are substantive allegations
on occasion. It is hard at the outset to determine one from the
other until we begin the investigative process.
                                      116

  So I have instituted a new procedure. I announced last summer
and again last week that this committee will hold a closed hearing
for every Supreme Court nominee, while I am the chairman at
least. Beginning with you, there will be a closed hearing at one
point. It will be, in this case, on Friday. This is a new procedure
adopted for the first time in this hearing, and it does not imply the
need to discuss any adverse information with regard to you, Judge,
but it is now going to be a standard part of all hearings.

  Whether or not any allegation is raised, we will at some point
for every nominee from this point on go into a closed session, where
only the Senators on the committee and the nominee are there, to
discuss any investigative matter that has been raised. Under rule
XXVI of the Senate, any information that can be potentially embar-
rassing allows us to go into closed session, and embarrassing infor-
mation can be real or false, nonetheless embarrassing under these
klieg lights.

  Under that rule XXVI, which permits the committee to go into
closed session to protect the privacy of a nominee in considering
confidential information, there is also an important caveat; that is,
that every Senator, under the rules, at such a hearing, a closed ses-
sion, is obliged under Senate rules, with the potential sanction of
expulsion from the Senate, to keep confidential any matter that is
raised in that setting.

  The press has asked me since I announced this rule, "What about
the public's right to know?" The committee will decide at that point
whether or not there is any grounding to any allegation that has
been raised. If there is grounding, then we will end up going pub-
lic, and the public will have a right to know and make a determina-
tion.

  One other procedural rule that has changed is that all investiga-
tive matters will be open to every single, solitary U.S. Senator--
only Senators, not their staffs--beyond this committee. And anyone
who comes forward with an allegation--and I announced this last
year--should know at the outset that every Senator in the U.S.
Senate, all 100, will be made aware under Senate rules, which re-
quire confidential information to be protected, of that allegation, so
we do not go through a process whereby Senators, rightly or
wrongly, think they were not fully informed prior to the vote being
taken and so that we do not go through the process where the only
way they can be aware of such information is to make it public.

  So at some point when this hearing closes down, the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee room will be closed off, just like the room of the
Intelligence Committee is. Investigative staff, nine of them, major-
ity and minority, will be in that room for a day, period. Any Sen-
ator in the U.S. Senate can go into that room, get fully briefed by
that staff, read any documents we have, so that they are fully in-
formed.

  Again, I want to emphasize, Judge, this procedure has nothing
to do with you. You are not only an honorable person, but every-
thing I have heard about you, every matter that our committee has
investigated, everything, is perfectly squeaky clean. And so I am
not suggesting--but we are going to institute it, and it is nice to
start with you. It is nice to start with someone where we are not
going to have to spend a lot of time. But honorable people have had
                                      117

the most outrageous charges raised against them, a case in point
being the Attorney General of the United States. When she was
nominated, some of the most outrageous charges were drawn to the
attention of me personally and the investigative staff. We inves-
tigated them, found them without any foundation. It would have
been extremely embarrassing and degrading and, I think, damag-
ing had that taken place under the full glare of the Senate lights.
This new procedure is meant to avoid that, to separate the chaff
from the wheat, and I just want to make that clear as we begin.

  Now, let's get down to business. I ask the staff to kick off the
clock. We are going to have 30-minute rounds, and Judge, at any
time at all, I would ask someone from the White House who may
be with you to indicate to me when it is appropriate to take a
break, because we will forget. We get to get up and walk out of
here after we have our questions and go back and get coffee or take
a call or whatever, and you have to sit there the whole time. So
if I trespass at all on your physical constitution, I want to be made
aware of that. But I will say now we will try to go for a total of
up to 2 hours from this point on, try to get four Senators in. We
will break very briefly to give you a rest. Then we will come back
and continue again until roughly the 6:30 hour.

  Is that agreeable with you, Judge?
  Judge GINSBURG. That is fine, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. It must be an unusual role, for so many years,
you sitting up here and having litigants down there. This is one of
the few we get to do this and one of the few of my duties in the
Senate that I don't particularly enjoy, although in your case it has
been a pleasure thus far. Let me begin now with the questioning.
  I would like to begin by asking you about how you will go about
interpreting our Constitution, Judge. Judges, as you know better
than I do, approach this job in many different ways, and these dif-
ferent approaches often lead to very different results.
  You have made a great many statements about constitutional in-
terpretation as a scholar and as a judge in lectures that you have
delivered--most recently in a talk you gave this year which is re-
ferred to as the Madison Lecture. In that lecture, you said--and I
am quoting here--that "Our fundamental instrument of Govern-
ment is an evolving document."
  You also said you rejected the notion "that the great clauses of
the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the
Framers would have placed on them."
  I could not agree more. If the meaning of the Constitution did
not evolve over time, today we would not have many of the individ-
ual rights all Americans now hold most dear, like the right to
choose whomever we wish to marry. There is nothing in the Con-
stitution, as you know, that gives someone a constitutional right to
marry whom they want. It is not specifically enumerated. And were
that not changed in Loving v. Virginia, there would still be laws
on the books saying blacks can't marry whites and whites can't
marry blacks. Or the right to get a job, whoever you are, whether
you are white or black, male or female.
  But, still, there are hard questions about precisely how the Con-
stitution evolves, about when the Court should recognize a right
not specifically mentioned in the Constitution or specifically con-
                                      118

templated by the authors of that document at that moment, wheth-
er it is an amendment or the core of the Constitution.

  You spoke of these questions at some length in the Madison Lec-
ture. You said that the history of the U.S. Constitution is in large
part a story of--and I quote--"the extension of the constitutional
rights and protections" to include "once excluded groups."

  Judge, can you discuss with me for a moment what allows courts
to recognize rights like the right to marry whomever you wish, like
the right to be employed or not employed without regard to gender,
like the right that was mentioned here earlier by several of my col-
leagues in the opening statements for women to be included in--
I thought the phrase that Eleanor Holmes Norton used was "within
the embrace of the 14th amendment," or something to that effect,
when, in fact, they were not contemplated to be part of that
amendment when it was written.

  What is it that allows the Court to recognize such rights that the
drafters of the Constitution or specific amendments did not men-
tion or even contemplate at the time the amendment, in the case
of the 14th amendment, or the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
were drafted?

  Judge GlNSBURG. That is a large question, Mr. Chairman, and I
will do my best to respond.

  First, I think the credit goes to the Founders. When I visited
Senator Thurmond, he was kind enough to give me a pocket Con-
stitution.

  The CHAIRMAN. I think that was Sam Ervin's. Did you give her
Senator Ervin's pocket Constitution?

  Senator THURMOND. I gave her a Thurmond Constitution. That
is the U.S. Constitution.

  Judge GlNSBURG. But this pocket Constitution contains another
document, and it is our basic rights-declaring document. It is the
Declaration of Independence, the Declaration that created the Unit-
ed States.

  I think the Framers are shortchanged if we view them as having
a limited view of rights, because they wrote, Thomas Jefferson
wrote, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these"--among these--"are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness," and that government is formed
to protect and secure those rights.

  Now, when the Constitution was written, as you know, there was
much concern over a Bill of Rights. There were some who thought
a Bill of Rights dangerous because one couldn't enumerate all the
rights of the people; one couldn't compose a complete catalog. The
thing to do was to limit the powers of government, and that would
keep government from trampling on people's rights.

  But there was a sufficient call for a Bill of Rights, and so the
Framers put down what was in the front of their minds in the Bill
of Rights. Let's look at the way rights are stated in the Bill of
Rights in contrast to the Declaration of Independence, let's take lib-
erty as it appears in the fifth amendment.

  The statement in the fifth amendment--"nor shall any person be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"--
is written as a restriction on the government. The Founders had
                                      119
already declared in the Declaration that liberty is an unalienable
right, and the government is accordingly warned to keep off, both
in the structure of the Constitution, which limits the powers of gov-
ernment, and in the Bill of Rights. And, as you also know, Mr.
Chairman, the Framers were fearful that this limited catalog might
be perceived--even though written as a restriction on government
rather than as a grant of rights to people--as skimpy, as not stat-
ing everything that is. And so we have the ninth amendment,
which states that the Constitution shall not be construed to deny
or disparage other rights.

  You might contrast our Bill of Rights with the great 1789 French
Declaration of the Rights of Man, which does appear to grant or
confer rights, for example, the state grants citizens a right to speak
freely. But our Bill of Rights doesn't say the state gives one a right
to speak. It says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom
of speech. So the whole thrust of it is that people have rights, and
government must be kept from trampling on them. And the rights
are stated with great breadth in the Declaration of Independence.

  Now, it is true--and it is a point I made in the Madison Lec-
ture--that the immediate implementation in the days of the
Founding Fathers in many respects was limited. "We the People"
was not then what it is today. The most eloquent speaker on that
subject was Justice Thurgood Marshall, during the series of bicen-
tennial celebrations, when songs in full praise of the Constitution
were sung. Justice Marshall reminded us that the Constitution's
immediate implementation, even its text, had certain limitations,
blind spots, blots on our record. But he said that the beauty of this
Constitution is that, through a combination of judicial interpreta-
tion, constitutional amendment, laws passed by Congress, "We the
People" has grown ever larger. So now it includes people who were
once held in bondage. It includes women who were left out of the
political community at the start.

  I hope that begins to answer your question. The view of the
Framers, their large view, I think was expansive. Their immediate
view was tied to the circumstances in which they lived.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, it does answer the question, and I am de-
lighted, to be very blunt about it, with the answer. As I have indi-
cated to you and said on numerous occasions over my 20 years in
the Senate, I do not expect a nominee nor demand of a nominee
to agree with me on substantive issues. But it does make a dif-
ference to me and give me, at least, some insight into the view of
the past history and the future of this Nation that a nominee has,
the vision they have, if I know the place from which they believe
our rights are derived. And you have made a fundamental distinc-
tion from other nominees that have been before this committee in
the past decade, in that you acknowledge there is a ninth amend-
ment. You have no idea what a milestone that is in this committee.
And I am being a bit facetious, but we had one nominee who said
the ninth amendment was "nothing but an ink blot on the Con-
stitution."

  But your emphasis that whereby we derive rights, the courts
over the years have derived rights, or expanded a concept which at
the time the Constitution was written, it did not embrace a specific
circumstance, you have indicated, as I understand your answer,

         75-974 0 - 9 4 -- 5
                                      120
that you start off with the position, which I happen to share, that
this is a limited Government. We do not derive our rights as
human beings from a piece of paper called the Constitution. The
Government derives its rights from "We the People." "We the Peo-
ple" got together back a couple hundred years ago and said this is
the deal we are going to make among ourselves and this is the
power we are going to allow Government to have.

  I think the important word in the ninth amendment is "deny or
disparage others"--referring to rights--"retained by the people."
And as you point out, the distinction between how the great French
Declaration of Rights or other great instruments proclaiming
human rights and dignity, have always proclaimed them in terms
of granting them to the people. In this case, the way in which, as
you point out, our Constitution is written, the first amendment,
"The Congress shall make no law"--a very different perspective
from which we in the country have started. Second, you are ref-
erencing the 15th amendment, the Declaration of Independence,
and the 9th amendment, and I expect possibly the 14th amend-
ment as well, as a basis from which the courts have found over the
last 200 years, and in particular over the last 50 years, an intellec-
tually consistent and rational basis for being consistent with the
Constitution, but nonetheless expanding individual rights in the
sense that they recognize their existence and their guarantee of
constitutional protection.

  So it does answer the question for me, but I would like to move
from there, if I may now, having established that, to where the
Constitution has to be read by Justices in light of its broadest and
most fundamental commitments, commitments to liberty, commit-
ments to individual dignity, equality of opportunity. In my view,
the Framers were wise when they drafted the Constitution with
such broad language. I think--and there is ample historical evi-
dence to indicate--that they understood that at the time that the
document they were drafting for this newborn Nation was one that
required concepts which embodied more than specific guarantees
that could change with time. And I believe they did it in broad con-
cepts, and not specifics, precisely to avoid freezing the rights and
protections that were afforded Americans.

  Now, their method permits the meaning of the document to
progress as we progress, and as the world changes and as we better
understand the full scope of our Nation's principles and ideals, our
interpretation of the Constitution has changed.

  Now, in the Madison Lecture, though, you also noted constraints
on the ability of the courts to expand individual rights. You recog-
nized that that has been done, that there has constantly been an
expansion, but that there was, in a sense, a self-imposed restraint.
And you wrote that movement in this direction of expansion by the
courts should be measured--this is your quote, "measured and re-
strained."

  You also wrote that courts generally should follow rather than
lead changes taking place elsewhere in society. And you criticized
the Court, as I read the lecture, for too often "stepping boldly in
front of the political process." I believe that was the quote.

  But, Judge, in your work as an advocate in the 1970's, you spoke
with a different voice. In the 1970's, you pressed for immediate ex-
                                      121
tension of the fullest constitutional protection for women under the
14th amendment, and you said the Court should grant such protec-
tion notwithstanding what the rest of society, including the legisla-
tive branch, thought about the matter.

  For example, in one brief you wrote that "The quality of the
Court's review is not determined by the presence or absence of
stirrings in the legislative branch." I believe that was in the
Frontiero brief.

  Now, how does that square with your statement in the Madison
Lecture that courts generally should follow rather than lead soci-
ety, and that courts should move in measured motions, in meas-
ured steps? Is my question clear?

  Judge GlNSBURG. You are referring to the Frontiero (1973) brief?
  The CHAIRMAN. Where you said, if I am not mistaken, 'The qual-
ity of the Court's review is not determined by the presence or ab-
sence of stirrings." Then in the Madison Lecture you said that the
Court should be measured and restrained: It should follow rather
than lead changes taking place elsewhere in society. Can you
square those for me or point out their consistency to me?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is a good answer. Now we will go on to the
next question. [Laughter.]
  Judge GlNSBURG. The Frontiero (1973) brief from which you read
was, in fact, the third in a set of briefs urging the Supreme Court
to recognize the equal stature of men and women before the law.
As an advocate in those cases, I gave the Court initially two and
later three choices for the rationale. One was that any classifica-
tion based on gender should have the closest review.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS would distinctions made on race?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. And then, at the opposite pole, I said,
these sex-based classifications that riddle our statute books
couldn't even pass the lowest level of review, the rational basis
test. The first case in which those arguments were presented was
a very simple one. It was the case of Sally Reed, whose young
son--a teen-aged boy--died under tragic circumstances. Sally Reed
applied to be administrator of her son's estate. The boy's father--
the parents were separated at that point--also applied to be ad-
ministrator.
  The State of Idaho at that time had a rule--a statute--for decid-
ing such cases. The rule was: As between persons equally entitled
to administer a decedent's estate, males must be preferred to fe-
males. It may be astonishing to some of the young people sitting
behind you that laws like that were on the books in the States of
the United States in the early 1970's, but they were. And there
were many of them.
  There had never been in the history of the United States any in-
stance in which any law that differentiated on the basis of sex had
been declared unconstitutional up to Reed v. Reed (1971).
  The CHAIRMAN. AS a matter of fact, some had been challenged
and declared to be constitutional.
  Judge GINSBURG. A number of them. But without reciting that
entire history, as an advocate I presented to the Court different
ways that the Justices could reach the decision in Sally Reed's
case, which was as clear on its facts as any case could be.
                                      122
  That was the position I took as an advocate. My expectation, to
be candid, was that I would repeat that kind of argument maybe
half a dozen times.
  The CHAIRMAN. Until they got it right?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Until the Court would look at one classification
after the other and say, yes, this is irrational. And then the Jus-
tices would come to the point where they would say none of these
lines make any sense, so we might as well announce that drawing
lines on the basis of gender is in almost all cases impermissible,
and the presumption will be against, rather than for, their con-
stitutionality.
  I saw my role in those days as an advocate in part and as a
teacher in part, because one of the differences about gender dis-
crimination and race discrimination is that race discrimination was
immediately perceived as evil, as odious, as wrong, as intolerable.
But the response I was getting from the judges before whom I ap-
peared when I first talked about sex-based discrimination, then I
began to use the word "gender"--I will explain that perhaps later--
was: "What are you talking about? Women are treated ever so
much better than men."
  I was talking to an audience of men who thought immediately
that what I was saying was somehow critical about the way they
treated their wives, the way they treated their daughters. Their no-
tion was, far.from treating women in an odious, evil, discriminatory
way, women were kept on a pedestal. Women were spared the
messy, dirty real world; they were kept in clean, bright homes. I
was trying to educate the judges that there was something wrong
with the notion, "Sugar and spice and everything nice, that's what
little girls are made of"--for that very notion was limiting the op-
portunities, the aspirations of our daughters.
  One doesn't learn that lesson in a day. Generally, change in our
society is incremental, I think. Real change, enduring change, hap-
pens one step at a time.
  This litigation may be illustrative. In the second case you men-
tioned, Frontiero (1973), four Justices came on board for "sex as a
suspect classification." I was told that by one of the lawyers at the
ACLU women's rights project the day the decision was announced.
It may even have been the executive director who came in and
said, "You got four votes for sex as a suspect classification." I said,
"It is too soon. We are not going to get the fifth."
  The education process hadn't gone on long enough. Even though
as an advocate I was advancing sex as a suspect classification as
the end point I expected the Court to reach after it dealt with a
series of real-life cases, cases like Sally Reed's case, I didn't expect
it to happen in one fell swoop.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I don't mean to cut you off, but this is an
appropriate place to take the next step. I understand what your
strategy was, and I understand now how you view and perceive
permanent, important change to come about, how it does come
about. And I think it would be hard to argue from a historical per-
spective that you are wrong. I don't mean to do that.
  I am trying to square, though, your--I understand your position
as an advocate. Then you became an appellate court judge, and you
gave a lecture this year called the Madison Lecture. Now, as an ap-
                                      123
pellate court judge, you are required to follow Supreme Court
precedent. You are not able to go off on your own. A subject I am
going to come back to in my second round with you is your view
of stare decisis, because we both know that in the Court you are
about to go to, you are not bound by any previous Supreme Court
ruling. As a judge on the circuit court, you are honor-bound to fol-
low, to the best of your ability, what you believe to be the ruling
consistent with what the Supreme Court has ruled as close as you
can approximate it.

  Now, you have had three different roles: advocate, where you
were educating--and I know you mean that literally, and that is
exactly what has to be done. Believe it or not, some of us in the
legislature think we have to do it that way as well, like the vio-
lence against women legislation, which I would like to talk to you
about here as well from a constitutional perspective, where there
are laws on the books now that are outrageous. They don't relate
directly to equal protection considerations, but they start off with
premises about women that are arcane and wrong.

  In my own State of Delaware, you can be convicted of first-degree
rape if you rape a stranger, but if you rape someone with whom
you have had an acquaintanceship, under the law you cannot be
convicted. It can be as brutal a rape, as terrible a rape, but it is
second-degree rape because you are "a social companion." Implicit
in that is if you are a social companion somehow the woman is par-
tially responsible for this.

  So there are still these outrageous laws on the books in other
areas. But the point is you then moved from being an advocate to
being a judge on the circuit court of appeals. And as a judge, you
indicated what I said, that the Court should move in a measured,
restrained way.

  You also noted, though, that the Court in Brown v. Board of
Education was not timid; it was not fearful; it stepped out in front
of society. And yet in another lecture you said that Brown "ended
race segregation in our society, perhaps a generation before State
legislators in our Southern States would have budged on the issue."
Again, a seeming inconsistency. One, you say the Court should ba-
sically wait and not step out too far ahead of society. The other,
you indicated that, in Brown you acknowledged, they did. They
stepped out maybe an entire generation ahead of society.

  They stopped an odious practice in Brown v. Board of Education,
and so what I would like to know is, as a Supreme Court Justice,
what will guide you, if you, as you may know--I am not asking you
this, but you may conclude that strict scrutiny is the measure that
should be applied under the equal protection clause of the 14th
amendment relative to women, as it is with regard to race.

  If you, as a Justice, concluded that is the proper test to be ap-
plied, notwithstanding the fact society may not have gotten that
far, would it be appropriate? Not will you, but would it be appro-
priate for you, as a Justice, to move ahead of society, like the Jus-
tices in Brown did and moved ahead of society?

  What did you mean in the Madison lectures that the Court
should not? Were you referring to the lower courts, the Supreme
Court, all the courts?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Mr. Chairman, first may I say that the Court
has never rejected application of the suspect classification doctrine
to sex. Most recently, when it came up, the Court said we don't
have to reach that question, it is still open, because even if we em-
ploy a somewhat less exacting test--a heightened standard, but
somewhat less exacting--the classification before us must fall. The
case in which the Court made that statement involved exclusion of
men from a nursing school the University of Mississippi main-
tained. The fine opinion by Justice O'Connor indicates the author's
understanding that opening the doors of a nursing school--I would
say the same thing for nursery school teaching--opening such
doors to men can only improve things for women. When a job re-
mains one that only women fill, it tends to be paid lower. When
men take part, the pay tends to go up.
  But let me try to respond to your question about Brown (1954),
about moving ahead of society and at what level. First, recall that
Brown wasn't born in a day. Thurgood Marshall came to the Court
showing that facilities or opportunities were not equal, in case after
case, in notable 1948 and 1950 higher education cases, particularly:
McLaurin (1950), Sweatt v. Painter (1950), Sipuel (1948), a line
started even earlier, in 1938, in Gaines. He set the building blocks,
until it became obvious that separate couldn't be equal.
  Something else had happened. One of the influences on Brown,
I think, was a war we had just come through, in which people were
exterminated on the basis of what other people called their race.
And I don't think that apartheid in the United States could long
outlive the Holocaust. From that perspective, the Court was not
moving ahead of most of the people. There was resistance, of
course, indeed massive resistance in some parts of the country.
  But Brown itself, even Brown didn't command an end to all ra-
cial segregation. The end came years later. Brown was decided in
1954. It wasn't until Loving v. Virginia in 1967 that the Court took
the final step in the series by declaring a miscegenation law uncon-
stitutional.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO what did you mean when you said, Judge, in
the Madison lecture that it ended race discrimination in our coun-
try, perhaps a generation before State legislators in our southern
States would have budged on the issue? Are you saying that the
Nation itself may have been in sync with Brown and the Court not
that far ahead of the Nation, and it was only that part of the coun-
try?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The massive resistance was concentrated in
some parts of the country. That there was discrimination through-
out the country is undoubtedly true. But there was a positive reac-
tion in Congress, not immediately, but voting rights legislation
started in the late fifties, and then we had the great civil rights
legislation of 1964. The country was moving together.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was a decade later. My time is up, Judge. You
have been very instructive about how things have moved, but you
still haven't--and I will come back to it--squared for me the issue
of whether or not the Court can or should move ahead of society
a decade, even admittedly in the Brown case, it was at least a dec-
ade ahead of society. The Congress did not, in fact, react in any
meaningful way until 10 years later, and so it moved ahead.
                                      125
  One of the things that has been raised, the only question that
I am aware of that has been raised, not about you personally, but
about your judicial philosophy in the popular press and among
those who follow this, is how does this distinguished jurist distin-
guish between what she thinks the Court is entitled to do under
the Constitution and what she thinks it is wise for it to do. What
is permitted is not always wise.
  So I am trying to get--and I will fish for it again when I come
back--I am trying to get a clear distinction of whether or not you
think, like in the case of Brown, where it clearly did step out ahead
of where the Nation's legislators were, whether that was appro-
priate. If it was, what do you mean by "it should not get too far
out ahead of society," when you talked about that in the Madison
lectures?
  But I will give it another try. I think you not only make a great
Justice, you are good enough to be confirmed as Secretary of State,
because State Department people never answer the questions fully
directly, either.
  Judge GlNSBURG. May I leave you, Mr. Chairman
  The CHAIRMAN. If you would like to answer it more fully, I am
anxious to
  Judge GlNSBURG. I might offer two thoughts to consider between
now and our next round. One of them was prompted by Senator
Moseley-Braun, when she reminded us that the spirit of liberty
must lie in the hearts of the women and men of this country. It
would be one solution, wouldn't it, to appoint Platonic guardians
who would rule wisely for all us. But then we wouldn't have a de-
mocracy, would we?
  We cherish living in a democracy, and we know that this Con-
stitution did not create a tricameral system. Judges must be mind-
ful of their place in our constitutional order; they must always re-
member that we live in a democracy that can be destroyed if judges
take it upon themselves to rule as Platonic guardians.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I would have been happier, had the Court
in Dred Scott decided to go ahead of society. I think America would
maybe have had the same Civil War, but would have moved ahead
more rapidly. Clearly, it would have been stepping out by 100 years
ahead of where the Nation ultimately arrived.
  I am not asking you to accept that, but what I am trying to get
at is, there is no doubt that a Court's opinion cannot be sustained
without ultimately the support of the majority of the people. As
someone said relative to the Pope during World War II, how many
legions does he have? You all have no legions. Ultimately, your
judgments, as the Supreme Court, will depend upon the willingness
of the American people to accept them as appropriate. I have no
doubt about that.
  I understand that, but there does come a time in the course of
human events when the Court has in the past, and I suspect may
have to in the future, be a generation ahead of where the Nation
is. And I am wondering whether or not, as a matter of judging, if
you conclude it should arrive at a decision, but look behind you and
determine that the folks ain't with you, that that would restrain
you from saying and enunciating what you believe the Constitution
calls for in terms of enunciating a right or striking down a prohibi-
                                      126
tion that the popular wisdom is not prepared to strike down. That
is the essence of my question.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Mr. Chairman, I can assure you on one thing:
I will never, as long as I am able to sit on any court, rule the way
the home crowd wants out of concern about how it will play in the
press if I rule the other way.

  The CHAIRMAN. I wasn't implying playing the press. I know you
would never do that. That is not even a question. My question is
again--and I will drop it now--my question is whether or not, if
you determined that it is appropriate in 1948, and you were on the
Court, and you deemed separate but equal was inappropriate, or in
1938 that it was not constitutionally permissible under the 14th
amendment, whether notwithstanding the fact you had reached
that conclusion as a legal scholar and as a Justice bound by no pre-
vious Supreme Court ruling, that notwithstanding the fact that in
1938 America had not gone to war, did not understand genocide,
did not have a notion of the value and the role that blacks would
play in that war, that you would have been willing to say, if you
believed it at that moment, we should strike down the law that the
vast majority of Americans thinks is appropriate.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think I can give you a clear example. It was
Chief Justice John Marshall, who ruled in a way that the State of
Georgia found exceedingly displeasing. The case was Worcester v.
Georgia in 1832. Marshall ruled the right way, even though he
knew that the people of that State, especially the people in power
in that state, would be down on his head for that ruling. But it was
the right ruling and so he made it.

  May I also say that Dred Scott (1857) was the wrong decision for
its time. There was no warrant for it at the time it was rendered.
It should never have been decided the way it was. It was incorrect
originally and it was incorrect ever after. I don't think it was a de-
cision that the Court had to make at the time that it made it.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Judge. I have exceeded
my time, and I thank you for your cooperation.

  I yield to the Senator from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. Judge, I thought your answers were pretty good.
Because, as a matter of fact, Dred Scott was the first illustration
of substantive due process, where the judges just decided they want
it done that way. Justice Taney thought he was really saving the
country through doing that, so he did that, which really was not
ahead of society. Society, at least in the North, was ahead of them.
  And in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, Mr. Justice Harlan, in
1896, had previously said that separate but equal was wrong. So,
in all honesty, the Court was not ahead of society, but society real-
ly was ready for that type of a decision.
  Now, there are many that criticize Brown v. Board of Education
for the rationale of the decision, but, frankly, all Brown v. Board
of Education did was what Justice Harlan suggested, and that is
treat equality as equality under the 14th amendment.
  So it isn't a question of whether you are ahead of society or not.
It is a question of whether you are actually interpreting the laws
in accordance with the original meaning which, of course, under
the 14th amendment meant equal protection, equal rights, equal-
ity.
                                      127
  Let me just move on to something else. I would like to ask you
whether you agree with the following statements about the role of
a judge, including a Supreme Court Justice. The first statement is
this: The judge's authority derives entirely from the fact that he or
she is applying the law, not his or her personal values. Do you
agree or disagree with that?
  Judge GlNSBURG. No judge is appointed to apply his or her per-
sonal values, but a judge will apply the values that come from the
Constitution, its history, its structure, the history of our country,
the traditions of our people.
  Senator HATCH. I agree. Then you agree with that basic state-
ment then, you shouldn't be applying your own personal values?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I made a statement quoting Holmes to that ef-
fect in my opening remarks.
  Senator HATCH. YOU did. What about this statement: The only le-
gitimate way for a judge to go about defining the law is by attempt-
ing to discern what those who made the law intended.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think all people could agree with that. But as
I tried to say in response to the chairman's question, trying to di-
vine what the Framers intended, I must look at that matter two
ways. One is what they might have intended immediately for their
day, and the other is their larger expectation that the Constitution
would govern, as Cardozo said, not for the passing hour, but for the
expanding future. And I know no better illustration of that than to
take the words of the great man who wrote the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. Thomas Jefferson said: "Were our state a pure democ-
racy, there would still be excluded from our deliberations women
who, to prevent depravation of morals and ambiguity of issues,
should not mix promiscuously in gatherings of men." Nonetheless,
I do believe that Thomas Jefferson, were he alive today, would say
that women are equal citizens.
  The CHAIRMAN. Or else he wouldn't be President. [Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. But what was his understanding of "all men
are created equal" for his day, for his time? It was that "the breasts
of women were not made for political convulsion." So I see an im-
mediate intent about how an ideal is going to be recognized at a
given time and place, but also a larger aspiration as our society im-
proves. I think the Framers were intending to create a more perfect
union that would become ever more perfect over time.
  Senator HATCH. I think that is a good way of putting it. I think
reasonable jurists can disagree about what the original meaning of
a provision is or how to apply it under certain circumstances. I
don't think there is any question about that, or as to how to apply
it to a given set of facts. But so long as the judge's or Justice's
starting point is the original meaning of the text, then it seems to
me that judge is seeking to fulfill his or her constitutional duty.
  Let me ask about this statement: If a judge abandons the inten-
tion of the lawmakers as his or her guide, there is no law available
to the judge and the judge begins to legislate a social agenda for
the American people. That goes well beyond his or her legitimate
power.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The judge has a law--whether it is a statute
that Congress passed or our highest law, the Constitution--to con-
strue, to interpret, and must try to be faithful to the provision. But
                                      128

it is no secret that some of these provisions are not self-defining.
Some of the laws that you write are not self-defining. There is
nothing a judge would like better than to be able to look at a text
and say this text is clear and certain, I do not have to go beyond
it to comprehend its meaning. But often that is not the case, and
then a judge must do more than just read the specific words. The
judge will read on to see what else is in the law and read back to
see what was there earlier. The judge will look at precedent, to see
how the words in this provision or in similar provisions have been
construed. The effort is always to relate to the intent of the law-
giver or the lawmaker, but sometimes that intent is obscure.

  Senator HATCH. I like your statement that the judge has an obli-
gation to be faithful to the provisions of the law, and you have ex-
plained that I think very well.

  Let me move to another subject that is very important to my
folks out in Utah, and that is the second amendment. I would like
to address the second amendment, the right to keep and bear arms,
a right that many of us from Utah and across the country believe
sometimes gets short shrift.

  For instance, for most of our country's history, the Bill of Rights
limited only the powers of the Federal Government, not the States.
But through the process of so-called selective incorporation, the Su-
preme Court in recent decades ruled that most of the provisions of
the Bill of Rights apply via the 14th amendment against the
States.

  Now, one right, however, that has not yet been held to be pro-
tected from infringement by the States, of course, is the second
amendment right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms. Now, do
you believe that there is a principled basis for applying almost all
of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights against the States, but
not the second amendment?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The second amendment shares with at least
two other provisions of the Bill of Rights that status. They are sig-
nificant provisions, but they have not been held to be incorporated.
One is the grand jury presentment or indictment provision

  Senator HATCH. In amendment V.
  Judge GlNSBURG [continuing]. In article V. grand juries are not
obligatory for the States. And another, also a right that many peo-
ple think is very important, is the seventh amendment; the right
to trial by jury in a civil case, stated in the seventh amendment,
has not been held applicable to the States. So the second amend-
ment doesn't stand alone. Grand juries and civil juries fall in that
same category.
  As you know, Senator, there is much debate about what the sec-
ond amendment means. I think the last time the Supreme Court
addressed the matter was in 1939, was it not, in the Miller case?
So I am not prepared to expound on it beyond making the obvious
point that the second amendment has been variously interpreted.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I think what I am saying is I would agree
with Justice Black, that if we are going to have incorporation
against the States of any portion of the Bill of Rights, all eight
amendments conferring rights should apply against the States. I
don't think judges should be picking and choosing which rights
they prefer.
                                      129
  Now, in the two cases that you have mentioned, the amendments
still apply, other than those features. But it is just one I wanted
to raise with you, just for whatever purpose I could.
  Judge Ginsburg, I am concerned about a reverse discrimination
case decided in the D.C. Circuit that you sought to overturn. Now,
that is the case of Hammon v. Barry. That was in 1987. There the
court ruled the District of Columbia Fire Department's racial hir-
ing quotas violated title VII of the equal protection clause. In that
particular case, according to Judge Starr's opinion, there was no
evidence of any actual intentional discrimination in hiring by the
D.C. Fire Department since the 1950's, in other words, no evidence
of discrimination or intentional discrimination.
  In fact, long before the quota hiring policy began, the majority
of the new hires by the department had been black. In Judge
Mikva's opinion dissenting from the court's denial of rehearing en
bane in the case, an opinion which you joined, Judge Mikva wrote:
"This case concerns one of the fundamental dilemmas our society
faces, how to eliminate a 'manifest imbalance' that reflected under-
representation of women and minorities in the workforce."
  Now, because you joined in this opinion here, I take it that you
agree with Judge Mikva that a "manifest imbalance" in an employ-
er's workforce is sufficient justification under title VII for either
voluntary or court-ordered race and sex-based quotas and pref-
erences under title VII, even if the imbalance is not traceable to
any prior intentional discrimination. Would that be a fair state-
ment?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Hatch, the Hammon (1987) case is not
in the front of my mind. As you have pointed out, I wasn't on the
panel that made the decision in that case.
  Senator HATCH. I won't hold you to it, because I don't expect you
to remember all of these.
  Judge GINSBURG. This was a
  Senator HATCH. YOU have written some 700 opinions, as I recall,
so I am not going to hold you to that.
  Judge GINSBURG. I think it is important, though, to understand
the difference between being part of a full court and being a mem-
ber of a three-judge panel, which I was not. I was not one of the
decisionmakers in the Hammon case, I was simply a member of the
court, and all of us voted whether to hear the case en bane. But
I was not part of any decision in that case.
  Senator HATCH. Well, the problem with permitting a manifest
imbalance, that is, a statistical disparity not traceable to any inten-
tional discrimination, to justify quotas or other preferential euphe-
misms like numerical goals is that statistical disparities can and
do often occur for many reasons other than discrimination, and it
is unfair to penalize innocent persons and deny them opportunities
through quotas or other preferences, simply because an employer's
hiring statistics are not balanced, according to some notion of sta-
tistical proportionality.
  It is an important issue. It is probably one of the most important
issues in the future for our country. And I don't expect you to tell
me how you would rule, but let me just pose a hypothetical situa-
tion to you.
                                      130

  Suppose a small business in a majority city that was majority
black had never hired a black person, even though that business
in over a decade had hired more than 50 people. Further, suppose
that a disappointed black job applicant filed a discrimination suit
and that she or he was unable to provide any direct evidence of in-
tentional discrimination by the employer. Would such statistics
standing alone, in your view, justify an inference of racial discrimi-
nation by the employer? And would that employer, in your view,
to avoid an expensive and protracted lawsuit that could cost hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars, be justified in using quotas or other
forms of racial preferences to eliminate the manifest imbalance, if
that really is the law?

  And just one other question: Would a Federal court be justified
in such a case, in ordering that employer to resort to quotas or
other forms of racial preferences, to eliminate or reduce the mani-
fest imbalance?

  Senator COHEN. Would you repeat the question again for me?
[Laughter.]

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think I have the gist of it, Senator Cohen.
  Senator Hatch, we have many employment discrimination cases
in the court. They come to us with a very large record of facts de-
veloped in the trial court, and they come also with lengthy briefs
on both sides. I study those records intensely, read the arguments,
have my law clerks do additional research, come armed to the teeth
to the oral arguments so I can ask testing questions. So I am al-
ways suspicious, on guard, when given a one, two, three series in
a hypothetical. I know I have done it myself when I was a law
teacher, and sometimes my students would answer to that kind of
question: "Unprepared."
  But I can say this. I was thinking in relation to your question,
about a particular case, one that, in fact, went to the Supreme
Court. It was a Santa Clara (California) Highway Department case
that involved an affirmative action program.
  Senator HATCH. That was the Johnson (1987) case.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right, Paul Johnson was the plaintiff and he
complained that Diane Joyce had gotten a job he should have got-
ten, and it was a result of the affirmative action plan. That was
a case that was much discussed.
  I will tell you a nonlegal reaction I had to it. The case involved
a department that had 238 positions, and not one before Diane
Joyce was ever held by a woman. After an initial screening, 12 peo-
ple qualified for the job. That number was further reduced until
there were 7 considered well qualified for the job. Then the final
selection was made.
  On the point score, Paul Johnson came out slightly higher than
Diane Joyce, but part of the composite score was determined by a
subjective test, an interview, if I recall correctly, and they were
scored on the basis of the interview.
  I thought back to the days when I was in law school. I did fine
on the pen and paper tests. I had good grades. And then I had
interviews. I didn't score as high as the men on the interviews. I
was screened out on the basis of the interviews.
  So I wonder whether the kind of program that was involved in
the Johnson (1987) case was no preference at all, but a safeguard,
                                      131
a check against unconscious bias, bias that may even have been
conscious way back in the fifties. In a department that has 238 po-
sitions and none of them are filled by women, perhaps the slight
plus--one must always recognize that there is another interest at
stake in the cases, Paul Johnson's--checks against the prospect
that the employer was in fact engaged unconsciously in denying
full and equal opportunity to women.

  These are very difficult cases and each one has to be studied in
its own particular context. But in that case, at least, I related back
to my own experience. Whenever a subjective test is involved, there
is that concern. If you are a member of the group that has up until
now been left out, you wonder whether the person conducting the
interview finds you unfamiliar, finds himself slightly uncomfort-
able, thinking about you being part of a workplace that up until
then has been, say, all-white or all-male.

  I did want to make one comment, if you will allow me, Senator
Hatch.

  Senator HATCH. Surely.
  Judge GlNSBURG. When you said that Brown (1954) wasn't ahead
of the people, in at least one respect
  Senator HATCH. It was ahead of some of the people, there is no
question about that.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. When I think about one of my wonderful
District of Columbia circuit colleagues, Judge Skelley Wright, who
was a brave district judge in New Orleans in the 1960's, a judge
who for 10 years tried to implement the Brown decision, when mas-
sive resistance was mounted against it. But he did what a good
judge should do, he enforced the law.
  Senator HATCH. Sure. The reason I brought up Dred Scott and
that case is because there were segments, whole segments of our
society who were way behind--or way ahead in the case of Dred
Scott, almost all of the North was ahead. And many people in the
South, they refused to fight on the part of the South.
  In the case of Brown v. Board of Education, there were many in
both areas that were way ahead and who expected and really de-
manded the decision that came.
  Well, the reason I gave you the hypothetical example I did is be-
cause I have had a lot of experience with small business people
who are suffering the stings of these employment discrimination
cases. The average cost of defending those cases before our 1991
civil rights bill that we enacted here, which I voted for, the average
cost of defending it, defense alone, just paying their attorneys to
defend them is $80,000. That was before that statute, and I suspect
that cost has gone up a little bit since then.
  But I give you that example I did, because I have great faith in
you. I have known you since 1980, and I have watched what you
have done, I have admired you, I have no doubt that you are a per-
son of total equality and a person who deserves to be on the Su-
preme Court.
  But in response to the Judiciary Committee questionnaire, in the
13 years since you went on the bench in 1980, you have not had
a single black law clerk or secretary or intern, out of 57 such em-
ployees that you have hired. Now, I find no fault with that, because
                                      132
I know that there was no desire to discriminate, even though your
court sits in the middle of a majority black city of Washington, DC.

  Now, some, if they took the broad language of Abner Mikva in
that case, might call that a manifest imbalance. Now, I would not
suggest for a moment that that imbalance resulted from any inten-
tional discrimination on your part. The crucial point to keep in
mind, however, is that when the concept of discrimination is di-
vorced from intent and we rely on statistics alone, a small business
man or woman with your record of employing minorities might find
himself or herself spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to
fend off discrimination suits, and that in fact is what is happening
around this country right now.

  Such an employer might adopt quotas or other forms of pref-
erences in order to avoid or avert such litigation under any number
of Federal civil rights laws. And I am worried about it, because it
is not fair to the employer and it is not fair to the persons denied
opportunities, because of preferences.

  Naturally, I am concerned about preferences and I know you are
and I know that you are a very good person. But I just want to
point that out, because that happens every day all over this coun-
try, where there is no evidence of intent and, in fact, was no desire
on the part of the employer to exclude anybody.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I appreciate that, Senator Hatch, but I do want
to say that I have tried to

  Senator HATCH. I know you have.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And I am going to try harder, and if you con-
firm me for this job, my attractiveness to black candidates is going
to improve. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. That is wonderful. I like that. But let me just
say you can see my point. These things are tough cases. They are
difficult. There should be some evidence of intent.
  Now, in the case of Johnson v. City of Santa Clara, your point
may be very well taken that the oral interview, if it had been ex-
plored in a little more depth, may have shown some intention to
exclude women, and there is a tough case, there is no question
about it.
  I just bring that up for whatever it is worth, because I would like
the Justices to think about the real world, real people out there
who really aren't intending to discriminate. And if you just use the
statistical disparity to make final determinations, you can create
an awful lot of bad law and an awful lot of expense to the small
business community that may very well not be willing to discrimi-
nate.
  Let me just ask you this: You agree, I trust, that the first amend-
ment right of free speech--frankly, I don't think I have enough
time to go through this line of questions, so I think what I will do,
Mr. Chairman--and you will be real happy with this--I will defer
until the next round before I go into the next round of questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Does that mean you are giving your ZV2. minutes
up to Senator Kennedy?
  Senator HATCH. I will reserve whatever time I have. How is
that?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
                                      133
  Senator HATCH. But if Senator Kennedy needs it, he can surely
have it.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to just review with you, Judge Ginsburg, if I might,
what I think has been an extraordinary period of Supreme Court
history, and that is the progress that has been made on gender dis-
crimination, which your involvement, your position as an advocate,
as an educator, as a spokesperson, I think, has really been abso-
lutely remarkable.
  I think probably for our colleagues, maybe they have a full un-
derstanding and awareness in this committee, maybe they do in
the Senate, but certainly I think it is something that it is impor-
tant for the American people to know. I think you made some ref-
erence to it in response to the earlier questions by Chairman
Biden.
  But virtually up until 1971, the courts upheld every kind of gen-
der discrimination. I was here in 1964 when we passed title VII of
the Civil Rights Act to try to move us toward eliminating discrimi-
nation on the basis of gender. And still we found up until 1971--
and we will come back to that--every kind of gender discrimina-
tion, from outright prohibitions on the entry of women into many
professions to more subtle gender classifications that did just as
much harm by perpetuating stereotypes about women and their
role in society.
  In 1873, the Supreme Court upheld a State law prohibiting
women from entering the legal profession. In 1948, the Court
upheld a State law prohibiting a woman from serving as a bar-
tender unless her husband or father owned the bar. In 1961, the
Court unanimously held that it was not a violation of equal protec-
tion or due process to limit jury service by women to only those
women who volunteer for jury duty, while substantially all men
were required to serve.
  Even after the 1964 act, even more outrageous policies discrimi-
nating against women existed in the private workplace. In Phillips
v. Martin-Marietta, the company absolutely barred women with
preschool-aged children from applying for work. Even a man with
sole custody of and responsibility for young children could apply,
but the lower courts did not perceive this policy as discriminating
against women. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed the lower
courts, and I note that you have written that during the argument
of the case before the Supreme Court, members of the High Court
made light of the notion that they themselves might have to hire
"lady lawyers" as law clerks. I know that you encountered the same
discrimination as a young law school graduate.
  So you had the perpetuation of gender discrimination in a long
line of Supreme Court decisions. You had some action by the Con-
gress. You still had rampant gender discrimination in the private
sector. These kinds of barriers to equal opportunity only began to
fall in the 1970's as a result of the litigation effort that you led.
Your painstaking work led the Burger Court to take strides for-
ward that would have been hard to imagine even a decade earlier.
  I was interested when you referred to this in our conversations
prior to the confirmation hearing in our wonderful visit that we
had in our Senate offices, where I inquired about your own back-
                                      134
ground. I want to pick up on some of the themes that I found so
moving in your excellent statement in the Rose Garden about your
mother and your own past.

  I was just wondering what it was in your own experience that
really led you to take this path, to devote so much of your career
to breaking down the legal barriers to the advancement of the
women in our society.

  Judge GINSBURG. It came on me incrementally, one might say.
There were many indignities one accepted as just part of the sce-
nery, just the way it was. For example, when I was at Harvard
Law School, I was on the Law Review and I was sent to check a
periodical in Lamont Library in the old periodical room. When I got
there, it was quite late at night, and I wanted to make sure I got
home by midnight. My daughter, the professor, was then 14
months old--no, that was my second year, so she was a few months
over 2 years old. And I wanted to look up the citation, report back,
and return home.

  There was a man at the door, and he said, "You can't come in."
"Well, why can't I come in?" "Because you're a female." "But the
library at Harvard is open to women," I protested, "Widener is
open to women." This one room in Lamont, however, remained a
symbol of the way things were. It was closed to women. There was
nothing I could do to open the door guarded by a university em-
ployee who said, "You can't enter that room."

  The Harvard Law Review had a banquet. I was allowed to invite
my spouse, and I was also allowed to invite my father or father-
in-law. But I wanted to invite my wonderful mother-in-law, who
has been, next to my husband, my biggest booster, the greatest
supporter imaginable. But I couldn't invite her because the Law
Review dinner was just for men. The couple of women who were
on Law Review--there were two of us--were allowed to come, but
not the wives of the men on the Review and no mothers, only fa-
thers.

  Experiences like that and the trouble I had getting a job when
I finished law school, all

  Senator KENNEDY. Maybe you would mention the difference be-
tween Cornell and Harvard in terms of where your dormitory was.

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. That was amusing.
  Cornell, in the days I was there, had a 4-to-l ratio. It had four
men for every woman. The reason they gave for having that quota
in the Arts and Science college--it was indeed a restrictive quota
system--was that the girls had to live on campus, the boys could
live in town. The men could find apartments and live in town, but
the girls needed to be sheltered, to have curfews and check-ins.
And there were only a certain number of dormitory spaces.
  Then I enroll in the Harvard Law School, and there is a fine
complex of dormitories, but all the rooms are reserved for men. No
places in Holmes Hall for the girls. The girls had to find their own
places in town.
  So it was just the reverse. Harvard's scheme compared to
Cornell's showed how irrational it all was.
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU also had an incident involving an eating
room at the faculty club.
                                      135
  Judge GINSBURG. Oh, yes. That was many years later in 1971.
I visited Harvard Law School to teach a course on women and the
law. It was the first such course Harvard offered. The faculty club,
the Harvard Faculty Club, up until that 1971 fall term, had the
dining room and the ladies' dining room. If you were a lady, until
that term, you didn't have a choice. You went to the ladies' dining
room.
  I asked to be seated in the dining room and the hostess said to
me, "Well, dear, you are allowed to dine in the Dining Room, but
wouldn't you really feel more comfortable in the Ladies' Dining
Room?"
  The CHAIRMAN. What did you say, Judge?
  Judge GINSBURG. I can tell you what I did. I had my meal in the
dining room. The way the world was just a generation or two ago
is something that, as I said before, today young people can hardly
grasp.
  One of my favorite stories concerned a case, a men's rights case,
an early title VII case called Diaz v. Pan American WorldAirways
(1971). The plaintiff was a man who wanted to be a cabin attend-
ant, but that particular airline hired only women. You may remem-
ber the days of "I'm Cheryl, fly me." The Diaz case was part of that
era.
  I was having lunch with some law school colleagues at the U.N.
dining room where we met to discuss a proposed commercial law
treaty. And one of the men said to me, "I understand what you are
doing, Ruth, and it is great you are all for equality, and we are,
too. But some of this is getting beyond reason. You know about
that case of a guy who wants to be a stewardess? Isn't that silly?"
  The waitress serving our table came to my aid. She said, "Pardon
me, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. I just came
back to the United States on Alitalia, and on that plane there was
the most adorable steward." The men turned to me, and one said,
"Ruth, do women look at men that way?" And I said, "You're darn
right we do." [Laughter.]
  Senator KENNEDY. Well [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. YOU asked for it, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. AS we were proceeding along, I think in our
visit in the office you also reviewed, and I think the record has
brought out your experiences after graduation, the difficulties you
had, with one of the most extraordinary academic records, both at
Columbia and Harvard and in getting employment, and then your
visit and travels overseas, and then back and eventually on the
Rutgers Law School faculty.
  Can you tell us just a little bit about when you started working,
as I understand it, with the ACLU on gender discrimination cases
while you were teaching there in the late 1960's? What was the
first case you took to the Court, and can you tell us a little bit
about it?
  Judge GINSBURG. The first series of cases I handled were not big
Federal cases. Many States had moved ahead of the Congress. The
1964 title VII legislation trailed a number of States that had al-
ready enacted State human rights laws, States that in some in-
stances included sex along with race, national origin, and religion
as a proscribed basis for discrimination.
                                      136
  I got into the sex equality advocacy business through two doors:
one was opened by my students who, in the late 1960's and early
1970's, encouraged the faculty to offer a course in this area; the
other was opened by complaints that began to trickle into the New
Jersey affiliate of the ACLU. I will describe a typical one: A school
teacher becomes pregnant, and is told she must leave work--in the
third month or the fourth, or as the pregnancy begins to show. She
is put on what was euphemistically called maternity leave, which
meant no pay, no benefits, no health benefits. "We will call you
back if we have a need for you." That was about the size of it.
  Many of the women in that situation were schoolteachers. Some
were in other fields.
  I recall another typical case, one involving the Lipton Tea Co.
The complainant's employer had a fine health plan. Her husband's
employer didn't have an equally fine plan. So she wanted to sign
up with her employer to get the more advantageous plan for her-
self, her spouse, and her children. And she was told, "Women can
get health coverage under our plan only for themselves. We have
family coverage only for male workers." That was another category
of case.
  Senator KENNEDY. SO you had Reed v. Reed in 1971, which is the
case that was referred to earlier, the Idaho case involving a law
that required that males must be preferred to females in handling
the decedent's estate. That was the first occasion on which, as I un-
derstand, the Court held a gender-based classification inconsistent
with the equal protections of the laws. Frontiero (1973) has just
been referenced earlier, and in that case, as I understand it, the
wives were presumed to be dependent on the husbands, and you
had to show--the husband had to prove he was dependent on the
wife. Therefore, as I understand it, this was where Justice Bren-
nan's opinion recognized this as an example of gender stereotyping.
The law assumes that wives would be financially dependent on the
spouses, but husbands would not. And he noted that traditionally
such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of romantic pa-
ternalism, which in practical effect put women not on a pedestal
but in a cage.
  As was mentioned earlier, in the Frontiero case, Justice Bren-
nan's opinion applied the strict scrutiny test. You mentioned earlier
the different tests which are applied in terms of economic regula-
tion, race, and gender discrimination. He supported or applied a
strict scrutiny test, which gathered four votes in favor at that
point. But it would still take additional cases before the Supreme
Court would raise, as I understand, the level of scrutiny.
  The Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 1975, is a particularly moving
case. I know that you remember it well, and I know that you have
maintained an interest in the individuals involved. I wonder if you
would just share with us briefly the history of cases involving gen-
der discrimination.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, I think you will hear from Stephen
Wiesenfeld later. I would like to go back even before Reed (1971)
so that it can be understood what the state of precedent was like,
what led Justice Brennan to say the pedestal has sometimes been
a cage.
                                      137
  The case is Hoyt v. Florida; it yielded a 1961 decision from the
liberal Warren Court. You recited it correctly. The question was
whether women would be required to serve on juries just as men
are required to serve, or whether, as Florida had it, women could
serve if they wanted to, but would not summoned for jury duty.
Women who wanted to serve would have to come to the clerk's of-
fice to sign up. Not surprisingly, very few did. This was the case.
  A woman, Gwendolyn Hoyt, had a philandering husband who
had humiliated her to the breaking point regularly. We didn't use
names like "battered women" in those days. We just said, "She does
not have a happy marriage." One day, enraged by the humiliation
to which she was exposed, Gwendolyn Hoyt turned to the corner
of the room and spied her young son's baseball bat. It was a broken
baseball bat. She took the bat and brought it down on her hus-
band's head, ending both the fight and husband, and starting the
prosecution for murder.
  Hoyt argued that having women on the jury--or at least in the
pool from which the jury would be picked, improving the chances
she would have women in that jury room--would yield better com-
prehension of her state of mind, her utter frustration, and might
lead to her conviction of something less than murder.
  The Court in 1961 responded to her plea--she was indeed con-
victed of murder by the all-male jury. Hoyt complained that the
jury pool was not drawn from a fair cross-section of the community
because women were left out. The Court said Florida's scheme was
pure favor to women. They had the best of both worlds. They could
serve if they wanted to. They had only to sign up in the clerk's of-
fice. They didn't have to serve if they didn't want to, so what was
the complaint about? Women were treated better than men. Appar-
ently, little thought was given to Gwendolyn Hoyt and the murder
charge affirmed in her case.
  Now, let's proceed from 1961 to--I think the Wiesenfeld case
began in 1973.
  Senator KENNEDY. It ended in 1975, the citation I have.
  Judge GlNSBURG. A young man, Stephen Weisenfeld, had a tragic
experience. His wife Paula died in childbirth. She had had an en-
tirely healthy pregnancy, and he was told that he had a healthy
baby boy but his wife had died. He determined that day to be a
caregiving parent to his child, Jason Weisenfeld.
  Stephen Weisenfeld went to the local Social Security office and
asked about the benefits he thought a sole surviving parent could
get. He was informed that the benefit he sought was called a moth-
er's benefit, and that he didn't qualify.
  So as I recall, he wrote a letter to the editor of his local news-
paper. The letter began, "I have heard a lot about women's lib. Let
me tell you my story." He told about his wife having been a wage
earner, having paid the same Social Security tax that a man would
pay, about her death and how he didn't qualify as a caregiving par-
ent because he was a male.
  He ended the letter with the line, "Tell that to Gloria Steinem."
He was tired of hearing about "women's lib." His case was the per-
fect example of how gender-based discrimination hurts everyone.
  The discrimination started with his wife, who worked as a man
did, who paid Social Security tax as any wage earner does, but
                                      138

whose Government said, in effect, we don't protect your family the
way we protect the family of a male wage earner.

  And then there was Stephen Wiesenfeld himself, who wanted to
care for his child, but was informed there were no benefits for him
to do that, because he was a father, not a mother. Also there was
Jason, the son of Paula and Stephen, who would not have the op-
portunity to have the care of his sole surviving parent, for the sole
reason that it was his mother, not his father, who had died.

  The case resulted in a unanimous judgment in Stephen
Wiesenfeld's favor. Every Justice voted to strike down the gender-
based classification. The majority said it discriminated against the
woman as wage earner. Others said it discriminated against the
man as parent. And one said it discriminated against the baby.

  That case, more than any other, I believe, shows the irrationality
of gender-based classification.

  Senator KENNEDY. And you stayed in touch with the family, as
I understand, is that correct?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, and I am pleased to say that Jason, who
I don't think was yet 3 at the time of the Supreme Court victory,
is nowln his last year in college, and his father tells me he's going
to apply to law school.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, these cases are very important and sig-
nificant on the legal issues and certainly equally important in
terms of the human implications, and, obviously, your role in this
was absolutely essential.

  I want to just move along through these cases, starting in 1971
and continuing through 1975, and then finally the Craig v. Boren
case, which held that gender-based distinctions by Government are
invalid, unless shown to be "substantially related to an important
government interest." So we have the striking down of gender-
based discrimination and putting in place a heightened standard of
review by the Supreme Court. That obviously has been an extraor-
dinary achievement and accomplishment in striking down the bar-
riers of discrimination in our society, and I think it is important
for us to understand it.

  You have obviously had a wealth of experience with the gender
discrimination, both firsthand experience and through cases you
have handled, and I would like to just move into the questions
about what this has meant to you in terms of sensitizing you to
other issues of discrimination--how it affects your own thinking as
a judge, but also your own sensitivity to other forms of discrimina-
tion suffered by many others in our society.

  I think you are very much aware of the continued kinds of dis-
crimination, even gender discrimination and wage discrimination
that exists in our society, and unequal remedies which are avail-
able for people, remedies which differ on the basis of gender. So
those are matters that we are going to be addressing certainly in
the Congress, but they do continue.

  On the issue of civil rights, Congress and the President took up
the challenge in the 1960's with the landmark civil rights bills. In
the earlier period of time in the 19th century, Congress passing
powerful laws, and they were effectively gutted by the Supreme
Court. Then m the first 60 years of this century leadership in fight-
ing discrimination basically fell to the Supreme Court. Congress
                                      139

and the President took up the challenges in the 1960's and impor-
tant progress was made.

  Then we have seen action that was necessary in the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, a bipartisan bill, to deal with the series of decisions
by the Supreme Court in the 1980's that many of us believed have
weakened the protections available to victims of employment dis-
crimination.

  I had intended to go through a number of the items on the civil
rights issues which I think are important, and we will have a
chance to review those in a second round. Maybe others will get to
those issues. In Shaw v. Library of Congress, you showed sensitiv-
ity on the issue of attorneys fees, and then the Supreme Court
treated that issue differently, and in the 1991 Civil Rights Act Con-
gress overruled that decision.

  Then there were other decisions such as Spann v. Colonial Vil-
lage, on the Fair Housing Act, to challenge the use of all-white
models in advertising for rental housing. You wrote an opinion
holding that organizations dedicated to ensuring fair housing op-
portunity had standing to bring that suit, because they suffered
real injury, when African-Americans were steered away from apart-
ment complexes that used only white models in advertising.

  As someone who is a sponsor of that Fair Housing Act, along
with others on this committee, I was struck by the appreciation
that you showed in your opinion for the need for private enforce-
ment actions against this kind in discrimination.

  Then in Wright v. Regan, you ruled that the parents of African-
American school children had standing to challenge the fact that
the Internal Revenue Service had allowed private schools that
banned blacks to have tax-exempt status. The Court overturned
you on the issue of standing, but eventually on the substance of the
issue, in the Bob Jones case, certainly it supported the basic and
fundamental principle that the IRS could deny tax-exempt status.

  Perhaps in just the couple of minutes I have left--you take what
time that you need, but I will not be able to inquire further of
you--if you could go back perhaps to the experience that you had
with regard to gender discrimination, I think some of these cases
that I mentioned at least for me demonstrate a sensitivity on the
issues of race discrimination.

  You also wrote an opinion in Walker v. Jones applying the civil
rights laws to Members of Congress, which was a welcome decision
as well.

  Perhaps you could tell us in your own words, in whatever way
you care to, about how your experience on gender discrimination
has sensitized you on the issues of discrimination generally, on the
issues of civil rights, and other forms of discrimination which we
face in our society. What may we expect of you?

  Judge GiNSBURG. Senator Kennedy, I am alert to discrimination.
I grew up during World War II in a Jewish family. I have memo-
ries as a child, even before the war, of being in a car with my par-
ents and passing a place in Senator Specter's State, a resort with
a sign out in front that read: "No dogs or Jews allowed." Signs of
that kind existed in this country during my childhood. One couldn't
help but be sensitive to discrimination, living as a Jew in America
at the time of World War II.
                                      140

  Then there was the tremendous debt the women's movement
owed to the civil rights movement of the sixties, in the development
of legal theories. There is also some crossover.

  You mentioned the case of Ida Phillips v. Martin-Marietta, the
1971 Supreme Court decision, the first title VII sex discrimination
case to come before the Court. That case was brought by the
NAACP, Inc. Fund, although Ida Phillips was a white woman. The
employer said we won't hire or retain women with preschool-age
children. Although Ida Phillips was white, the NAACP, Inc. Fund
appreciated what a devastating effect a rule like that would have
on black women who were seeking to gain or retain employment.

  People who have known discrimination are bound to be sympa-
thetic to discrimination encountered by others, because they under-
stand how it feels to be exposed to disadvantageous treatment for
reasons that have nothing to do with one's ability, or the contribu-
tions one can make to society.

  Senator KENNEDY. I thank you. My time is up, but I want to
thank Judge Ginsburg for revealing not only the brilliance of her
mind, but I think the quality of her soul and heart, as well.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, this would be an appropriate time to take
a break, if you would like, or we can continue for one more Senator
and then take a break. Do you have a preference?
  Judge GINSBURG. Then we will have
  The CHAIRMAN. In other words, we need to take a break now or
in 30 minutes.
  Judge GINSBURG. Why don't we go another 30 minutes and then
take a break, if that is satisfactory.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is fine.
  Mr. Chairman.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, several educators in South Carolina have re-
quested I propound four questions to you, and in preparing these
questions or any others I may propound during the hearings, if you
feel they are inappropriate to answer, will you speak out and say
so.
  The first is, many parents feel that public school education is
lacking. What are your views on the constitutionality of some form
of voucher system, so that working and middle-class parents can
receive more choice in selecting the best education available for
their children?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, aid to schools is a question
that comes up again and again before the Supreme Court. This is
the very kind of question that I ruled out.
  Senator THURMOND. Would you prefer not to answer?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, you feel free to express yourself on any
of these.
  Next is, based upon your understanding of the U.S. Constitution,
do communities, cities, counties, and States have sufficient flexibil-
ity to experiment with and provide for diverse educational environ-
ments aided by public funding and geared to the particular needs
of individual students of their particular area of jurisdiction?
                                      141
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, that is the kind of ques-
tions that a judge cannot answer at-large. The judge will consider
a specific program in a specific school situation, together with the
legal arguments for or against that program, but it cannot be an-
swered in the abstract. As you so well know, judges work from the
particular case, not from the general proposition.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge, some recent studies underscored the
historical precedent in the United States and elsewhere to the ef-
fect that single-sex education may be best for many students. Do
you care to express your views under the Constitution concerning
single-sex education, or do you think single-sex education should be
available for girls and boys, young women and young men, aided
by public funding?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I can say only this: The Constitution
requires that equal opportunity be given for boys and girls, equal
opportunity for education. I will report on one class of cases in
which I was involved. They were easy cases, because there was an
exclusion, an imbalance in opportunity.
  I worked at Rutgers University for 9 years. The main college was
all-male when I began working there. There was also a very fine
school, Douglas, much smaller, for women. But the State had many
more places for male students than it had for female students.
That was wrong. The way it was eventually cured was fine. Rut-
gers opened its doors to female students, the women's college re-
mained separate. I think it remains separate to this day. But the
State can't say we are going to have separate education and we are
going to have many more places for men than for women.
  Other cases in which I was involved concerned Princeton, a pri-
vate university. Princeton had a wonderful program for sixth grad-
ers. That program took sixth graders from the community and gave
them an enriched learning experience, an introduction to math and
science. The program included followup instruction in the students'
high school years. This program was designed for children who
were disadvantage*!, children who did not go to private schools.
They went to public schools and they lived in neighborhoods that
weren't affluent. It was a wonderful program, but it was only for
boys.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge, do you believe it is desirable that sin-
gle-sex education should be available on some basis for the working
and middle-class parents, and not just available to those who can
afford to send their children to exclusive private schools?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, I have expressed my view
that the Constitution requires that the State treat people, boys and
girls, equally. The cases I have described to you all involved either
separate and nonexistent for girls, or separate and not equal. That
is as far as my experience goes.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, it is my firm belief that the
responsibility of the Congress is to make the laws. The executive
branch is to execute the laws, and the role of the judiciary is to in-
terpret the laws. Clearly, there are times when the responsibilities
of the three branches of government will overlap.
  However, this is in stark contrast to activities conducted by one
branch which are the distinct prerogatives of another. It has been
said that you agree with Harvard Law Prof. Lawrence Tribe, that
                                      142
it is notion that the different branches of the Federal Government
must be limited to the exercise of the powers specifically within
their own sphere of authority.

  Another constitutional commentator, James Madison, in the 47th
Federalist, has argued that the preservation of liberty requires that
the three great departments should be separate and distinct. If you
are in agreement with Professor Tribe over James Madison on this
issue, when do you believe it is appropriate for the Federal courts,
including the Supreme Court, to engage in what would tradition-
ally be considered a legislative activity?

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Tribe has finally gotten his true billing
compared to James Madison.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think James Madison had it absolutely right.
He explained that ours is a system of separate branches of Govern-
ment, but the very idea Professor Tribe expressed you will find in
another of the Federalist papers; that is, each branch is given by
the Constitution a little space in the other's territory. We see that
in operation today. The judiciary is separate and independent, but
I can't be a Federal judge unless you, the legislators, advise and
consent. You make the laws, but the President can veto laws that
you pass.

  Senator THURMOND. Of course, we can override him, you know.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, but only by a super-majority. So the Con-
stitution has divided government, but it also has checks and bal-
ances, and it makes each branch a little dependent on the other.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, in a 1981 George Law Re-
view article--oh, by the way, I am glad you agree with James
Madison. I meant to say that. [Laughter.]
  In a 1981 Georgia Law Review article, I believe you stated that
the need for judicial interventionist decisions would be reduced sig-
nificantly if elected officials shouldered the full responsibility for
activist decisionmaking. I understood this to be your response to
the Court's difficulty on occasion determining congressional intent
in legislative acts.
  If confirmed as Associate Justice, what criteria will you use and
where will you place the boundaries of your own interpretation of
congressional acts which you find ambiguous and lacking clarity?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, as I have told Senator
Hatch in our conversations, there is nothing that a judge would
like better than to have a highly activist legislature passing the
laws, making clear its positions on policy and on implementation.
  The tremendous difference between legislators who decide what
policies should be, then write laws to implement those policies, and
judges is that you design the plate and you put things on it. Judges
never make business for themselves. Judges don't create cases.
Cases come to court, brought by parties; and if it is a case of what
James Madison called a judiciary nature, then the judges have no
choice. They must decide it, no matter how much they would like
to avoid decision.
  Judge Irving Goldberg of the fifth circuit described it--and I
quoted him in that University of Georgia article--this way: He
compared judges to firefighters. They don't light the fire, but they
are obliged to put it out. Judges are reactive. They don't make the
cases or controversies that come before them, but if they are proper
                                      143
judicial cases, judges are obliged to decide them no matter how un-
popular the decision may be to some group or another.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, my next question is di-
rectly related to this issue of judicial activism. As you may know,
House and Senate conferees are meeting to determine the fate of
President Clinton's tax proposal. There has been spirited discourse,
publicly and within the Congress, on whether there is a need to
raise the taxes of the American people.

  The power to tax is an awesome power. As elected officials with
this power, we are directly accountable to the American people for
our actions. For over 200 years, consent to taxation has come
through the ballot box. This has been fundamental in our history
for over 200 years. In fact, a resolution adopted by the Stamp Act
Congress in 1765, protesting excise duties imposed by Great Brit-
ain on the Colonies, stated, and I quote, "It is inseparably essential
to the freedom of a people that no taxes be imposed on them but
with their own consent given personally by their representatives."
Yet this fundamental principle was turned on its head in the Mis-
souri v. Jenkins decision, with which I presume you are familiar,
handed down by the Supreme Court in 1990.

  Essentially, the Jenkins decision grants the power to the Federal
courts to order new taxes or tax increases to carry out a judicial
remedy. It is my firm belief that the American people lack ade-
quate protection when they are subject to taxation by unelected
life-tenured Federal judges. It is worrisome enough to the Amer-
ican people that the majority party in the Congress is trying to
raise their taxes, to which, I might add, I am opposed, without hav-
ing to worry about the same treatment from the Federal courts.

  As James Madison stated in Federalist No. 48, "The legislative
branch alone has access to the pockets of the people."

  I introduced legislation to alter the Jenkins decision to preclude
the lower Federal courts from issuing any order or decree requiring
the imposition of any new tax or to increase any existing tax or tax
rates. I firmly believe that the Constitution explicitly reserves the
power to tax to the legislative branch where representatives are ac-
countable for unnecessary taxes. This matter has yet to be acted
on by the Congress.

  My question is: Do you believe there is sound constitutional au-
thority for the American people to be exposed to taxation unless it
is imposed by proper legislative authority?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, may I put the Jenkins case
in its context, as I understand it, and preface my response with
Madison's words about the Federal courts James Madison said that
with the Bill of Rights, he anticipated that the Federal courts
would consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of
the rights incorporated in the Bill of Rights. He expected the
judges to be an impenetrable bulwark, naturally led to resist every
encroachment upon rights stipulated for in the Constitution by the
Declaration of Rights.

  One of those rights, after adoption of the 14th amendment, is the
right to equal protection of the laws. What was involved in that
case, as I understand, was desegregation in schools. Federal courts
don't make those cases. Every judge I know who has been involved
in one has found it distressing, stressful, not what that judge
                                      144
would choose to do. And every effort is made in those cases to have
the community decide for itself, to come up with a plan that will
cure a violation of rights.

  Once a violation of rights, of constitutional rights, is proved, then
it becomes the Court's responsibility to impose relief, to grant re-
lief, to work out a remedy. Now, courts will work out a remedy
themselves only as the very last resort, after trying in every way
possible to have the people's elected representatives do the job that
they should do.

  I can't talk to the specifics of this particular case, but I do know
that no judge, no Federal judge, to my knowledge, ever invites this
kind of case. When the case comes to court, the judges will do ev-
erything they can to have the remedy worked out among the people
involved in the case. And only when nothing else works will the
judge then step in and fulfill, as best as she or he can, the judge's
constitutional responsibility.

  Senator THURMOND. AS I mentioned earlier, my legislation would
alter the Jenkins decision to preclude the Federal court from using
taxation as part of a judicial remedy. This bill does not affect the
subject matter jurisdiction of the courts, but limits their remedial
discretion. Now we will move on to another subject.

  Judge Ginsburg, in Shaw v. Reno (1993), which was handed
down by the Supreme Court last month, the Court remanded to the
district court the appellant's claim under the equal protection
clause which alleged that a North Carolina reapportionment plan
was so irrational on its face that it could be understood only as an
effort to segregate voters into separate districts on the basis of race
and that the separation lacked sufficient justification.

  One vocal critic of this decision said that the Supreme Court has
now created an entirely new constitutional right for white people.
Judge Ginsburg, do you believe this to be an accurate assessment
of the Shaw decision? And if confirmed, how will you approach
challenges to reapportionment plans under the equal protection
clause?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Thurmond, the Shaw (1993) case to
which you referred was returned to a lower court. The chance that
it will return again to a higher court is hardly remote. It is hardly
remote for that very case. It is almost certain that other cases like
it will come up. These are very taxing questions. I think the Su-
preme Court already has redistricting cases on its docket for next
year, so this is the very kind of question it would be injudicious for
me to address.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you.
  Judge Ginsburg, as you may know, Congress has before it a pro-
posed amendment to the Constitution which would mandate the
Federal Government to achieve and maintain a balanced budget. I
am a strong supporter of the balanced budget amendment. I have
worked on this for over 20 years. Should the amendment become
part of our Constitution, do you believe that individual taxpayers
would have standing to bring suit in Federal court to force the Con-
gress to adhere to its mandate?
  Judge GINSBURG. YOU have described a measure that you support
and, therefore, hope and expect may someday pass. That being the
                                      145
case, you are describing a future controversy that may very well
come before the Court.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, you don't have to answer it, then, if
you feel that you shouldn't.

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, there are hundreds upon
hundreds of inmates currently under death sentences across the
country. Here in the Congress I have been advocating habeas cor-
pus reform to bring about finality of judgment in capital cases.
  Please tell this committee your views on the validity of placing
some reasonable limitations on post-trial appeals that allow in-
mates under death sentences to avoid execution for years after
commission of their crimes. Some of these cases go on for many
years. For example, one in my State went for 10 or 11 years; one
I believe in the State of Utah, Senator Hatch's State, went for 16
years.
  Judge GINSBURG. I know, Senator Thurmond, that there is in
this area a great tension between two important principles. The
one to which you have referred is finality. All things must come to
an end, and that is important in the law. Controversies must be
decided, and people must go on about their business. So finality is
important.
  But fairness is also important and, unfortunately, we don't live
in an ideal world where people get the best representation the first
time they come to court.
  Senator THURMOND. Suppose they do have good representation?
  Judge GINSBURG. These concerns, finality and fairness, are in
tension, and they must be balanced in the particular case. I should
add that, unlike Federal judges in many other places, judges in the
District of Columbia Circuit do not have experience with the kind
of habeas petitions you have in mind. Congress, when it created
the separate District of Columbia court system, established courts
with judges appointed by the President, gave them a postconviction
remedy that is identical to 2255 of title 28, the Federal
postconviction remedy, and then indicated, you go from the District
of Columbia courts to the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court
will take your case. There is no Federal habeas review when you
get through with the District of Columbia courts. So we don't get
the kind of habeas corpus business that the fourth circuit and the
other regional circuits get.
  So I appreciate the tension between finality and fairness. I have
not had the experience that some of my colleagues on the Federal
bench have had with the habeas jurisdiction.
  Senator THURMOND. It is my belief that the public loses respect
for the courts when the case is tried and the sentence is given and
it is 10 years later or 15 years later before the sentence takes ef-
fect. We have got to do something to bring finality to these matters.
If you remember, Justice Rehnquist appointed a commission with
Justice Powell to make recommendations on habeas corpus reform.
The Congress has been considering the Powell report.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I understand that Congress has and will
continue to give consideration to the Powell report.
  Senator THURMOND. I welcome your statement and your commit-
tee questionnaire response that judges must avoid capitulating to
                                     146
a result or any criticism. I especially welcome your approving ref-
erence to Prof. Gerald Gunther's discussion of Chief Justice Mar-
shall's 1832 opinion in Worcester v. Georgia. As Professor Gunther
explains, when John Marshall and his fellow Justices voted in that
case, they generally believed that the decision might well mean the
end of effective Court authority, but they also thought that it was
legally right. And, unflinchingly, they did their duty. They decided
the case on merits, even though the immediate prospects were anx-
iety-producing, even though the survival of the Court was truly at
stake.

  If a decision is right on the merits, it should be handed down,
despite fears about consequences. This approach, which you sound-
ly praise, contrasts sharply with the approach taken by five Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court last year in the Casey decision. In the
past, Chief Justice Marshall did what he believed was right regard-
less of the possible effect on the Court's public standing. By con-
trast, five Justices relied on concerns over the Court's perceived le-
gitimacy in the public's eyes in deciding not to overrule the con-
stitutional error made in Roe v. Wade.

  As Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent, instead of engaging in
the hopeless task of predicting public perception, a job not for law-
yers but for political campaign managers, the Justices should do
what is legally right. I am pleased to see that you are with Chief
Justice Marshall and Justice Scalia on this principle.

  Would you care to make any further comment?
  Judge GINSBURG. I think that every Justice of the Supreme
Court and every Federal judge would subscribe to the principle
that a judge must do what he or she determines to be legally right.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are good, Judge. You are real good.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, in 1975, at a meeting of the
ACLU board of directors that you attended, the board adopted a
policy statement that declared the ACLU opposed limitations on
the custody and visitation rights of parents where such limitations
are based solely on the parent's sexual preference. However, that
statement did not claim that such limitations are unconstitutional.
  My question for you is this: Putting aside your views on the wis-
dom of any such limitations, do you have any doubt that a State
is free, if it wishes, under the Constitution to take into account a
parent's sexual preference in awarding custody and visitation
rights and to limit those rights solely because of that preference?
Similarly, could a State, in your view, if it so desired, limit adop-
tion rights to heterosexuals, or do you feel that that might come
before the Supreme Court?
  Judge GINSBURG. From the announcements we have seen in the
paper today, yes, the questions that you have outlined certainly
could come up.
  Senator THURMOND. I will not press you to answer any that you
feel are inappropriate.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Ginsburg, one very important area of
the law is the question of whether courts exceed their authority by
creating rights of action for private litigants under Federal statutes
where Congress did not expressly provide such rights of action, and
Justice Powell put it this way:
                                             147

  In Article III, Congress alone has the responsibility for determining the jurisdic-
tion of the lower Federal courts. As the legislative branch, Congress should also de-
termine when private parties are to be given causes of action under legislation it
adopts. As countless statutes demonstrate, including titles of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, Congress recognizes that the creation of private actions is a legislative func-
tion and frequently exercises it. When Congress chooses not to provide a private
civil remedy, Federal courts should not assume the legislative role of creating such
a remedy, and thereby enlarge that jurisdiction.

  As a general matter, what do you think of Justice Powell's argu-
ment?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Congress should express itself plainly on the
question of private rights of action. Judges would welcome clear ex-
pression by Congress with great enthusiasm. Judges do not lightly
imply private rights of action. In some areas of the law, securities
law, for example, where private rights of action have been under-
stood by the courts to be the legislature's intention--and that is al-
ways what the Court is trying to divine--it appears that the legis-
lature has been content with those implications. Congress has let
those private rights stand now in some cases for even decades.

  Judges have said often enough in their opinions, we are going to
try to find out, try to determine as best we can, whether Congress
intended that there be a private right of action. We wish that Con-
gress would speak precisely to this question, because, as you said,
Senator, the existence of a private right of action is a question for
Congress to decide.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, I believe my time is up. Thank you
for your presence here on this occasion.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Judge you are obviously doing very well. Do you know how I
know that? Three-quarters of the press has left. [Laughter.]
  The print media has left, not the important ones, but three-quar-
ters of the press has left, which means that they assume you have
been confirmed.
  We will, as I indicated, take a break now for 10 minutes, and
when we return we will go at least through Senator Metzenbaum
and possibly through Senator Simpson. We have a little conflict
here. I said we would end by 6:30. If we get both, we are going to
go until 7:15 or so. We are going to check with my colleagues to
see what is the most appropriate. If you have a preference, you can
let your staff know in the break and we will take that into consid-
eration.
  We will now recess until quarter after. If we start sharp at quar-
ter after, we can get a lot done.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, I have conferred with my colleagues and your staff on
what we will do. We will proceed now with the distinguished Sen-
ator from Ohio--and I will say this for the 15th time, what great
regret I have that he is leaving at the end of this term, choosing
not to run again--who will begin the questioning. Then I am going
to have to leave here at 5 of 7, and the distinguished chairman of
the Agriculture Committee and a member of this committee, Chair-
man Leahy, has agreed that he will preside until Senator Simpson,
who will be here, has his round of questioning.
                                      148

  As you know by the Senate rules, we don't trust an operation
where there is no Democrat present. That is a joke. We totally
trust the distinguished Senator from Maine.

  Senator LEAHY. It is just that I need the experience, that is what
it is. That is what he is trying to say.

  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to also explain why at 5 of 7 or 8
minutes of 7 I get up and walk out. It is not out of disrespect.

  So let me now turn it over to Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I am happy to see you here, Judge Ginsburg.
  Before I begin my questions, I thought that it might be appro-
priate to make a brief response to Senator Thurmond's remarks
about the need for finality in death penalty cases. This committee
held a hearing on the death penalty with two witnesses who were
sentenced to death, but later freed because they were innocent, to-
tally innocent. They were close to losing their lives.
  One was an Alabama black man who had been in the peniten-
tiary for 6 years. Another was a Texas white man who was in the
penitentiary for 10 years. Just this month, a Maryland man was
released after 9 years in the penitentiary.
  I understand Senator Thurmond's point of view, but, frankly, we
have to be careful, because the finality of judgments in death sen-
tences can mean death for innocent persons. That really does not
relate specifically, Judge Ginsburg, but I did not want to leave the
record open with the implication that everybody who has been
found guilty and hasn't finished their rights of appeal should have
been executed.
  Judge Ginsburg, I have always believed it is important that the
men and women who serve on the Court have a good sense of the
reality that litigants face and the practical implications of their de-
cisions. I expect that your broad range of professional and personal
experiences would give you an understanding of the world faced by
the individuals who are before the Court.
  Having said that, I am frank to say that I am puzzled by your
often repeated criticisms of the decision in Roe v. Wade, that the
Court went too far and too fast. You stated the decision need only
have invalidated the Texas abortion law in question. You have also
stated that Roe curtailed a trend toward liberalization of State
abortion statutes.
  I am frank to say that some, including this Senator, would ques-
tion whether women really were making real progress towards ob-
taining reproductive freedom, when Roe was decided in 1973.
Would you be willing to explain your basis for making those state-
ments about Roe and the state of abortion law at the time of the
Roe decision?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Senator Metzenbaum, I will try. The state-
ment you made about the law moving in a reform direction is taken
directly from Justice Blackmun's decision in Roe (1973) itself. He
explained that, until recently, the law in the States had been over-
whelmingly like the Texas law, but that there had been a trend in
the direction of reform. The trend had proceded to the extent that
some one-third of the States, in a span of a very few years, had
reformed their abortion laws from the point where only the life of
the woman was protected. In relatively few years, one-third of the
                                      149
States had moved from that position to a variety of positions. Most
of the States followed the American Law Institute model, allowing
abortion on grounds of rape, incest, and some other grounds. Four
States had by then moved to permit abortion on the woman's re-
quest as advised by her doctor.

  So I took that statement not from any source other than the very
opinion, which I surely do not criticize for making that point. I ac-
cept it just as it was made in Roe v. Wade.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Would you not have had some concern, or
do you not have some concern that had the gradualism been the
reality, that many more women would have been denied an abor-
tion or would have been forced into an illegal abortion and possibly
an unsafe abortion?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, we can't see what the past might have
been like. I wrote an article that was engaging in "what if specula-
tion. I expressed the view that if the Court had simply done what
courts usually do, stuck to the very case before it and gone no fur-
ther, then there might have been a change, gradual changes.

  We have seen it happen in this country so many times. We saw
it with the law of marriage and divorce. In a span of some dozen
years, we witnessed a shift from adultery as the sole ground for di-
vorce to no-fault divorce in almost every State in the Union. Once
the States begin to change, then it takes a while, but eventually
most of them move in the direction of change.

  One can say this with certainty: There was a massive attack on
Roe v. Wade;the Court's opinion became a clear target at which to
aim. Two things happened. One side had a rallying cry, the other--
a movement that had been very vigorous--relaxed to some extent.
Pro-choice advocates didn't go home, but they were less vigorous
than they might have been had it not appeared that the Court had
taken care of the problem.

  So while one side seemed to relax its energy, the other side had
a single target around which to rally. My view is that if Roe had
been less sweeping, people would have accepted it more readily,
would have expressed themselves in the political arena in an en-
during way on this question. I recognize that this is a matter of
speculation. It is my view of "what if. Other people hold a different
view.

  Senator METZENBAUM. In the Roe case, the Supreme Court held
that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by
the Constitution. The Court said that constitutional right was fun-
damental and deserved the highest standard of protection from
government laws and regulations that interfere with the exercise
of the right. States had to have a compelling State interest to regu-
late the right to choose.

  In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,
the Court did not overrule Roe v. Wade.However, the case inCasey
lowered the standard for protecting a woman's right to choose. The
Court held that States may regulate the right to choose, as long as
they do not create an undue burden on women.

  After the Caseydecision, some have questioned whether the right
to choose is still a fundamental constitutional right. In your view,
does the Casey decision stand for the proposition that the right to
choose is a fundamental constitutional right?
                                      150
  Judge GlNSBURG. The Court itself has said after Casey (1992>--
I don't want to misrepresent the Supreme Court, so I will read its
own words. This is the statement of a majority of the Supreme
Court, including the dissenters in Casey:'The right to abortion is
one element of a more general right of privacy * * * or of Four-
teenth Amendment liberty." That is the Court's most recent state-
ment. It includes a citation to Roe v. Wade. The Court has once
again said that abortion is part of the concept of privacy or liberty
under the 14th amendment.
  What regulations will be permitted is certainly a matter likely to
be before the Court. Answers depend, in part, Senator, on the kind
of record presented to the Court. It would not be appropriate for
me to go beyond the Court's recent reaffirmation that abortion is
a woman's right guaranteed by the 14th amendment; it is part of
the liberty guaranteed by the 14th amendment.
  Perhaps I can say one thing more. It concerns an adjustment we
have seen moving from Roe to Casey. The Roe decision is a highly
medically oriented decision, not just in the three-trimester division.
Roe features, along with the right of the woman, the right of the
doctor to freely exercise his profession. The woman appears to-
gether with her consulting physician, and that pairing comes up
two or three times in the opinion, the woman, together with her
consulting physician.
  The Casey decision, at least the opinion of three of the Justices
in that case, makes it very clear that the woman is central to this.
She is now standing alone. This is her right. It is not her right in
combination with her consulting physician. The cases essentially
pose the question: Who decides; is it the State or the individual?
In Roe, the answer comes out: the individual, in consultation with
her physician. We see in the physician something of a big brother
figure next to the woman. The most recent decision, whatever else
might be said about it, acknowledges that the woman decides.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I won't go further into the Roe v. Wade
case, and let me change the subject on you a bit. For over 100
years, our fair competition laws have protected consumers against
monopolies and cartels that fix high prices, boycott smaller com-
petitors, or force consumers to buy unwanted merchandise, in order
to get the products they really want.
  As one prominent antitrust scholar correctly stated, our antitrust
laws are based on a distrust of power, a concern for consumers and
a commitment to opportunity for entrepreneurs. In other words,
their goal is to protect consumers and small competitors from un-
fair competition, although not all jurists share that view. Some be-
lieve that the only goal of the antitrust laws should be economic
efficiency which favors the financial interests of big business over
the best interests of smaller competitors and consumers.
  In the last two sessions, Supreme Court opinions have taken
both a proconsumer and a probig business economic view of anti-
trust. In the 1992 decision in Kodak v. Image Technical Services,
the Court adopted a decidedly proconsumer approach to the anti-
trust laws. The Court held that Kodak's business policies could be
anticompetitive, based on the extra time and money they cost con-
sumers. Those policies made it virtually impossible for Kodak's cus-
                                      151
tomers to buy replacement parts and repair services for copying
machines from smaller competitors.

  However, this term the Court seemed to change direction and it
adopted probig business approach to antitrust law based on eco-
nomic theory. In its decision in Brook Group v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco,the Court amazingly theorized that a small,
but powerful group of tobacco companies could not fix prices and
ruin a smaller competitor, despite the fact that the defendant com-
panies believed that they could. The dissent written by Justice Ste-
vens criticized the majority's reliance on economic theory to decide
the case, stating that they had relied on supposition instead of
facts.

  As a member of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, you
participated in about half a dozen antitrust cases. To be frank,
those decisions have not given me a very clear idea of which view
you take of the antitrust laws. On the one hand, your dissent in
Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press v. Thornburgh im-
pressed me greatly with your high regard for consumers and for
fair competition.

  In that case, the Attorney General overrode the recommendation
of his Antitrust Division and permitted the merger of two finan-
cially viable newspapers in Detroit. You were admirably the only
judge who looked at the facts and questioned whether the Attorney
General's decision would open the door to a self-serving competition
quieting arrangement between local newspapers in Detroit and
other markets.

  On the other hand, you joined the court's opinion in Rothery
Storage & Van Company v. Atlas Van Lines. Now, that decision
has been criticized by commentators for taking an economic view
of the antitrust laws which favors big business over smaller com-
petitors and consumers.

  Because the Supreme Court appears to be of two minds about
the antitrust cases, I frankly believe the next Justice will have an
important influence on the direction the Court takes. As I stated,
your antitrust decisions don't give me a clear idea of how you will
come out on those cases.

  Please share with us your views as to whether a defendant can
excuse anticompetitive conduct that violates the antitrust laws on
the basis of an economic theory of business efficiency.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Metzenbaum, I think your recitation of
the purposes of the antitrust law--to protect consumers, to protect
the independent decisionmaking of entrepreneurs--is entirely cor-
rect. I am pleased that you like my opinion in the Michigan Citi-
zens (1989) case. It is a decision that I wrote. I think it gives the
best picture of my views in this area.

  As for Rothery Storage (1986), that is an opinion I joined but did
not write. It seemed a rather clear case of an arrangement involv-
ing a small firm in an industry that had many firms and no entry
barriers, plus the particular arrangement was to the advantage of
consumers.

  No one doubted that. There was no dissenting opinion in Rothery.
Four judges considered that case, and all four of them came to the
same conclusion. So I think your concern is not with the decision
or the judgment reached, but with portions of the court's opinion.

          75-974 0 - 9 4 -- 6
                                      152
  You know how we work in courts of appeals. Rothery was decided
in the first instance by District Judge Oberdorfer. He wrote a good
opinion. We could have rested on that opinion. But the case was
fully briefed and argued in our court before a panel of three judges.
We voted unanimously to affirm. The opinion was then assigned to
one of the three of us. Such an opinion, when completed, is cir-
culated to the panel and panel members respond. We all agreed
with most of the opinion.
  The major difference centered largely on a footnote. I don't think
that the judgment reached in Rothery is one that many would criti-
cize. Facets of the opinion may have been open to criticism. When
one of my colleagues is assigned the opinion, I will read the cir-
culated opinion carefully. If anything stands out as genuinely trou-
blesome, I will alert the writer of the opinion. Perhaps the footnote
could have been revised or eliminated as a collegial accommoda-
tion. But the Rothery judgment itself seems to me noncontroversial.
As I said, the case was not a difficult case.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me switch to still another subject.
Thank you for your response.
  As Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, I have tried to
be a strong advocate for America's workers. I reviewed your court
of appeals opinions in labor law cases, and I would like to ask you
about two of those decisions: Conair v. NLRB and St. Francis v.
NLRB.
  In both cases, workers were trying to organize to improve their
wages and working conditions. Federal law protects their right to
do that. You know that. I know that. Most people in this country
know that. But when they tried to organize, the employers re-
sponded by threatening to close the plant, by coercively interrogat-
ing and threatening employees, and by firing union sympathizers.
  It was no surprise that the employers' unlawful tactics worked.
The employees were very intimidated, and the unions lost both
elections.
  You agreed in these cases that the employers had engaged in "se-
rious," "outrageous," "massive and unrelenting antiunion conduct"
that interfered with the workers' freedom to organize. Neverthe-
less, although the NLRB has broad discretion to grant effective
remedies, you voted in both cases to reject the Board's order, re-
quiring the employer to bargain with the union. In short, you
agreed that the employers had violated the law in a pervasive fash-
ion, but you voted to overturn the remedy that the NLRB thought
was appropriate.
  I am not interested in going over the facts of either of these cases
or even the legal basis for your decisions. I don't see any useful
purpose in that. But in reading your opinions, I can't discern
whether you can identify with the harsh practical realities of the
workplace when antiunion employers intimidate their employees to
prevent them from organizing. I can't tell from your decision
whether you understand what it is to have your boss threaten your
livelihood and your family's economic well-being, to watch your
friends lose their jobs, to sit in the boss' office while he interrogates
you about your union sympathies, all because you and your cowork-
ers are trying to band together to improve your wages and working
conditions.

  Supreme Court Justices, as you and I both know, are far re-
moved from these harsh realities. If they don't come to the job with
a deep understanding of the problems of America's workers, they
will never achieve that understanding.
  I wonder if you could shed some light on your insight into the
problem of workers trying to organize in the face of an antagonistic
employer and whether there is anything in your background that
gives you some feeling of understanding of the challenge that the
worker has.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Metzenbaum, I don't think one needs
to delve into my psyche on that score. I think if you take a full and
fair look at the body of decisions I have written in the labor law
area, you will be well satisfied that I possess the empathy you have
just expressed. I might mention the Fort Bragg (1989) case, among
many.
  In St. Francis (1984), I did not say the Board lacked power to
issue a bargaining order in that setting. Far from it. I said give us
a reason.
  One of the things we must be careful about regarding adminis-
trative agencies is any tendency for them to abuse their authority.
One of the easiest ways to be abusive is to decide turbulent ques-
tions without giving a reason.
  It seemed to me that on the facts presented in St. Francis, the
Board had not justified imposing a bargaining order. St. Francis,
unlike Conair (1983), was not a case of egregious conduct. Unfair
labor practice, yes, but not the kind of pattern that was involved
in Conair. And so I did not say that a bargaining order would be
inappropriate in that situation. All I said was, Board, you haven't
given us a reason why you ordered bargaining in this case and not
in other similar cases. All I asked of the NLRB was this: Say why
you ruled as you did. It seemed to me unsatisfactory to have an
order out there without adequately supportive reasoning.
  Conair was a different case. Conair was the worst kind of con-
duct imaginable on the part of an employer. But I was dealing with
a statute, the NLRA, that protects the rights of employees. And
that was a situation where the employees themselves had never in
any way indicated that they wanted a union.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Isn't that the case where 45 percent of the
employees had signed cards?
  Judge GlNSBURG. There was never at any point a showing of a
card majority.
  Senator METZENBAUM. That is correct.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And what I said was this: The principle of ma-
jority rule is fundamental to the legislation, the NLRA. It seemed
to me that if Congress wanted to give the Board the authority to
issue a bargaining order, even when there was never proof that at
any time a majority of the workers wanted a union, the majority
rule principle would have to be abandoned. If Congress wants the
Board to have that authority, Congress should say so. I thought it
involved a basic policy decision that the legislature should make.
  Now, it has been many years, you know, since the Conair deci-
sion, and in all that time the legislation has remained unaltered.
But
                                      154
  Senator METZENBAUM. Because the law already permits--the
NLRB has the right to recognize, order an employer to recognize
a union where less than a majority of employees have signed cards
and have not voted in an election if the employer's conduct is of
such a nature that it has been so intimidating and so harassing
and so restrictive of the employee's rights. The NLRB has that
right now.
  Judge GINSBURG. There was a very strong dissent in Conair to
that effect, whether you needed to have a showing of a majority at
any time.
  Strong arguments can be made either way, Senator. I am simply
saying that there is written into that Act, the NLRA, the principle
that underlies so much of our society, and that is the principle of
majority rule. The NLRA says it is the employees' choice.
  There was another factor in Conair, as you know. Because of the
way, unfortunately, the process moves, by the time that case came
to our court there had been--by the time it got to the Board for
decision, no less the court, by that time, there had been a total
turnover of employees. So none of the people who were in that shop
at the time the Board decided the case had been exposed to the em-
ployer's egregious practices. If the Board had succeeded in impos-
ing a bargaining order at that point, the NLRB would have im-
posed the order on a whole new set of employees. So that was a
factor, too.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I have long been an advocate for placing
what Thomas Jefferson described as a wall of separation between
church and state. I applaud Justice Hugo Black's statement in the
1947 case of Everson v. Board of Education that the first amend-
ment has erected a wall between church and state that must be
high and impregnable.
  As you know, in the 1971 case of Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Court
devised a three-part test which applies strict scrutiny to any law
that has a religious purpose. To pass muster, a law must not per-
tain specifically to religion, must not advance nor inhibit religion,
and must not excessively entangle government with religion. It is
a strict test, as I believe it should be. It has been used to strike
down such things as State tax relief programs that benefited paro-
chial schools.
  However, some of the Justices currently sitting on the Court are
in favor of toppling this wall between church and state. This term,
Justices Scalia and Thomas ridiculed the Lemon test. In their dis-
sent in Lamb's Chapel v. CenterMauritius School District, the Jus-
tices compared it to "some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that
repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad after being re-
peatedly killed and buried."
  Both Justices suggested that pencils should be "driven through
the creature's heart" and that is should be buried "fully six feet
under."
  In my opinion, if the Lemon test were to meet the fate Justices
Scalia and Thomas have in mind, it could put the Government in
the business of choosing which religious groups receive taxpayer
dollars. It could even destroy the religious harmony on which our
country prides itself.
                                      155
  I don't believe that you have written an opinion that speaks di-
rectly to this issue. At least we did not come across it. Would you
care to give us your view of the Lemon test and whether you agree
with Justice Black that the Court should keep a high and impreg-
nable wall between church and state?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Metzenbaum, you are right that I don't
have any cases in the establishment area except a couple of stand-
ing cases. I do have a few in the free-exercise area. This issue, as
you know, will come before the Court in many cases in the future,
as it has in the past. My approach or attitude about criticism, the
kind that you read, is generally to ask: "What is the alternative?"
It is easy to tear down, to deconstruct. It is not so easy to con-
struct. Some of my law school and judicial colleagues don't appre-
ciate that sufficiently. It is much easier to criticize than to come
up with an alternative.
  So, as a general matter, I would never tear down unless I am
sure I have a better building to replace what is being torn down.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much, Judge Ginsburg.
My time has expired.
  Senator LEAHY [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Metzenbaum.
  The last questioning this evening will be Senator Simpson's. Sen-
ator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, that was a ghoulish case that
our colleague from Ohio reported on. I was fascinated by that lan-
guage. Who did that? I will ask him, but I see he is preoccupied.
It was certainly graphic.
  Senator SIMON. It was Justice Scalia.
  Senator SIMPSON. What was that ghoulish case you were quoting
from there, Senator Metzenbaum, that ghoulish case about stakes
in the hearts and the specters of the night and six feet into the
hole?
  Senator METZENBAUM. It is Lamb's Chapel v. Center Mauritius
School District.
  Senator LEAHY. I think the question of the Senator from Wyo-
ming was who was the judge writing the opinion.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I don't know who wrote the prevail-
ing opinion, but the two who wrote the language that I read were
Scalia and Thomas. You remember them.
  Senator SIMPSON. I remember them. [Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. I didn't want the record to be incomplete, Alan.
  Senator SIMPSON. I wondered when he was going to insert that
in the record.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I thought I had said it at the time.
  Senator SIMPSON. I perhaps missed that. But, nevertheless, it is
always the spirited thing to follow Senator Metzenbaum, and I
have been doing that for 14 years. You can imagine the burden
that I have to carry, because he usually lays all the traps and he
knows I am going to jump right in them. And I often have, and
probably will again.
  Nevertheless, upon his retirement--and he announced that--I
went to the floor very swiftly, and I said as far as Senator Metzen-
baum--and I spoke glowingly about him, and I said, "But I don't
want this to sound like a eulogy, although there have been many
times when I wished it was." [Laughter.]
                                      156
  And so we shall miss him and his incisive participation, but he
has lots more, many more months to go to serve on this committee.
I enjoy him very much.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Alan.
  Senator SIMPSON. Many questions have been asked. It can get te-
dious. You are all great sports at this hour, and if we go a little
further tonight, you will have less to do tomorrow. And I think you
would appreciate that. But you are very patient and very adroit in
your responses.
  Let me ask one. It came to me as I looked at a large bulk of ma-
terial that our ranking member, Senator Hatch, provided us. That
was a significant number of recusals. Where you recused yourself,
it was quite a bulky stack. You have been recused from hearing
cases more than 250 times, by count of someone on my staff, dur-
ing your years on the circuit court, and that obviously is no prob-
lem and would not be a problem on the circuit court since another
judge could take your place on the panel. But it seems that it could
be a problem on the nine-member Supreme Court.
  Will it be a problem? What do you foresee there? And I realize
that is totally nebulous. Assuming your confirmation, what--I
sense you will be very careful about doing that whenever you feel
any sense of the conflict. In looking at some of those recusals, they
were very precise, very specific; in fact, backed up carefully with
documentation, letters. It was impressive, and I am not even sug-
gesting anything that would be awry. But what do you think could
happen with regard to recusals?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The number that you recited, in fact, startled
me. I was not aware that
  Senator SIMPSON. Over the years.
  Judge GlNSBURG [continuing]. That there was any such number.
I did recite, in response to the questionnaire, what my recusal pol-
icy is.
  Senator SIMPSON. It is very clear and certainly very appropriate.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And the specific instances, which were not too
many, in which I determined to recuse myself sua sponte, those
are, I think, just 11, 11 in 13 years.
  Senator SIMPSON. Eleven?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes. There are automatic recusals in my court
for every judge, and that is worked out in the clerk's office. Each
judge has a recusal list of clients, of parties whose cases that judge
will not sit on because of a financial interest--in my case, it is
never because of stock ownership, because when I got this good job
we sold all our securities. Some of the judges will list one company
or another, and they won't sit on those cases because they or their
spouse or a minor child owns securities. That is never a cause of
a conflict for me. Rather, my recusals generally occur when a law-
yer in my family has a client relationship with a party. But I would
have to see what is the basis for that number.
   Senator SIMPSON. I am sure that what you say is so, and in most
cases the clerk would automatically recuse you from her list of the
parties that you had left, and I have a hunch that your list was
very complete.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think, Senator, now that you jog my memory,
my very first year on the court, I may have had an unusual num-
                                      157
ber of recusals in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cases. I
think so for this reason: My son was given at birth a share of El
Paso Natural Gas, which, due to a stock split, became two shares.

  When I was appointed by President Carter, we sold all of our
shares, but we couldn't find my son's share of El Paso Natural Gas.
It got lost in transit. A Federal statute says, if you have a financial
interest, if you, your spouse, or a minor child living in your house-
hold has a financial interest in a party, a financial interest "how-
ever small"--those are the words Congress put into the statute--
you must recuse yourself.

  After turning over every paper we had, I finally found the El
Paso share certificate, gave it to my spouse who was going to New
York, and asked him to bring it to our bank and have the bank sell
it. Well, he lost it en route. [Laughter.]

  Then we had to
  Senator SIMPSON. It probably pleased the broker.
  Judge GINSBURG. It took the better part of a year to get and sell
a replacement certificate. It meant that for one entire term of the
court, I was recused from all El Paso cases, not because of my hus-
band's law practice, but simply because my son was given at birth
one share then worth $10 of El Paso Natural Gas. That experience,
and others like it, might lead Congress to rethink whether the stat-
ute really should say "financial interest, however small." There
should perhaps be a de minimis principle installed.
  Senator LEAHY. If the Senator from Wyoming would yield, I am
advised by the staff that during Judge Ginsburg's tenure on the
circuit court of appeals, she was automatically recused 108 times,
plus the 11 that you did. There is some confusion in the numbers.
  I also tend to agree that we should probably have a different rule
and put de minimis activities, because it gets a little crazy.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think that is true and I concur. Obviously,
some of those were the telephone companies, and I am sure your
husband's firm. I am just leading it, and surely I was thinking of
the broker waiting to do that transaction. You would be known as
the greatest odd-lot trader of our time, one share of El Paso.
[Laughter.]
  Do you think that would be any problem in your duties on the
U.S. Supreme Court?
  Judge GINSBURG. NO, Senator, I don't think so. I don't think I
have the highest recusal rate on my court. On automatic recusals,
I probably come out, taking 13 years into account, somewhere in
the middle, I would guess.
  The telephone company recusals didn't come in time to allow me
to escape from the huge access charge case. I did sit on that. It was
a complex case, with an opinion divided three ways among the pan-
elists.
  Senator SIMPSON. I thank you. Let me ask you a question about
a case. In 1989, you were on a penal deciding DKT Memorial Fund
v. Agency for International Development, AID. A foreign organiza-
tion claimed that its speech abroad was unconstitutionally re-
stricted by conditions the U.S. Government attached to providing
financial assistance.
  And while you did not reach that issue, you expressed sympathy
for the argument in that sense, and so do I. Senator Simon and I
                                      158

had an amendment to overturn that. Senator Bingaman and I are
involved in population control at international levels. So the next
question then comes back to thoughts on whether foreigners abroad
have the protection of the U.S. Constitution from U.S. govern-
mental action.

  There I become triggered by activities in immigration and refu-
gee activities. If you believe that the Constitution would apply at
all to foreigners abroad, what are the limits to its protection?

  I think it is my personal thought that an extension of constitu-
tional right abroad, again, other than this issue of abortion rights
or family planning or what was attempted to have been done, it
would certainly have a severe effect on U.S. immigration and refu-
gee policy. Considerable immigration activities take place in our
embassies, our refugee camps, at the U.S. border, across the U.S.
border, all outside of U.S. territory. Are aliens detained at the U.S.
border entitled to the full panoply of constitutional rights that citi-
zens enjoy?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, the case law, as you know, has devel-
oped since that DKT (1987) decision. I think the Supreme Court
has answered the question you raised. No, the Court said, the Con-
stitution doesn't necessarily follow the flag abroad. As you correctly
stated, that was a thought I expressed, but my decision did not rest
on the notion that the foreign population planning group in ques-
tion was entitled to U.S. constitutional rights. It was a population
planning group in India. My dissent rested on the free speech
rights of the U.S. organization.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU have always been very interested and ac-
tive in population planning and that type of thing, haven't you, in
your general work, issues of--of course, we know so well your work
in women's rights and your significant incremental approach,
which worked and worked so well. But the issue of international
population planning and that type of thing is something that is ap-
propriate.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Our Government has long been involved in
that area. The policy that was at issue in the DKT case has since
been changed. It was the Mexico City policy, a policy withdrawn by
President Clinton in the first week of this administration.

  Senator SIMPSON. Very appropriately, I thought. It was a tough
one for me to watch during the administration of my own party.

  As you say so clearly, you did not reach that issue, but you ex-
pressed concern and sympathy for the argument, and it is going to
be a much more serious case as it comes up, as people pay more
attention to refugee asylum and immigration issues.

  Many of them don't understand that overseas, when someone is
seeking asylum, a member of the Embassy consular staff makes
the decision as to whether they receive this precious status of refu-
gee or not, with no appeal possible under any circumstances what-
soever, and that is it. And when they get here, we have a list of
items of due process that are often more than a U.S. citizen re-
ceives, an interesting irony, part of the cause of the movement in
the world today here. Enough of that.

  Under the ninth amendment, rights left unnamed in the Con-
stitution are retained by the people. When considering that des-
ignation of the right retained by the people, how would you reason
                                      159
the grant or denial of a new right not enumerated in the Constitu-
tion? You have touched on this.

  I frankly like the way you kind of prod Congress along. It is a
very important aspect of what a court should do, in my mind. Even
though I believe deeply in separation of powers, there comes a time
when I think a court has to say why don't you people go back to
work, instead of putting me through this grueling exercise, and do
what you are supposed to do, and that is correct this or legislate
it. That is my view. But to what extent would the position, the ac-
tion or nonaction of the Congress be a factor in your reasoning?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Simpson, the primary guardian of the
9th and 10th amendments has really got to be the Congress itself.
The national government is one of enumerated powers. To create
a conflict, an arguable conflict with the 10th amendment, Congress
would have to take action vis-a-vis the States.

  So I think these amendments, first about not restricting people's
rights and then about the reserved rights of the States, these
amendments are peculiarly directed to Congress. A question about
the 10th amendment would never come to Court apart from some
action Congress has taken.

  So I think these two amendments are instructions first and fore-
most to Congress itself. Congress is not to limit people's freedom
and not to encroach upon the States. And it is only when Congress
takes an action with regard to the States that the States consider
intrusive, that a 10th amendment issue would come to the Court.
So I think that these amendments are directed to the Congress. I
think you suggested that in the way you put the question.

  Senator SIMPSON. Justice Brennan, we used to visit about things.
You can still do that I think in this separation of powers. He would
often say I think it's time for you people to move. That is what he
would say. And he was usually very right. I think that is a very
important thing. We say it is a government of laws and not men
and women, but I think it is more really a government of men and
women, and not laws, and he was one who perceived that, that it
was about persons. I think you perceive that, from all the readings
I have looked at that you have done, the readings of your writings.

  I think that is a heartening prospect, if I could enjoy seeing an
opinion come down which might be just one line and say how did
this get here, why didn't you do this? Was it because you were po-
litically in chains and restricted and politically correct, where you
couldn't move? This issue cries out for your attention, so have a go
at it before you bring it back here.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Simpson, I have ended a number of
opinions with the lines, "We need guidance from Higher Authority."

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU didn't mean us? [Laughter.]
  Judge GlNSBURG. I surely did, when we are dealing with stat-
utes. We do have now a means of communication just starting.
Brookings is aiding in this effort. There has been cooperation both
on the judiciary side and on the part of Congress. Opinions of my
circuit not infrequently identify statutes with gaps or obscure lan-
guage. Very often, these are not political hot potatoes, but just
something unforeseen, the particular case wasn't seen. We send
those opinions, with no comment at all, to the Senate, and I think
                                      160
the House, as well, for Congress to do what it will to clear up the
laws.

  Other circuits are doing this, and perhaps we will succeed in re-
ducing some of the uncertainty in the law, if when courts spot a
need for revision, clarifying revision, Congress will then respond.
That kind of cooperation is just beginning and I hope it will bear
fruit.

  Senator SIMPSON. I hope so, too, and I think those are good
things, and perhaps seminars and perhaps discussions of court
members. We ought to do that through the Brookings Institution,
where legislators and Supreme Court Justices sat down and talked
informally, and those are good things, I think very good things.

  Let me ask you another one, because it is certainly going to come
up I think more and more, not just with television, violence, the
arts. There has been considerable controversy in recent years over
the use of Federal taxpayer money to fund art, which some find of-
fensive. Some argue, of course, that the denial of funding of some
of those art forms is equal to nothing more than censorship. Others
argue that the art is sacrilegious or morally offensive and
undeserving of public financial support.

  The first amendment prohibits the Government from restricting
expression on the basis of its content, and the courts have not
made public funding or the denial of it the equivalent yet of pun-
ishing expression, and the courts have not required the Govern-
ment to fund all types of art expression, and the Government is
free to favor particular types of expressions over others.

  What is the reasoning you might use in considering a case in-
volving a constitutional right to Federal funding of the arts or
something else that might be highly controversial of similar na-
ture?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Simpson, the initial concern of the first
amendment is with the Government as censor. I don't think the
first amendment says that the Government can't choose Shake-
speare over modern theater, David Mamet, for example, in deciding
what programs it wants to support, say, for public performances.
It can't shut down speech, but it can purchase according to its pref-
erence, within limits.

  So although the first amendment keeps the Government from
squelching speech on the basis of its content, I don't think anyone
has taken the first amendment or the equal protection principle to
the length of saying Government must fund equally anything that
anyone considers art. I think the Government as a consumer
doesn't have to buy all art equally.

  Senator SIMPSON. It is my experience that the toughest part of
the job from this side of the table is dealing with the extremists
on both sides of every issue. That is what we get to deal with here,
the locked-in of the world who are not going to change their opin-
ion, the ones who can make their opinion in the shortest possible
time with the most possible emotion and the least possible content.
So we deal with that continually.

  Yet, those are the things that cause people great concern about
their Government works, whether the courts work, and meanwhile
the poor citizen who is in the middle, the thoughtful person, as I
say, raising their children, going to work, coaching, teaching, in-
                                      161

volving themselves in the community--they are sitting it out, and
meanwhile the heavy hits and the shrieking come from both sides
on both extremes, and I find that so often.

  Those things, then, when they get that hot are often sidestepped
by us and then they come to the judiciary. I think there will be
more of that, and then they will accuse you of being an activist
Court, which is the way that works. Yet, if we were more active
in dealing with it before it came to the fueling of emotion and rac-
ism and guilt and anguish and all the rest of it, it might be a bet-
ter filter for you. But that is rambling, as best described.

  In a speech on March 9 of this year, questioning the rationale of
Roe--and it is interesting to me how I keep reading that appar-
ently you didn't do this correctly for some with regard to Roe v.
Wade. I am pro-choice, always have been, never varied, after the
State of Wyoming had to change its law because the law over-
turned by Roe v. Wade was exactly the same as that on the books
in the State of Wyoming. I was a member of the Wyoming Legisla-
ture at the time. We did it, and it was a tough and emotional de-
bate greater than any I have been in in this arena.

  You remarked, "But without taking giant strides and thereby
risking a backlash too forceful to contain, the Court, through con-
stitutional adjudication, can reinforce or signal a green light for a
social change." I would ask you. Judge Ginsburg, in your view, are
the limits on the Court's ability to act as an engine for social
change merely prudential and self-imposed according to the will of
each Justice, or are there instead more fundamental, perhaps even
constitutional, limits to the Court's authority?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, if there is any message I would like
the public to understand about courts, it is that courts don't make
controversies; courts don't choose what they do. Courts are con-
strained, as you know, Federal courts, by article III. Article III tells
Congress what it may give the Federal courts to do, and Congress
is limited in this way, too. Congress can't put on our plate some-
thing that isn't included in one of the article III categories.

  So the courts are limited, first, by the case or controversy re-
quirement. A case of a judiciary nature has to be a live controversy
between adverse parties. Federal courts are limited in the subject
matter of the cases they may hear, and there are a host of require-
ments that people must meet in order to have a justiciable case or
controversy. Those stem from the Constitution first, then from the
laws that Congress passes in conferring or withholding jurisdiction
from the Federal courts, and then from precedent built up since the
Nation was new.

  So no judge can decide what is appropriate for a court to do. All
of what judges do is heavily constrained by the Constitution, the
laws, the decisions, and the traditions that have been built up over
200 years.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, Judge Ginsburg, my time has expired,
but I would just reflect that whatever you have been doing has
worked pretty well, so keep doing it. That is my thought for today.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Senator LEAHY. Judge, you and your family have been extremely
patient. I might say for myself this has been one of the most inter-
esting and enlightening days I have spent in my 19 years here in
                                      162
the Senate. I have enjoyed every moment of it, but it is time to let
you and your family and your friends have some rest.

  We will stand in recess until 10 tomorrow morning. Thank you.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  [Whereupon, at 7:29 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re-
convene at 10 a.m., Wednesday, July 21, 1993.]
NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 21, 1993

                                                                   U.S. SENATE,
                                              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:12 a.m., in room
216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Simpson,
Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen, and Pressler.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. Welcome back,
Judge.
  Let me say to my colleagues on the committee that after having
a brief discussion with the judge this morning and discussing how
we will proceed, it is my hope and expectation that every Senator
will have an opportunity to ask their first round before today is
over.
  Unless someone on the committee objects, I would like to proceed
in the following manner: Starting with the distinguished Senator
from Arizona, we will ask three rounds of questions, three Sen-
ators; we will break, then come back, and do three more and break,
and continue along that way.
  Although the judge is very accustomed, as a judge, to being seat-
ed and listening to argumentation for lengthy periods of time, I
think it is a different circumstance when you are having to do the
talking instead of the listening. And although she is prepared to sit
as long as we want, I think we should not keep her in that seat
without stretching her legs for more than an hour-and-a-half at a
shot, if that is all right with you, Judge.
  Judge GINSBURG. That is just fine. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO that is what we will do. With that, let me see.
If we go--well, we will figure it out. I will confer with my colleague
here as to when we will break for lunch. After the end of this round
with Senator DeConcini, I will announce that.
  Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
  Judge Ginsburg, thank you for the thoughtfulness that you have
put forth in yesterday's hearing. Though I wasn't here for all of it,
I did watch a lot of it, and I appreciate your effort to satisfy this
committee. As you have noticed, the diversity here is widespread,

                                                         (163)
                                      164

and it isn't easy to listen to all of us expound on judicial matters,
particularly when you are an expert on it and we pretend to be.
Some are, but I pretend to be.

  I do have some questions, however, that have, oh, I wouldn't say
troubled me, but which deal with areas that I think are important
enough to elicit a response from a nominee, and I have asked them
of many nominees before. They deal with an area that you truly
are an expert in, and that is the equal protection clause of the 14th
amendment, and particularly as it relates to gender.

  Judge Ginsburg, throughout the 1980's I have asked Reagan and
Bush Supreme Court nominees their views on gender discrimina-
tion. It was my belief that because of the integral role that the
equal protection clause has performed in advancing women's equal-
ity, a Supreme Court nominee must be committed to those prin-
ciples. I had concerns that the standards of review developed in the
1970's for gender discrimination analysis under the equal protec-
tion clause were at risk at times by nominees that were here. How-
ever, you, more than anyone else, any other individual I know,
guided the Court into the direction of applying greater scrutiny to
laws that discriminate on the basis of gender.

  Yesterday I was quite moved by your exchange with Senator
Kennedy when you shared the details of the cases that you liti-
gated and some of your personal experience. Having, myself, had
two daughters and even a mother who was discriminated against
a long time ago, almost 70 years--and she raised me reminding of
that--it is on my mind. And your discussion demonstrated to me,
and I think the public, how abstract principles of constitutional law
affect everyday people in the most fundamental way, including the
basic rights to sit on the jury, administer the estate of a deceased
family member, or to claim survivor's benefits for a deceased
spouse.

  Now, the heightened scrutiny test has made an enormous dif-
ference in combating laws that discriminate against women in our
society. Earlier in this effort to change the law, you argued to the
Court that gender-discriminatory statutes should receive the high-
est level of scrutiny. But then you revised your strategy, I believe,
and steered the Court toward the middle-level scrutiny. And in a
speech you gave in 1987, you praised the intermediate-scrutiny ap-
proach as a stable middle ground; that is, "an effective blend be-
tween responding to social change and actually driving it."

  So my question, Judge, to you is: Will an intermediate level of
scrutiny for gender discrimination statutes always be satisfactory,
or does the area need to be constantly developed further?

              TESTIMONY OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator DeConcini, I don't recall the words
that you read. It was always my view that distinctions on the basis
of gender should be treated most skeptically because, historically,
virtually every classification that, in fact, limited women's opportu-
nities was regarded as one cast benignly in her favor.
  I tried yesterday to trace the difference between racial classifica-
tions, Jim Crow laws--which were not obscure in the message that
one race was regarded as inferior to the other--and gender classi-
fications that were always rationalized as favors to women. My
                                      165
constant position was that these classifications must be rethought.
Are they genuinely favorable, or are they indications of
stereotypical thinking about the way women or men are. And
that

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, Judge, to be a bit more specific, are
you saying that you have to look at each case in determining
whether or not the strict scrutiny or the intermediate scrutiny is
applied? Is it on that basis or--first of all, am I correct that gen-
erally you believe that the intermediate scrutiny, as the Court has,
I think, clearly established, is the right area for gender discrimina-
tion cases? You don't commit yourself to always be there? Is that
what I think your position is, or can you expound on what your po-
sition is, please?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator DeConcini, as an advocate, I urged the
highest level of scrutiny and

  Senator DECONCINI. All the time?
  Judge GINSBURG. After it became clear as a strategic matter that
there was not a fifth vote soon to declare sex a "suspect" category,
I tried to establish a middle tier. In fact, I did that even earlier--
the Frontiero (1973) Brief was the first time. Briefs I presented
gave the Court two choices in Reed (1971), three in Frontiero and
in Capt. Susan Struck's case.
  As you know, I was an advocate of the equal rights amendment.
I still am.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO am I.
  Judge GINSBURG. SO I think that answers your question about
the level of scrutiny that
  Senator DECONCINI. But absent that amendment, Judge, then
your position is that the strict scrutiny should be the beginning
point on any gender issue brought before the Court?
  Judge GINSBURG. I will try to answer your question this way.
The last time the Supreme Court addressed this question, as I
mentioned yesterday, was in the Mississippi University for Women
(1982) case. The Court struck down a gender-based classification
and said in a footnote that the question whether sex should be re-
garded as a suspect classification was one not necessary to decide
that day; we don't have to go that far, the Court explained, to re-
solve the case at hand. It thus remains an open question before the
Supreme Court.
   Senator DECONCINI. And before you?
  Judge GINSBURG. I can't, sitting where I am now
  Senator DECONCINI. I understand.
  Judge GINSBURG [continuing]. Say anything more than what is
in my briefs and my articles and my advocacy of the equal rights
amendment, which is part of the record before you.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, thank you, Judge, and I will supply
you the reference material I used here in your speech of 1987
where you praised the intermediate-scrutiny approach as a stable
middle ground. And if you care to or can give any clarification--
maybe that is taken out of context, and I have not read the entire
remarks that you made, which might be unfair. But if you can give
me a little more explanation, I would appreciate that. It doesn't
have to be right now.
                                      166
  Judge GINSBURG. I would be glad to respond regarding that par-
ticular piece. At the moment, I don't recognize the words as mine.
  Senator DECONCINI. And I appreciate that.
  Yesterday, Judge Ginsburg, in reflecting to Senator Kennedy on
a number of personal encounters that you had relating what
brought you to where you began to press these issues in a legal
forum, you had stories behind the reasons on how it affected you.
One of the stories that I would like to know is the reason why you
refer to this area as "gender discrimination" instead of "sex dis-
crimination." Is there a history to that?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, there is. I hesitate every time I say "gen-
der-based discrimination" because I have been strongly criticized by
an academic colleague for whom I have the highest respect. He
tells me, "That term belongs in the grammar books; the word for
what you have in mind is 'sex' and why don't you use it?" And I
will tell you why I don't use it.
  In the 1970's, when I was at Columbia and writing briefs, arti-
cles, and speeches about distinctions based on sex, I had a bright
secretary. She said one day, "I have been typing this word, sex, sex,
sex, over and over. Let me tell you, the audience you are address-
ing, the men you are addressing"--and they were all men in the
appellate courts in those days--"the first association of that word
is not what you are talking about. So I suggest that you use a
grammar-book term. Use the word 'gender.' It will ward off dis-
tracting associations."
  Senator DECONCINI. That secretary obviously was a woman.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. And, Millicent, if you are somewhere
watching this, I owe it all to you. [Laughter.]
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, it shows that good advice can come
from staff people, as we all know working here.
  Judge, with regards to the issue of standard of review for gender
discrimination laws, you once wrote that a society changed and
evolved with respect to the role of men and women; so, too, did the
force of the grandly general clause of the Constitution that provides
for equal protection of the law.
  Now, the Constitution has open-ended and broad clauses such as
the one we are discussing, the equal protection clause. And as you
have stated, as society changes, so do the meaning of those clauses.
  Now, as Senator Feinstein noted in her opening statement yes-
terday, in the first 100 years of the equal protection clause of the
14th amendment, not a single gender-based challenge was sus-
tained. And as you mentioned yesterday, even the Warren Court,
which has been criticized for their activism, upheld restrictions on
jury service for women.
  So as our society changes and evolves, so do our interpretations
of these open-ended clauses. Indeed, you have also written that our
18th century Constitution is dependent on changes in societal prac-
tices, constitutional amendments, and judicial interpretation.
  Now, were the gender discrimination cases that you brought in
the 1970's reflecting social changes, or were they leading social
changes, from your viewpoint?
  Judge GINSBURG. From my viewpoint, they were reflecting social
changes and putting the imprimatur of the law on the direction of
change that was ongoing in society. Yesterday I described the Hoyt
                                      167
(1961) case, Gwendolyn Hoyt's case, the case of the woman who, in
an altercation with her husband, hit him over the head with a bro-
ken baseball bat, her son's broken baseball bat, and as a result,
ended up being prosecuted and convicted of second-degree murder.
When I mentioned that 1961 Supreme Court decision, I said there
was no possibility of winning that case at the time it arose. No one
would listen to the argument that this exemption from jury service
wasn't pure favor to women.

  One of you mentioned yesterday--I think it was Senator Ken-
nedy--the case of Goesaert v. Cleary (1948). That was about a
mother and daughter who owned and operated a bar in the State
of Michigan. The mother owned the bar. The mother and the
daughter wanted to tend the bar that they themselves owned. But
Michigan law, as was said yesterday, declared that a woman could
not tend bar unless she was the wife or the daughter of a male
barowner.

  That mother and daughter found that Michigan's law effectively
put them out of business. The rationale for the law was that bar-
tending wasn't safe; rather, it was a risky occupation. So women
were being protected. They were being sheltered from working in
such a setting, absent a father figure, or a husband, as the owner.

  In my law school constitutional law casebook, I remember the
Goesaert case being treated simply as an illustration of the Su-
preme Court's retreat from the Lochner (1905) era, in which the
Court regularly struck down economic and social legislation. Hard-
ly a word was said about the mother and daughter, the people
Michigan's law put out of business. That was 1948. The case was
regarded as a typical example of the Court's retreat from a body
of decisions that interfered with legislative judgments about eco-
nomic and social legislation.

  So there really was no chance that any court in the land, and
certainly not the Supreme Court, was going to move until there
were pervasive changes in society. Change in the mid-1900's per-
haps started during World War II, when women took jobs that had
been considered, up until then, jobs only men could do. You remem-
ber Rosie the Riveter. There was a time after the war when women
were told to go back home, don't compete with men for jobs. But
then many things came together. One factor was inflation. The
two-earner family became a pattern people accepted out of neces-
sity, out of caring for--wanting to provide the best for--their chil-
dren. Factors that coalesced included women's opportunity to con-
trol their reproductive capacity, the two-earner family pattern,
longer life spans, the woman having a life at home and at work.

  A number of factors came together to change women's lives, to
alter and expand what they were doing.

  Senator DECONCINI. Societal changes you are referring to, pri-
marily.

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, let me pursue it just by asking you,
Judge, when you are confirmed and you sit on the Supreme Court,
when and how do you determine whether to lead or follow societal
changes?
  Judge GlNSBURG. That sounds like a question Mr. Chairman
asked me yesterday.
                                      168
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, he was kind of asking that question.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am glad you remember, Judge.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And I would like to ask all of your indulgence
to help me with this, because I must deal with the question in
terms of past history. I can't predict in terms of cases that might
come up.
  Senator DECONCINI. I don't want you to do that, and I under-
stand the sensitivity of that question. But I am interested in just
how you approach it. I mean, it isn't some kind of a score I am
keeping here, yes or no, that you fail or flunk.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I will give you the answers I attempted to give
in the Madison lecture, a lecture I was afraid would put the audi-
ence to sleep, but has turned out to prompt a quite different re-
sponse. [Laughter.]
  I gave in that lecture two examples. One was Baker v. Carr
(1962). That was a State legislative reapportionment case. I quoted
from a law professor who said the rationale for that decision and
the ones that followed it, the one-person, one-vote line of decisions,
was that when political avenues become dead-end streets judicial
intervention in the politics of the people may be essential in order
to have effective politics. Baker v. Carr came up from Tennessee,
I believe. The comment concerned the composition of Tennessee's
legislature at the time of Baker. At that time there was a history
of many years of unsuccessful State court litigation and unsuccess-
ful efforts to get the State legislature to reapportion itself. So that
is one example.
  When is the political avenue a dead-end street? The other exam-
ple, the historic example, of course, is race discrimination, which
we talked about yesterday. It was not simply the schools. I referred
to a talk that Judge Constance Baker Motley gave about Thurgood
Marshall's leadership and litigation campaign. It was not simply
separate education. She spoke of other cases, the restrictive cov-
enant cases, most notably Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), interstate
travel, the teacher salary cases, and most of all, I think, in terms
of your question, the early voting cases.
  Remember the white primary cases. The last case in that line,
Terry v. Adams, was decided in 1953, just one year before Brown.
People were shut out of the political process. There was
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, Judge, let me interrupt you, if I may.
Are you saying that if there is a dead end on the political process--
maybe you don't want to commit yourself to this, but a Supreme
Court judge may very well decide that is more of a time to lead
than to follow, which has got to be more of a subjective decision
as to when the political dead end has come? For instance, the equal
right amendment, you are a strong advocate of that, and others are
not. I happen to agree with you and have supported that, but it ap-
pears to be at a political dead end, which would lead me to con-
clude, if that is accurate--because the States are not going to ratify
it, as we can see--that in that area of equal rights for women the
Court should lead.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator DeConcini, first let me clarify what I
meant by a dead-end street. I meant that blacks couldn't vote. We
know what the history of the white primaries and literacy tests
were. Women became galvanized in the 1970's. I think we are
                                      169
going to see more and more political activity for advancement of
women's stature. Some of the results of that activity are visible in
this room. I don't think it has stopped.

  That doesn't mean that I am not an advocate of a statement in
our fundamental instrument of government that equality of rights
shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex. I am and I

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, Judge, I would classify you as a lead-
er. And I am not going to put words in your mouth, but that is how
I interpret what you have told us. My observation of what you have
told me here is that, certainly in the area of gender discrimination,
you lead. You don't follow. That is what you have done, though on
occasion, on many occasions, you have concurred with other judges,
but you certainly have been a leader there. That is really what I
wanted to know, and that doesn't trouble me.

  I think the Court should lead, particularly in that area, and I
was only trying to develop when you should follow, if there is any
philosophy you have that there is a time to follow and a time to
lead. It sounds to me like you are going to lead, and I think that
is fine with me.

  Judge GINSBURG. I won't comment on that. As I said, I have
given you examples from the past.

  Senator DECONCINI. That is fine. You have answered it suffi-
ciently for me, Judge, unless you want to make any other clarifying
statement.

  Judge GINSBURG. If you are satisfied with my answer, I will be
glad to move on.

  Senator DECONCINI. I am. Thank you for pursuing it.
  Judge you have written extensively on the judicial role in our
constitutional system, and as you have stated, throughout its his-
tory the Federal judiciary has been attacked repeatedly for exceed-
ing the bounds of its authority. The term that is usually bandied
about is "judicial activism." The committee questionnaire that we
sent to you when you were nominated asked you to comment on
the role relating to judicial activism, and you stated that the term
judicial activism "seems to me much misperceived, a label too often
pressed into service by critics of the Court results rather than the
legitimacy of Court decisions." I tend to agree with that.
  In the past, conservatives have used it to criticize decisions by
a liberal court, and now today's liberals are using it to criticize the
conservative Court decisions. Nonetheless, going back to your
quote, "The Court can and does exceed the bounds of its authority."
  Can you name any instances where you think the Court exceeded
the bounds of its authority in the past?
  Judge GINSBURG. Are you pointing to something in my answer to
the questionnaire?
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes. Well, in your answer to the question-
naire regarding judicial activism, you are quoted as saying, "seems
to be much misperceived, a label too often pressed into service by
critics of Court results rather than the legitimacy of Court deci-
sions." And I am just interested in knowing if you have any specif-
ics where you felt the Court in the past might have exceeded the
bounds of its authority. Perhaps you don't.
  Judge GINSBURG. The examples I gave were of the cases in which
the courts have been most criticized. Frankly, I criticized in return
                                      170

the legislatures and the executives who wouldn't take action when
they should have. I spoke primarily of the school cases, the institu-
tional cases, hospital and prison cases. These are cases, I observed,
that courts do not like; judges feel extremely uncomfortable having
to deal with them. But I gave the example, I think, of Judge John-
son in Alabama who was severely criticized for attempting to run
the prisons in Alabama. He gave this account of it. He said, "The
State's attorney stood up in my court and said that every prison
in this State is in violation of the eighth amendment." At that
point, what the law required him to do was clear. His own com-
petence to do it, he was most doubtful about that, but he was
bound by the law--by the Nation's highest law--to supply a rem-
edy.

  He explained how he tried in every way to have that remedy
come from the State officials, but in the end, when it didn't, the
Court has to supply it.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, you don't have any cases that you
cite where you think the Court has gone beyond its bounds of au-
thority? You can't think of any or that you have mentioned in your
lectures or your writings?

  Judge GINSBURG. As I said, I think the courts have gotten the
most heat for that institutional litigation--for trying to run schools,
for trying to run hospitals.

  Senator DECONCINI. But in your opinion, you don't cite any as
going beyond what your quotient or ratio or judgment might be as
the bounds of the Court's authority to do so.

  Justice Holmes, to whom you made reference in your Madison
lecture, talks about judges who do and must legislate. Do you agree
with that?

  Judge GINSBURG. Then he said they must do so interstitially.
  Senator DECONCINI. That is right.
  Judge GINSBURG. I think I gave an example. One of the Senators
referred to it; perhaps it was Senator Specter yesterday. It was in
an article I wrote about a series of cases in which the Court acted,
in effect, as an interim legislature. The article concerned the appro-
priate remedy when someone is challenging a classification that af-
fords benefits and says, "I want in."
  Sharron Frontiero's suit was such a case. So was Stephen
Wiesenfeld's.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU think those were proper that the
Court
  Judge GINSBURG. Either way, the Court is, in effect, legislating.
Let me explain what I mean.
  The Frontiero (1973) case involved housing allowance and medi-
cal facilities for a spouse, benefits automatically available for the
spouse of a male member of the military, but not available for the
spouse of a female member unless she supplied effectively three-
quarters of the family's support, all of her own plus half of his.
  The Court said that the gender line was invalid. Now, if at that
point the Court had said, "And until the legislature convenes again,
there shall be no housing allowance, no medical benefits for any-
body," that would have been far more destructive of the legislative
will than letting in the women members who had been left out.
                                      171
  The same is true in Stephen Wiesenfeld's case. The benefit he
sought was labeled a mother's benefit. He never would
  Senator DECONCINI. SO you draw the line as to how far the Court
goes beyond just deciding the issue as to the particular individual
or the class that is before you and whether or not they extend
themselves, as you just pointed out. Is it your position that that
would have been going too far?
  Judge GlNSBURG. No. My position is one should be honest about
what the Court has to do in that situation. And either way, the
Court can be said to be legislating. If the Court strikes down what
the legislature has ordered, it is legislating by removing benefits
Congress clearly wanted there to be.
  If the result in the Wiesenfeld (1975) case had been to strike
down the mother's benefit until Congress acted, that is the last
thing I think the sensible person would say Congress wanted to do.
  In the cases to which I referred, the Court has to make a deci-
sion. Its remedy was essentially legislative. The legislature has a
next session and can change it. The legislature can say we don't
want any parent to have benefits, we want every parent to have
benefits, or we want to do something in between, for example, have
an income test. But a court, on the spot, of necessity, must serve
as a surrogate legislature. Courts can't say, we don't want to decide
this case, we are going to leave it and do something else.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator DeConcini. And
thank you, Judge, for answering Senator DeConcini's question. I
now understand much better.
  Senator Grassley is next.
  Senator GRASSLEY. From Iowa. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that part. I just wasn't sure wheth-
er Senator Simpson finished yesterday. But Senator Grassley from
Iowa and the Judiciary Committee.
  Senator GRASSLEY. The State where you campaigned for Presi-
dent.
  The CHAIRMAN. I might add the obvious: very unsuccessfully.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, good morning again, Judge Ginsburg.
  Judge GINSBURG. Good morning, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to continue some of the discus-
sion of judicial philosophy with you this morning, with particular
emphasis, a little later on, on things that interest me about the
speech or debate clause in Congress and the application of laws of
general applicability to the Congress, laws that we have exempted
ourselves from.
  But before I ask my first question, I would like to make one ob-
servation from some of your statements yesterday. You spoke very
eloquently about the obstacles that you encountered as a woman
and particularly as a Jewish woman. You faced many hurdles in
your very distinguished career, and you mentioned them very clear-
ly-
  These barriers that you were speaking about yesterday remind
me of the compelling stories that Justice Clarence Thomas told us
almost 2 years ago about facing segregation in the South, about
drinking from a water fountain reserved only for blacks.
                                      172
  I think that it is very useful for us, and the country as a whole,
to know how discrimination has influenced your life. There are
similarities in life experiences but, of course, in the final analysis
they may not influence you and Justice Thomas in quite the same
way. Just an observation I wanted to make from yesterday.
  In the article that you wrote for the Rutgers Law Review--and
I believe it was based on a speech that you gave--you expressed
a view that the courts are not the solvers of all society's problems.
Your view seems very consistent with the belief held by Justice
John Marshall Harlan that the courts cannot solve all the ills of
our society. He expressed that very eloquently in the 1964 reappor-
tionment case.
  There Justice Harlan wrote, "The Constitution is not a panacea
for every blot upon the public body, nor should this Court, ordained
as a judicial body, be thought of as a haven for reform movements."
  Judges after all, are not elected, nor are they accountable to the
people. Would you agree that judges need to exercise self-restraint
and not endeavor to reform society? Isn't that a task better left to
the political branches?
  Yesterday you made reference to Fifth Circuit Judge Irving Gold-
berg, who said that "Judicial fire fighters must respond to all
cases." Those are his words. However, in responding, judges some-
times get carried away, it seems, by not only putting out the fire,
but also trying to rebuild the whole house.
  So my question, as well as those that I have generally stated
here, is: Shouldn't some of the fires and all of the rebuilding be left
to the Congress?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Judge Irving Goldberg, when he made that
comment, was talking about cases of a judiciary nature. The courts
hear only such controversies as the Constitution and the laws pro-
vide that courts shall hear. Courts may not hear cases for which
the Constitution does not provide, for which legislation does not
provide. But when the laws do provide for controversies of a judici-
ary nature, the judges must decide them. They have no choice.
  That is what I sought to convey. Justice Harlan would agree. He
is one of my heroes as a great Justice because he always told us
his reasoning--he never hid it; it was always spelled out with great
clarity. But he might have been accused of legislating because he
is responsible for paving the way for the cases I mentioned earlier,
in which the Court chose extension rather than invalidation to cure
a constitutional infirmity in a law. It was Harlan's concurring opin-
ion in a case called Welsh v. United States (1970) that prompted
me to be bold enough to say to the Court, we are asking you to ex-
tend not invalidate this law. I don't know that anyone has ever
called Harlan an activist for that, but this is the case I have in
mind. I will try to state it as briefly as I can.
  Welsh was a case of a conscientious objector who was denied CO
status. His conscientious objection to military service was based on
a deeply held philosophical belief, but it wasn't tied to a religion.
And the Congress, some thought, had pretty clearly limited CO sta-
tus to people whose religion dictated the position they were taking.
  Some of the Justices read the language of Congress, which
seemed to say the nontheistic observer isn't covered, nonetheless to
be broad or vague enough to cover Mr. Welsh. Justice Harlan said
                                      173
I can't do that. Congress was clear in saying this objection is avail-
able only to one who has a deeply held religious belief. That means
Congress has left out this man, a nontheistic conscientious objector.
That means I must grapple with the constitutional question, Is it
a violation of the first amendment to exempt from military service
only theistic objectors--to limit the exemption to one whose objec-
tion is tied to a belief in a Supreme Being? Harlan answered that
question, Yes, He than said, having read the law as Congress wrote
it, and having decided that that law is unconstitutional, I reach the
next step. Should that be to say there is no more CO exemption
until the legislature meets?

  No, Harlan reasoned. Instead, I must legislate a bit. I must in-
clude Mr. Welsh in the category of people who qualify for conscien-
tious objector status, because Congress wanted there to be such an
exemption. In Justice Harlan's judgment, Congress would have
chosen to include Mr. Welsh in the catalog of exempt people, rather
than to do away with the category CO, conscientious objectors, alto-
gether.

  Senator GRASSLEY. But you can agree, though, that sometimes
the courts get carried away with rewriting the law, and isn't it still
better to let Congress act? You have noted that in your Rutgers ar-
ticle, I believe. Am I misinterpreting

  Judge GiNSBURG. Congress makes the policy, it writes the laws.
Judges believe, as everyone else does, that that is what legislators
do in a democracy.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I suppose even judges get tired with the way
that it sometimes takes political branches so long to act. It takes
a long time, and we in this Congress certainly do not operate and
legislate with lightning speed.

  I think your Rutgers article expressed an understanding of this.
You just stated it. You were talking specifically there about civil
rights, and you advocated pressing in the legislatures and the bu-
reaucracy and in the arena of public education. You noted that this
effort would "require more patience, planning, and persistence than
campaigns aimed at sweeping victories in the court, but success
may be more secure."

  Is this because the courts are conservative and you see them as
inhospitable to reform? Or is it because policy made by the legisla-
tures is often more widely supported within society and, therefore,
more accepted and probably even more enduring?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Grassley, for a host of reasons. One, is
courts are not equipped to get the kind of information that legisla-
tors can get. You are addressing a problem, for example, what kind
of legislation you should have to prevent air pollution. You have
tremendous resources you can use to investigate, to find out about
the problems you are confronting. Legislatures can engage in the
kind of fact-finding that courts are not set up to do.

  Of course, the fundamental policy decisions are entrusted to the
legislative branch. The Court hears a controversy, one of a judici-
ary nature, generally between two parties.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Obviously, the Constitution requires us to
write the law, but is it your feeling that the people are more apt
to accept it than if a court would make that decision?
                                      174
  Judge GlNSBURG. People elect Members of Congress to make
laws for them, and if people don't like those laws, they can vote out
the people who made them.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I believe that you have been very clear in es-
tablishing Congress as the fundamental law-making branch and
that you don't want the courts to be assuming that role.
  I would like to contrast the view I think you express with an ad-
mittedly older law review article that you wrote, one based more
on your experience as an advocate of gender equality. It comes
from the 1979 Cleveland State Law Review article on repairing un-
constitutional legislation. There you said the Court would have to
"serve as a short-term surrogate for the legislature in rewriting
laws."
  I have some concern with such a viewpoint. Sometimes it can get
into dangerous territory. Senator Thurmond yesterday pointed out
some of that danger, like in Missouri v. Jenkins, when the Court
ordered a tax increase. Can you tell me what you will do in the face
of a statute you find inconsistent with the Constitution? Will you
be more inclined--and I think the key words here are "more in-
clined"--to rewrite the law, or simply to strike it down and let the
legislature do the rewriting?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The line of cases I examined in that Cleveland
State Law Review article are the ones I have been talking about.
Frontiero (1973), would Congress have wanted at that moment for
the Court to remove housing allowances and medical and dental
benefits for all dependents of servicemen? In the Wiesenfeld (1975)
case, would Congress have wanted the courts to say there shall be
no mothers' benefits until the legislature meets again?
  In the latest case in that line, Califano v. Westcott (1979), Con-
gress passed a law that originally was an unemployed parent law--
one parent that once had an attachment to the work force, but was
out of work for a prolonged period. There was an unemployment
benefit for such a person. It was discovered that in many cases the
person signing up as the unemployed parent was the mother, not
the father.
  Congress, apparently surprised, changed that law from an unem-
ployed parent benefit to an unemployed father benefit. That law
was challenged by a few unemployed mothers whose husbands had
lost their attachment to the work force so long ago that they didn't
qualify, but the mothers did. The plaintiffs in that case were effec-
tively asking the Court, until the legislature meets again, to
change the benefit back to one for an unemployed parent, rather
than an unemployed father.
 / And the Supreme Court, in 1979, faced up to what Justice Har-
Ijan had said much earlier in Welsh v. United States (1970). It said
yes, we have a choice to make. Either way, whether we extend or
we invalidate, we are temporarily legislating. The question for us
is this: If Congress knew the line it drew was unconstitutional,
would Congress want us to take away the benefit totally, or would
Congress want us to extend it to the small class that had been left
out. The Justices were trying to divine congressional intent. And
the opinions in that case plainly show that members of the Court
agree there is a choice. In the particular instance, the Westcott
                                      175
case, the Court divided on whether extension or invalidation was
the proper remedy.

  But Harlan's point was accepted by the entire Court. In Califano
v. Westcott (1979), on the question of the existence of a choice, all
of the Justices, in 1979, agreed. They said yes, we must choose; at
this moment we are the surrogate legislature. I didn't mean to
carry my point any further than that kind of case, one in which
Congress legislates a benefit for a large class, the benefit is con-
stitutionally infirm, because it leaves out a group of people simi-
larly situated. What, then, is the remedy? I endeavored in that
Cleveland article to talk about that discrete category of cases.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU might consider that if the courts act too
broadly, that legislatures might not fulfill their responsibilities.
With the answer you just gave me, then, I think you are inclined
to tell me that you are very willing to strike down a law and not
very willing to rewrite it, if it is in conflict with the Constitution.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think all of the judges in those cases, in all
of the courts, agreed that the one thing we couldn't do is rewrite
the law in detail. Legislators might come up with something in be-
tween, or redo the law entirely. But a court in such cases has just
the stark choice between extension or invalidation. Courts can't
craft something finer as the legislature might do when it looks at
the matter again.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to move on to the subject of
speech and debate. Your circuit, of course, hears many cases invok-
ing the Constitution's speech or debate clause, which provides, as
you know, that no Member of Congress can be questioned in any
other place for any speech or debate in either House. The clause,
of course, has long been a popular basis for Congress and individ-
ual members to avoid liability under a variety of criminal and civil
laws.

  I have often debated with my colleagues the clause when I pro-
posed amendments to apply employment laws to the Senate. Oppo-
nents of such coverage hide behind the speech or debate clause or
claim that sexual harassment or racial discrimination in a congres-
sional office is completely immunized. Congressional employees,
unlike private sector workers, or even people employed by the Fed-
eral bureaucracy, have, for instance, no statutory right to unionize
or earn a minimum wage or overtime pay.

  Because of my interest in this provision of article I, I was, of
course, delighted to read your opinions narrowly construing the
clause. I was particularly impressed with your opinion in Walker
v. Jones. In that case, you rejected, as I read it, the House's argu-
ment that the clause immunized the House Services Subcommittee
from a sex discrimination action. As you remember, that was the
case where the subcommittee chairman declared that a House res-
taurant director's $45,000 a year salary was "ridiculous for a
woman." Those are his words.

  Am I correct in concluding, based on your opinions, that you see
no speech or debate clause problem with the application of civil
rights or labor laws to the administrative aspects, as opposed to
the legislative aspects of Congress' work and its employees?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Grassley, I think I will stay with Ella
Walker's case, because the question you ask conceivably could come
                                      176
up in a live case. I am delighted that you think well of our decision.
I can tell you some people in the House of Representatives didn't.
As you know, they regarded the speech or debate clause as sacred,
and they said, well, of course our restaurant has a connection to
legislating. How can you legislate if you are not well-fed?

  In Ella Walker's case, we said we don't have to deal with any-
thing other than auxiliary services. In contrast, concerning mem-
bers of a representative's staff working on legislation, one could
make an argument for connection to the job of legislating that one
could not make regarding auxiliary services. We thought we could
draw a clear line between legislating and going to the gym, having
a meal, going to a parking lot. I don't know if there are any attend-
ants in the restrooms. But those areas we said were beyond the
zone of legislating covered by the speech or debate clause.

  I think you know of the case of Davis v. Passman (1979). That
case shows why I don't want to talk about administrative staff.
That case involved a Member of Congress, a Representative who
wrote a letter to a woman who had been his legislative assistant
on a temporary basis. The letter praised the temporary assistant,
but then said, you're so sweet and lovely and this job is so hard,
it's really a job for a man. Davis charged Congressman Passman
with sex discrimination, in violation of the equal protection compo-
nent of the fifth amendment. One of Passman's defenses was the
speech or debate clause.

  The Supreme Court, in deciding that the plaintiff in that case
had stated a claim, left open the speech or debate question, because
it hadn't been decided by the court below. When the case went back
for a decision on speech or debate immunity for Passman's action,
the case was settled. So that question was never decided by the
Fifth Circuit or by the Supreme Court. That is why I would like
to stay with my auxiliary service case, Ella Walker's case, and not
go beyond that.

  I do think, and have expressed this in writing, that when Con-
gress enacts a measure like title VII, it should set a good example
by saying we are not simply going to ask the private sector to end
discrimination, we are going to do it ourselves, we are going to hold
ourselves to the same standards we expect of the public.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let's follow on with what you just said there,
because I think the speech or debate clause necessarily leads us to
the issue of the doctrine of separation of powers.

  As I debate congressional coverage, I am repeatedly told by my
colleagues that the separation of powers precludes some Federal
agencies from investigating claims against a Member of Congress.
The argument tends to be that it would be unconstitutional for an
executive department, it would be an unconstitutional infringe-
ment, I suppose, on legislative power to have, for instance, an
OSHA investigator check out this hearing room, to see whether or
not there were any safety violations here, or to have the Civil
Rights Division or EEOC pursue remedies for discrimination
against congressional employees in a Federal trial court.

  First of all, do you see any separation of power problems with an
agency that has expertise in an area insuring that Congress com-
plies with laws?
                                      177
  Judge GINSBURG. Again, Senator Grassley, I think I must avoid
expressing anything concerning
  Senator GRASSLEY. I can appreciate that. Let me just ask you if
you could generally discuss how you might determine a separation
of powers boundaries in the Constitution in such a case?
  Judge GINSBURG. May I offer an example from real life, some-
thing that happened to me. It explains why I am sensitive on this
subject.
  There was a case before my court, titled Murray v. Buchanan
(1983). It was a challenge not to the offices of the chaplains in the
House and Senate. The case, in some accounts, has been inac-
curately portrayed. There was no challenge to opening the sessions
of the Senate and the House with prayer. There was never any
challenge to having a chaplain. But there was in that case a chal-
lenge to using taxpayer money to fund the offices of the chaplains.
  The people who brought that suit were not very popular people--
Murray was the name, the son of Madeline O'Hare Murray was the
lead plaintiff. The only question before my court was whether the
plaintiffs had standing to raise their objection in court, or whether
it constituted a political question.
  The standing question seemed to me governed by a case clearly
on point, Flast v. Cohen (1968). We asked the lawyers in the argu-
ment of that case--because there seemed to be a straight-forward
legal question with no fact record to develop--if we should hold
that there is standing, that the case is justiciable, can we get sup-
plemental briefs and proceed to decide the merits? Both parties
said, no, if you are going to hold that the case is justiciable, send
it back to the district court because there are historical materials
we would like to place in the record. So we were told by the parties
that they did not want the court of appeals, at that stage, to decide
the merits of the case.
  A panel on which I served--a divided panel, it was 2 to 1--held
that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the case. There was a
strong reaction. The House of Representatives adopted a resolution
saying that the court had acted improperly, had encroached on the
legislature's domain, had meddled in a matter covered by the
House Rules. There was no nay vote in the House. Representative
Conyers abstained; otherwise, the House was unanimous. That res-
olution was indeed a telling legislative reaction to a decision per-
ceived as an improper judicial incursion on legislative turf.
  My court, the full court, vacated the three-judge panel decision,
so it does not appear in the Federal Reporter. It was in the ad-
vance sheet, but the decision was vacated before the opinions could
be put in the bound volume. You have the opinions before you,
however, in the collection of my decisions.
  I recount that episode to indicate how sensitive these questions
are, how
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, there wouldn't be any question about
separation of powers protecting Members of Congress from applica-
bility of criminal laws. What principled distinction can there be
made with having employment laws or civil rights laws applied to
Congress?
  Judge GINSBURG. YOU might ask the counsel to the Senate, who
argued very effectively in a number of speech or debate clause
                                      178
cases before us, for a brief on that subject. That office would be
best qualified to address the issue for a Senate audience.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I believe before long you will be ad-
dressing it sometime. Obviously that would keep you from respond-
ing to a specific question, but

  Judge GlNSBURG. If and when the question is presented, I would
have the benefit of briefs on both sides. That is the difficulty that
I confront in this milieu. I am accustomed--as a judge, it is the
only way I can operate--to considering cases on a full record, with
briefs and often oral arguments. I am not accustomed to making
general statements apart from a concrete case for which I am fully
prepared, taking into account the arguments parties present on
both sides.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, it seemed to me like you did address
the issue pretty thoroughly in your 1987 speech to the 92d Street
Y in New York. You noted Congress exempts itself--and you re-
ferred to this just a little while ago--from title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and prohibition of race and sex discrimination.
You said, drawing on John Locke and Madison's Federalist 10 that
"One might plausibly contend that Congress violates the spirit if
not the letter of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers
when it exonerates itself from the imposition of the laws it obliges
people outside the legislature to obey."

  Maybe you are even afraid to elaborate on those remarks.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I did say "spirit," but there is a much simpler
way of stating the point. It is that one should practice what one
preaches.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I am sorry. Would you repeat that?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I used the words "violates the spirit if not the
letter." But there is a much simpler way, without referring to
Locke, to express that idea: One should practice what one preaches
with respect to equal employment.
  Senator GRASSLEY. It seemed to me like something that you
would be very concerned about on your present court or even on
the Supreme Court, that the applicability of these laws to Congress
is surely a check on legislative tyranny, and you have got to be con-
cerned about legislative tyranny.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I think my time is up.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Thank you, Senator.
  I want to acknowledge Senator Grassley's leadership in this area
of public policy, on the applicability of statutes to the Congress. He
has been interested in it for a long period of time. Quite frankly,
I think we have made impressive progress in the Civil Rights Act
of this last year and some of the recent statutes, but it is obviously
an issue which we are grappling with. And I think your comments
in the Walker case give at least some indication about your own
views on this issue, one that I think is of enormous importance, ob-
viously to the institution and I think to the American public gen-
erally.
  Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge actually I want, a little later on, to get back to Murray v.
Buchanan. I think that you were critical of Judge MacKinnon's
                                      179
concurrence in the sense that he is citing the political question doc-
trine as a way out. And I will go into that a little bit further.

  I must say, though, sometimes when I approach these nomina-
tion hearings, the only enthusiasm that I can get up is because I
wasn't able to find something more interesting like a root canal to
go through. You have been entirely different. As I said last night
at the close, I have enjoyed this very much because of your obvious
love of the law and what I discern to be a very real interest in hav-
ing the law do what it is supposed to do to protect the rights of
individuals.

  There was some discussion yesterday of Lemon, and I have with
past nominees gone into that question at some length. A lot of it
was covered yesterday, but I just want to make sure I fully under-
stand your answers.

  First off, do you feel the Supreme Court today has a clear test
for deciding establishment clause cases?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) test remains
the test that the Court has.

  Senator LEAHY. IS that their test today, in your estimation?
  Judge GlNSBURG. They have no other that the Court has ever an-
nounced. The test has been criticized by some of the Justices. Sen-
ator Metzenbaum read yesterday from a dissent with rather strong
criticism. But the Supreme Court has not supplanted that test.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, let's go back to yesterday because you had
said that before a judge or Justice tears down a
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Or "deconstructs," I believe was your expression,
deconstructs an established test, he or she should ask, Well, what
is the alternative?
  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator LEAHY. Today, what do you think the appropriate test
for establishment clause cases should be?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I don't have a satisfactory alternative.
This is a very difficult area. I can say only that I am open to argu-
ments, to ideas, but at this moment, as I said yesterday, I have no
solution to offer. I do know that it is easy to criticize. It is not so
easy to offer an alternative.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you given thought to the alternative? Be-
cause you know you are going to be faced with these questions.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. I haven't had much establishment clause
business
  Senator LEAHY. YOU are going to.
  Judge GINSBURG [continuing]. Apart from the standing issues
which came up in two cases, Murray v. Buchanan (1983) and Kurtz
v. Baker (1987).
  The only case that I have had that touched at all on the estab-
lishment clause was the marijuana sacrament case, the Olsen
(1989) case, where
  Senator LEAHY. This is the Ethiopian
  Judge GINSBURG. Right, the Zion Coptic Church case. So you are
right that I will have to think in a harder, more focused way, as
I always do when I have a case to decide.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, I certainly don't want you to have to lay
out a test here in the abstract which might determine what your
                                      180
vote or your test would be in a case you have yet to see that may
well come before the Supreme Court. But because there has been
so much dispute over Lemon and other cases that seem to branch
off or go at it since then, you know and I know that this is an issue
that will be before the Supreme Court, if not next year, then the
year after.

  But I would like to get some idea of your feelings, and let me ap-
proach it this way: Under the first amendment's freedom of religion
guarantee, people expect that if they send their children to public
school, for example, that the establishment clause is going to pro-
hibit the school from forcing religion on them. At the same time,
they know they also have the free exercise clause, and we have a
right to practice our religion, to have nonpublic religious schools.
I think in my own experience my children have been both to pri-
vate religious schools and to public schools, and there is no ques-
tion in my mind that there are real differences in what is allowed
or not allowed in the two.

  Do you see a tension between the establishment and the free ex-
ercise clause?

  Judge GlNSBURG. There are cases that raise a tension. I am not
prepared here to discuss those cases specifically, but you mentioned
public schools, on the one hand, and private schools--that may be
religious schools--on the other. Some crossovers do not create in-
tractable problems, as the Supreme Court indicated fairly recently.
For example, suppose a school facility is available after hours. Can
the school board say we are not going to allow a religious group to
use the facilities, because we don't want the State to be acknowl-
edging religion in any way? The Supreme Court said if the facility
is open on a first-come, first-served basis to anyone, the school's au-
thorities can't exclude a group on the ground of religion. That posi-
tion does not involve the State in establishing religion. Instead, it
allows room for people freely to exercise their religion, as long as
they are not being treated differently from any other group.

  Senator LEAHY. Does that mean that the free exercise clause and
the establishment clause are equal, or is one subordinate to the
other?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I prefer not to address a question like that;
again, grand principles have to be applied in concrete cases. My job
involves reasoning from the specific case and not

  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this: Do you have a view wheth-
er the Supreme Court today has put one in a subordinate position
to the other?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The two clauses are on the same line in the
Constitution. I don't see that it is a question of subordinating one
to the other. Both must be given effect. They are both

  Senator LEAHY. But there are instances where both cannot be
upheld.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I would prefer to await a particular
case and

  Senator LEAHY. I understand. Just trying, Judge. Just trying.
  Let me move on a little bit, then, to free exercise. Let's take the
Leahy case. Leahy v. District of Columbia, that is. In Leahy v. Dis-
trict, does your ruling mean that you are not going to let the first
amendment right of the free exercise of religion be trampled on or
                                      181

compromised just because there is legislation intended for public
safety? Or what did you intend?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Leahy (1987), so it won't be a mystery to
  Senator LEAHY. It is a different Leahy. We ought to put that
down. No relation to this Leahy.
  Judge GINSBURG. And perhaps I should explain what that case
involved.
  Leahy applied for a driver's license in the District of Columbia.
As District driver's licenseholders know, the license number here
coincides with--it is the same as--one's Social Security number.
Leahy's religious belief involved a rejection of identification with a
Social Security number. If he were to use that number to identify
himself, he would very substantially reduce his chances for an
after-life. That was his religious belief.
  The District said this is our system. Every driver must have a
driver's license, and these are our numbers. But something else
came out in that case. Because this city has many people who don't
have Social Security numbers, diplomats, it did have another sys-
tem of numbers it used for embassies. And Leahy's religious belief
could have been accommodated by the city; at least we sent it back
to determine why the city could not respect his religious belief--
we said that in the interest of free exercise there had to be a com-
pelling reason to require Leahy to choose between his faith and his
driver's license.
  Senator LEAHY. In fact, if I could quote from it, you said, that
requiring a Social Security number was not "the least restrictive
means of achieving the vital public safety objective at stake." I in-
terpret that as saying you would hold public safety legislation to
a strict standard of review if first amendment freedoms are impli-
cated.
  Am I reading your opinion correctly?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, you are reading my opinion correctly. I
was applying the test then effective, looking closely at such a re-
striction and requiring the State to come up with a compelling jus-
tification for not making an accommodation. The decision suggested
in a footnote that perhaps there could be no compelling justification
given this alternate system of license numbers the city had. But we
remanded the case on that point. We said it wasn't enough to say
every driver must have a driver's license and so either you get one
that we provide or you don't drive.
  Senator LEAHY. Again, for anybody who tunes in late, so that ev-
erybody won't go off and try to check my bio to see who my rel-
atives are, the Leahy referred to here is no relative, and obviously
a different religion. [Laughter.]
  Judge, let me follow a little bit from that, and I think these are
related. I would like to go to the Goldman v. Secretary of Defense
case, in which we had an officer who had served, I believe, 14 or
15 years with distinction. He was threatened with a court-martial
because he wore a yarmulke. You wanted to make the military ex-
plain why it was necessary to prohibit the wearing of the
yarmulke, and I recall reading in your decision basically that he
served with distinction all these years and nobody had questioned
it, and all of a sudden it became an issue. But the majority of the
                                      182
judges on the District of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court
sided with the military.

  You wrote that the military showed callous indifference to the of-
ficer's orthodox Jewish religious faith by denying him the right to
wear a yarmulke.

  How much accommodation should the military be required to
make to protect the freedom of religion in the first amendment?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Leahy, may I say first that the major-
ity of the District of Columbia Circuit did not uphold that classi-
fication. What we did was vote to deny a rehearing en bane. The
Air Force regulation was upheld by a three-judge panel. As I recall,
the writing judge was a visiting judge, and two of my colleagues
voted with him to uphold the military uniform regulation.

  Senator LEAHY. I am concerned with what your views were. You
had written that the military showed callous indifference to Gold-
man's religious beliefs. My basic question, though, without going
into that case, is how much accommodation should the military be
required to do to make the freedom of religion guarantees of the
first amendment real guarantees, or how do you determine how
much accommodation?

  Judge GINSBURG. There was a divided decision in the Supreme
Court upholding my court's decision that a uniform regulation has
to be applied uniformly. That was the decision of the majority of
the Supreme Court.

  Our Constitution is the Constitution for all of us. It is the most
fundamental law for this body and for all of the people. The end
of Capt. Simcha Goldman's case was that this body, Congress,
passed a law that said the Air Force can accommodate to the
yarmulke. By that action, this body was implementing the free ex-
ercise clause in an entirely proper way, in my judgment.

  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this in a very general way:
Whether it is the military or public safety departments, is it not
a fact that they have to make accommodations to free speech?
There may be special circumstances, because of the nature of the
military or the nature of public safety, but at least they must start
out assuming there has to be accommodation to the right of free
speech or the right of religion?

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I think that is quite right. Our tradition
has been one of many religions, one of tolerance and mutual re-
spect.

  Senator LEAHY. What about right of association?
  Judge GINSBURG. In what context? We also have first amend-
ment protection for that, and the right to petition the Government
to redress our grievances.
  Senator LEAHY. Simply serving in the military or in a public
safety organization does not remove your rights of association.
  Judge GINSBURG. I think that is quite correct. It doesn't mean
that you have the same rights of association in the military that
you would have in civilian life. There are undoubtedly restrictions,
if you are a member of the military, that control you, but your con-
stitutional rights don't end. They are fitted to the setting in which
you are placed.
  Senator LEAHY. Obviously, if we follow this to its logical conclu-
sion, we are going to get into what is going to be a major debate
                                      183
before the courts within the next year, so I will stop at that point.
I would note for the record, for those who might, that they should
review your dissenting statement in Goldman and your citing of
Judge Starr's dissenting opinion.

  To go back to your discussion with Senator Grassley and Senator
Metzenbaum yesterday, you talked of the case of the professor who
challenged the House and Senate on who was allowed to give pray-
ers. You pretty well knew his first amendment claim would be de-
nied, because of a prior Supreme Court case, but you wanted him
at least to be heard. I believe the court of appeals dismissed his
case, without hearing his constitutional arguments. Why did you
think it was important for him to have that day in court?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I don't think it is a political judgment. I don't
view the issue in terms whether I think it's important. Anyone who
comes to court with a justiciable controversy has access to the
court.

  Senator LEAHY. Politically sensitive or otherwise?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, judges in the first instance are not sup-
posed to have any choice in that matter. If the case is of a judiciary
nature, it is the judiciary's obligation to hear it, and it seemed to
me that the professor qualified under the precedent that governed.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you think the political question doctrine
should not be used? Should the question be whether a person has
a right to be heard?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think the political question doctrine is much
misunderstood. There are so many cases where what the Court is
saying is, essentially, we look at this issue and it has been commit-
ted, textually committed, to another branch of the Government.
You don't have to label that a political question. The Court has to
examine the question to determine if the Constitution has given it
over to another branch.
  What I said in my discussions and debates with my colleague
Judge MacKinnon on this subject is, you are really taking a merits-
first approach to these questions. You are deciding on the merits
that the Government is right, and then you are saying that it's a
political question or there is no standing. But really, you have
taken more than a peek at the merits. You have resolved the mer-
its against the plaintiff and then justified the result as a door-clos-
ing decision.
  Senator LEAHY. If it is any consolation to you, I am one member
of the more political branch of the Government who agrees with
you on that. I think you are right and I think the Court should not
shy away from those issues.
  Do you think there is a core political speech that is entitled to
greater constitutional protection than other forms of speech?
  Judge GINSBURG. That there is some kind of speech that is more
protected than other kinds, I think there is no question about that.
One kind of speech that is entirely outside the first amendment
under current doctrine is obscenity. Commercial speech doesn't get
quite the same protection as core political speech. Various expres-
sions fall somewhere in between, like indecent, but not obscene
speech.

          75-974 0 - 9 4 -- 7
                                      184
  So if you are asking me the question, is there only one kind of
speech and is all speech protected to the same extent, I think the
case law is clear that, no, that isn't the case.
  Senator LEAHY. Senator Simpson and you touched a little bit on
this yesterday, exploring whether Government can require recipi-
ents of Federal funds to express only those views that the Govern-
ment finds acceptable.
  In an FEC case last year, you said that: "Decisionmakers in all
three branches of Government should be alert to this reality: Tax-
ing and spending decisions--even those that might appear to offer
the individual a choice or to leave her no worse off than she would
have been absent Government involvement--can seriously interfere
with the exercise of constitutional freedoms."
  Let's take a few examples. Could the Government, for example,
to further a policy in favor of promoting democratic participation,
give out subsidies only to, say, Republican voters or only to Demo-
cratic voters?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I am so glad that you brought that up,
because that issue came up yesterday at a point when I was, to be
frank, very tired. I gave a glib answer that I should have qualified,
an answer inconsistent with what I said in the DKT (1989) case.
I said yesterday that the Government can buy Shakespeare and not
modern theater. That answer still stands, but what the Govern-
ment cannot do is buy Republican speech and not Democratic
speech, buy white speech and not black speech, and that
  Senator LEAHY. Let's take it a little bit further, then. I thought
you might want to elaborate on it a little bit, and that is why I
thought I would ask the question today. Could the Government, to
further a policy in favor of protecting the public from sexually ex-
plicit material, for example, prohibit libraries that receive public
funds from making Alice Walker's "The Color Purple," or J.D. Sal-
inger's "Catcher in the Rye" available to patrons, but allow some-
thing else?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I must avoid giving an advisory opinion on any
specific scenario, because, as clear as it may seem to you, that sce-
nario might come before me. Some of these matters are in a state
of flux now, for example, what falls within this category of indecent
speech, to what extent can it be regulated. I can state quite com-
fortably what is, to the extent that I comprehended what the cur-
rent law is, but I must avoid responding to hypothetical, because
they may prove not to be so hypothetical.
  Senator LEAHY. Let's go into that a little bit. Hypothetically,
could you give funds to a college and say, because we want to
maintain the family, we don't want you to put anything in your so-
ciology course about divorce or illegitimacy, and so on and so forth?
We could pick up a dozen kinds of examples that have great sound-
ing names from whatever funding body is using taxpayers' money.
Or could the Government, to protect the integrity of a new com-
puter highway or the Internet, say, well, you can use the network,
but you can't put this type of political speech on it. Those are tough
questions and I can see them coming before the Court.
  But what general standard do you feel today, at least, the Gov-
ernment should apply to Government restrictions on speech tied to
Federal funding? Is there a standard today?
                                      185
  Judge GINSBURG. We know that the most dangerous thing the
Government can do is to try to censor speech on the basis of the
viewpoint that is being expressed. We are uncomfortable with con-
tent regulation, generally, but particularly uncomfortable with at-
tempts to certain statements of particular point of view.
  I might mention the military base case, the Spock (1976) case:
The Court said it was all right for the military to say no political
speech on the base. But suppose the question had been, we will
allow Republican and Democratic Party speech, but not Labor
Party speech.
  Now, that would have been a very troublesome thing for Govern-
ment to be doing. It is one thing to ban the category, even though
it is content-based regulation--no political speech. But if the Gov-
ernment were to say that we regard this speech as safe and that
speech is unsafe, it would run up against the motivating force for
the first amendment. Shortly after the Revolutionary War, there
was a political cartoon that snowed a Tory being carted off, and the
caption read: "Liberty of speech for those who speak the speech of
Liberty." That is what we have to be on our guard against. The
message of the first amendment is tolerance of speech, not the
speech we agree with, but the speech we hate.
  Senator LEAHY. Some could say that is the underpinning of our
whole democracy, to allow that kind of diversity, and no other
country protects it as we do.
  Senator Metzenbaum had asked you whether the right to choose
is a fundamental right. Is there a constitutional right to privacy?
  Judge GINSBURG. There is a constitutional right to privacy com-
posed of at least two distinguishable parts. One is the privacy ex-
pressed most vividly in the fourth amendment: The Government
shall not break into my home or my office without a warrant, based
on probable cause; the Government shall leave me alone.
  The other is the notion of personal autonomy. The Government
shall not make my decisions for me. I shall make, as an individual,
uncontrolled by my Government, basic decisions that affect my
life's course. Yes, I think that what has been placed under the label
privacy is a constitutional right that has those two elements, the
right to be let alone and the right to make basic decisions about
one's life's course.
  Senator LEAHY. And absent a very compelling reason, the Gov-
ernment cannot interfere with that right?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. I realize we are painting in broad strokes here,
but am I correctly reflecting your answer?
  Judge GINSBURG. The Government must have a good reason, if
it is going to intrude on one's privacy or autonomy. The fourth
amendment expresses it well with respect to the privacy of one's
home. The Government should respect the autonomy of the individ-
ual, unless there is reason tied to the community's health or safety.
We live in communities and I must respect the health and well-
being of others. So if I am not going to accord that respect on my
own, the Government appropriately requires me to recognize that
I live in a community with others and can't push my own decision-
making to the point where it would intrude on the autonomy of
others.
                                      186
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, my time is up on this round, but I appre-
ciate your answers, and I understand in some of them why you do
not want to go further. I hope you understand, however, my rea-
sons in asking them.
  Judge GINSBURG. I do, Senator, and I thank you.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Judge, I apologize for being out of the room for part of the ques-
tioning. The new nominee for the FBI came by to meet me and to
see how quickly we could schedule a hearing, and it was suggested
by one of my colleagues to whom I introduced the Director--as a
matter of fact, my colleague from Pennsylvania--that, when we fin-
ish with you on Friday, we just start with him and keep going right
through the weekend. But I do apologize for having been absent for
about half an hour.
  Let me suggest that in a moment we break until 10 after 12,
break for 15 minutes, and then we will come back, with your per-
mission, Judge, and Senator Specter will lead off the questioning,
and then I believe Senator Heflin will follow. That will take us to
about 1:15, at which time we will break for lunch until 2:30, and
come back at 2:30 and continue with Senators Brown, Simon,
Cohen, Kohl, Pressler, Feinstein, and Moseley-Braun, in a series of
three.
  Judge GINSBURG. With a break in between?
  The CHAIRMAN. With a break in between, with a break every half
hour or sooner, if you conclude that that would be preferable. As
I said, we need to get up and stretch our legs. You are sitting there
the whole time, and we appreciate it.
  We will reconvene at 10 minutes after 12, in 15 minutes.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back, Judge. The floor is yours, Senator
Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, I was very much impressed with your opening
statement yesterday when you talked about your background lead-
ing to your values. I would like to take just a moment at the outset
to identify our commonality of background and values, because I
think we may or may not have some differences as to the appro-
priate role of the Court on enforcing those values.
  When you talked about discrimination, coming from a family
background of one parent first generation and one the second gen-
eration, I understand that. Both of my parents were immigrants.
When you talk about not having enough money to go to college, I
can understand that. Neither of my parents went to high school.
  And when you comment about having been in Pennsylvania and
having seen the sign, "No Jews or dogs," I reflected as a 17-year-
old graduating from high school in Kansas and the State university
not having any fraternities which admitted Jews, or graduating
from law school and finding employment opportunities shut off.
The fact was that Jews were excluded. There weren't any ref-
erences to dogs, however.
  The concern about discrimination is one that I have always felt
keenly on the issue of employing women. Shortly after you had
                                      187
problems finding employment, I actively recruited women as assist-
ant district attorneys in Philadelphia, starting with my election in
1965, and at one time had as many as 17 women, mostly as assist-
ant district attorneys, and some as legal interns moving up to the
rank of assistant D.A.

  We had a rather remarkable case in 1968 in which we had an
indeterminate sentence for women, a day to life, as opposed to a
determinate sentence for a man, say 5 to 10 for robbery. And it was
challenged on constitutional grounds, and I was the district attor-
ney of the county, and I refused to defend it. I said it was wrong,
confessed error and the State attorney general had to come in to
handle the case.

  When Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas, was sued in
Roe v. Wade, I was sued by Ms. Ryan, Ryan v. District Attorney
Arlen Specter. And I entered a statement, among others, that given
all the serious crimes I had to prosecute, I wasn't going to get in-
volved in the tough remedy of criminal sanctions on the abortion
issue.

  When you talk about the role of the Court and judicial activism,
the concern that I have is that if the Court is with you, it is great;
but I think about the Dred Scott Supreme Court, which perpet-
uated slavery, and the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court, which
kept discrimination and segregation in effect for more than a half-
century. I think of the Supreme Court in the 1930's, where the
strong conflict existed between the Court and Congress when legis-
lation was invalidated by a super-legislature Supreme Court on
substantive due process grounds. I think about some who today
challenge Marbury v. Madison, with the Supreme Court being the
ultimate decider of cases, some saying very seriously that the
President and the Congress have as much authority to interpret
the Constitution as the Court does, and some saying that there
ought not to be judicial review by the Federal courts unless you ad-
here to original intent because there is no legitimacy.

  Two of the Justices now sitting declined to answer questions on
what I consider a rockbed principle about whether the Congress
can take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United
States to decide constitutional issues. That is one of those matters
for me on which there is no alternative answer, but two of the Jus-
tices have declined to respond when questions were asked of them.

  When I read your writings--and I make a sharp distinction be-
tween your writings and your work on the court as I read your
opinions, but it is a concern I have, and not exclusively as to what
you would decide as a Justice but what you as an advocate would
argue to the Court to decide as being within the range of the
Court's power.

  I am only going to pick one, perhaps two, and get to a very short
question.

  When you commented in the Washington Law Quarterly to this
effect: "A boldly dynamic interpretation, departing radically from
the original understanding, is required to tie to the 14th amend-
ment's equal protection clause, a command that Government treat
men and women as individuals, equals in rights and responsibil-
ities and opportunities." And then concluding, referring to the judi-
                                      188
cial anxiety, the "uneasiness judges feel in the gray zone between
interpretation and alteration of the Constitution."

  And after that unduly lengthy introduction, the narrow question
I have for you is: Is it the role of the courts to upset decisions of
legislators based on the jurist's own ideas about enlightened policy
by bold, dynamic interpretation of the Constitution?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Specter, may I first join in what the
chairman has said, what your colleagues have said. I am so pleased
that you showed the care and concern to be here and that you are
looking so well.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, you were an inspiration to
me, hastened my recovery. There was a real motivation.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, there is no possibility we could hold a
major hearing and Senator Specter not be here.

  Judge GINSBURG. I could also say that I believe Marbury v.
Madison (1803) was rightly decided. I said already yesterday that
Dred Scott (1857) was wrong the day it was issued. There was no
justification for it.

  Senator SPECTER. I am glad to hear you say that because one
nominee would not affirm Marbury v. Madison, and one nominee
in the discussion in my office said, when I started off talking about
Marbury v. Madison, "You know, Senator, that case wasn't very
well reasoned." And I said, "No, I didn't know that."

  Judge GINSBURG. Then I would also like to say that I prize the
institution of judicial review for constitutionality. We have become
a model for the world in that respect, and that is one of the reasons
why I resist labels like "activism" and "restraint." I think it is a
very precious institution that we have, and it should not be abused.

  After World War II, nations in other parts of the world that
never had judicial review for constitutionality as part of their tradi-
tion adopted models compatible with their own systems but in-
spired by what our Supreme Court has been in our society. That
role needs to be guarded; it should be exercised with great care.

  Now, the Washington University Law Quarterly article you men-
tioned was about the need for, or utility of an equal rights amend-
ment. Why do we need an equal rights amendment when so many
people have said the equal protection clause suffices? That was the
topic of that article, was it not?

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, it went beyond that, and it
went to the point about having the Court extend what you cat-
egorized as a host of rights. It really was more in line with a state-
ment you made at the second circuit judicial conference in 1976,
where you put it this way: "The Supreme Court, by dynamic inter-
pretation of the equal protection principle, could have done every-
thing we asked today," and then, as an advocate, you had articu-
lated a number of rights which you were looking for. So that I
think it was beyond ratification of ERA. It was in your role as an
advocate.

  Judge GINSBURG. I don't know if my article in the Washington
University Law Quarterly is here. I do recall the second circuit con-
ference, and I do know that was a conference focused on the need
for the utility of an equal rights amendment. I recall that that was
a debate with Gloria Steinem and myself on one side and two gen-
tlemen on the other side.
                                      189

  The Washington University Law Quarterly article, which some-
body is going to try to get for me, was part of a series in the Wash-
ington University in St. Louis on the topic of equality. My specific
topic was gender discrimination. I think the title indicated that the
article dealt with the equal protection clause and the equal rights
amendment as safeguards of the fair and equal treatment of
women in our society.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, the title is "Sexual Equality
Under the Fourteenth and Equal Rights Amendments."

  Judge GINSBURG. Right. That is
  Senator SPECTER. The 14th amendment as well.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right, yes. The article contrasted having an
Equal Rights Amendment as distinguished from the equal protec-
tion clause as a guarantee of the equal citizenship of women before
the law.
  Senator SPECTER. Let us give you a copy of the article. We have
an extra here.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. This article is, as I said, an article in a
symposium on the quest for equality. There was one on race, one
on equal employment opportunity, one devoted to sexual equality
under the 14th amendment and the Equal Rights Amendment.
  That article, like the Second Circuit Judicial Conference talk, fo-
cused on two things: the equal protection clause as a guarantee of
the equal citizenship of women versus the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. That was the entire context of the article, and what I said
there was this: It is part of our history--a sad part of our history,
Senator Specter, but undeniably part of our history--that the 14th
amendment, that great amendment that changed so much in this
Nation, was not intended by its framers immediately to change the
status of women. And it is part of history that the leading feminists
of the day--Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia
Mott--campaigned against ratification of the 14th amendment be-
cause it allowed a system to persist in the United States where
women couldn't vote, they couldn't hold office, if they married they
couldn't hold property in their own name, they couldn't contract for
themselves. That is what life was like for women in the middle of
the 19th century.
  Times changed, and eventually, after nearly a century of strug-
gle, women achieved the vote. They became full citizens. And many
people thought that when women became full citizens, entitled to
the vote, they had achieved equality. The vote should have quali-
fied women as full and equal citizens with men, entitled to the
same equal protection before the laws.
  The position was that, yes, it took bold and dynamic interpreta-
tion in view of what the framers of the 14th amendment intended.
The framers of the 14th amendment meant no change, they in-
tended no change at all in the status of women before the law. But
in 1920, when women achieved the vote, they became full citizens,
and you have to read the Constitution as a whole, changed, as
Thurgood Marshall said, over the years by amendment and by judi-
cial construction. So it was certainly a bold change from the middle
of the 19th century until the 1970's when women's equal citizen-
ship was recognized before the law.
                                      190
  I remain an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment for this
reason. I have a daughter and a granddaughter. I know what the
history was. I would like the legislators of this country and of all
the States to stand up and say we know what that history was in
the 19th century; we want to make a clarion announcement that
women and men are equal before the law, just as every modern
human rights document in the world does, at least since 1970. I
would like to see that statement made just that way in the U.S.
Constitution. But that women are equal citizens and have been
ever since the 19th amendment was passed, I think that is the
case. And that is what the Washington University Law Quarterly
article is about. That is what the second circuit debate was about.
And I do not think my statements should be applied out of context.
This was a precisely focused article about women's entitlement to
equal citizenship before the law.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, I quite agree with you about
the equality principle as a matter of values and have been a spon-
sor of the Equal Rights Amendment for the time that I have been
in the Senate. But I refer to the bold interpretation or your lan-
guage on the alteration of the Constitution as raising the issue of
the appropriate role of the Court because my concern is where we
are going to be in the future. We can see the 21st century on the
horizon. We have had a Constitution which has worked mar-
velously for 200 years, and we have to maintain it. And I know you
are dedicated to that principle.
  But a vital aspect of it is maintaining the appropriate role of
Congress, and part of the language I read you was from your ques-
tionnaire where you limit later the Court's constitutional authority,
but you start on the answer as to judicial activism by saying, "Be-
yond question, a judge has no authority to upset decisions of legis-
lators or executive officials based upon the jurist's own ideas about
enlightened policy or a personal moral view on what content an
ambiguously phrased legal text should have."
  Now, I am concerned about legislating a bit, which is the lan-
guage which you had used in your article in the Cleveland Mar-
shall Law Review. And when you talk about the doctrine of exten-
sion, I wonder why it wouldn't be a sounder course--and you got
into this extensively with Senator Grassley--to do what courts do
in many situations; that is, stay execution of their judgment for 90
days or 180 days, giving the legislative body, the Congress, an op-
portunity to decide whether husbands of servicewomen ought to
have the same benefits as wives of servicemen.
  I certainly would vote for that, but it would make me a great
deal more comfortable so that you don't get involved in legislating
a bit and a movement in the direction which may lead to an imbal-
ance between the Court and the Congress.
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, that technique is necessary
and, as you know very well, has been used in situations like the
Marathon (1982) case, where the Supreme Court upset the ar-
rangement Congress thought it could make with respect to bank-
ruptcy judges. It was used also in a case upsetting a jury system
because it discriminated on the basis of sex, by leaving out women.
I think it was a case from Alabama, it was White v. Crook (1966).
The three-judge Federal district court said we obviously are not
                                      191
going to stop all trials. Instead, we are going to give the legislature
until the next session to come up with a new plan for calling jurors
so that women will not be excluded. In settings like that, where it
takes more than just temporarily putting someone in, or tempo-
rarily putting someone out, your point is essential.

  I mentioned as the model for the decisions the Supreme Court
made in this area Justice Harlan's opinion in Welsh. Justice Har-
lan didn't say, Mr. Welsh, you lose until Congress decides what it
wants to do. I took the position I did as an advocate. It is a position
nine Justices of the Supreme Court explicitly accepted in 1979. It
is an area that is tightly cabined. It reaches only benefits conferred
on one group, but denied to a similarly or identically situated other
group.

  There is a denial of equal protection that the Court has unani-
mously decided must be dealt with one way or another. It is not
like constructing a new system for bankruptcy judges. It is not like
having the clerk gear up to call more people to serve on juries.

  I stand by the Supreme Court's unanimous decision on this point
in Califano v. Westcott (1979), I ask you to read it, and I tell you
that I go no less far and no further than the Court did in that case.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I know the Welsh case and I know Jus-
tice Harlan's concurring opinion, and I would only ask that, as a
matter of deference among branches, that consideration be given to
the stay concept, because you can leave the existing benefits in ef-
fect for a period of time, but I think we have explored it.

  Let me move on to the subject matter of achieving the expanded
women's interest in ways other than through constitutional inter-
pretation, such as through legislation which would look to the rem-
edies and the establishment of the values that we agree on in
terms of having the Congress make the judgments.

  I was interested in a comment made by Catherine MacKinnon
and a group of women's rights activists which have been brought
together by Jeffrey Rosen in an August issue of the New Republic,
commenting that, in the 1980's, and then referring to your work in
the seventies, "A new generation of feminist legal scholars have ar-
gued that the law should emphasize women's differences from men,
rather than their similarities." And Catherine MacKinnon, in the
Buffalo Law Review, in 1985, says, "You can be the same as men,
and then you will be equal, or you can be different from men, and
then you will be women."

  There is a line of contention that more protections are necessary
for women from bans on pornography to child-rearing benefits for
mothers, but not for fathers, not equally for fathers, the greater
protection that women need from child sexual molestation, where
they are more frequently the victims, assaults and battery against
the person, a form of rape or assault with intent to ravish. I would
be interested in your thinking as to use of the legislative branch
as some of the other women's advocates have articulated the views
in the 1980's.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think it is grand to use the legislative branch.
What you discuss, Senator Specter, I think reflects a large
generational difference.

  If the legislative branch really knew what women needed * * *.
The lawmakers thought they did in the days of protective legisla-
192  N

tion. The legislative branch was used extensively, and the legisla-
tive branch said we will restrict the hours for women, but not for
men, we will restrict night work for women, but! not for men, we
will restrict the jobs women can take, but not men, because we
know better, we can protect women; they need to be protected from
unhealthy and unsafe conditions, especially jobs that pay
doubletime and the like.

  The legislature was all over the place protecting women. My gen-
eration of women knew about that style of protection and suspected
it. We had the sense, my generation had the sense, that that old-
style protection was protecting men's jobs from women's competi-
tion.

  So I come to legislative protection of women with a certain skep-
ticism. I do so even today, because, although Senator Moseley-
Braun is sitting there, most of the faces I see are not women's
faces. I suppose if the legislature were filled with women and had
only one or two men, and it was the women's judgment that the
protection Catherine MacKinnon advocated was in order, I might
trust that judgment to a greater extent than I would trust the old-
style protective legislation. All that legislation, and there was a lot
of it, was similar to old-style maternity leave, that said it's unsafe
for you to be working when you are pregnant, so we will take away
your job and send you home. That legislation was not genuinely
protective, although "protection" was the label lawmakers used for
it.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Ginsburg, there are certainly a lot
of efforts made by many of us in the Senate. Senator Biden is a
leader on the protection of women against violence. We do have
more women now. We do listen. I have a very activist wife who is
a Philadelphia City Council member who is the toughest lobbyist
I know, has more access to me. But I am interested in your think-
ing.

  Let me move on to another line, because my time is close to ex-
piring. The issue of law enforcement is a very important one, and
I hope we have time to discuss some of those concepts. My own
view is that we need to curtail the lengthy Federal habeas corpus
proceedings, where the death penalty is not imposed or other pen-
alties are not imposed, because of the deterrent effect of the death
penalty, although I understand there are many people who have
scruples in the other direction.

  Let me ask you a question articulated the way we ask jurors,
whether you have any conscientious scruple against the imposition
of the death penalty?

  Judge GINSBURG. My own view on the death penalty I think is
not relevant to any question I would be asked to decide as a judge.
I will be scrupulous in applying the law on the basis of the Con-
stitution, legislation, and precedent. As I said in my opening re-
marks, my own views and what I would do if I were sitting in the
legislature are not relevant to the job for which you are considering
me, which is the job of a judge. So I would not like to answer that
question, any more than I would like to answer the question of
what choice I would make for myself, what reproductive choice I
would make for myself. It is not relevant to what I would decide
as a judge.
                                      193
  Senator SPECTER. The yellow light is still on, so I will ask you
one more question, Judge Ginsburg. And that is, coming back to
the Equal Rights Amendment--again, I emphasize my own cospon-
sorship and support for it consistently--every Congress since 1923
has considered the Equal Rights Amendment. It was passed by the
House of Representatives in 1971, passed by the Senate in 1972,
but it did not attain the requisite 38 votes for ratification.
  Your writings consistently look to the ERA to solve some of the
problems in adjudicating the interests of women, and my question
to you is: Do you have any concern about an issue of legitimacy for
the Supreme Court to identify new rights in the equal protection
clause, in light of the failure of the passage of ERA, which is the
way identified in the Constitution itself to establish new rights?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, I tried to answer that ques-
tion before. I will try once more. The 14th amendment says that
no State shall deny, neither the United States nor any State shall
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
its laws.
  Before women were full citizens, before they could vote, maybe
one could justify the lack of equal treatment. Ever since the 19th
amendment, women are citizens of equal stature with men. The
Equal Rights Amendment is a very important symbol, in my judg-
ment, because it would explicitly correct the unfortunate history of
the treatment of women as something less than full persons.
  However, the Constitution has been corrected by the 19th
amendment to make women full citizens. I can't imagine anyone
not reading the equal protection clause today to mean that women
and men are persons of equal stature and dignity before the law.
I don't think that is at all an activist position with regard to the
proper interpretation of the equal protection clause of the 14th
amendment.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, what you have just said appears to me
to suggest that we might not need the Equal Rights Amendment.
  Judge GINSBURG. I think Martha Griffiths, when she first sup-
ported the Equal Rights Amendment in a big way in the House,
said if the courts had properly construed the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment, there would be no need for this
Equal Rights Amendment.
  In fact, the first Commission on the Status of Women, which I
think Eleanor Roosevelt headed, was not enthusiastic about the
Equal Rights Amendment. The Commission said it was not needed,
because the courts would come in time to recognize that decisions
holding that the State need not allow women to practice law, the
State need not put women on juries, that those decisions are just
wrong, incompatible with the statement that no State shall deny
to any person the equal protection of the laws.
  So the supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment, even when it
passed Congress--Martha Griffiths and others--made the point
that, if the courts had interpreted the equal protection clause to
cover all of humanity, females as well as males, there would not
have been a need for the amendment.
  As time went on, when the Burger Court began to move in this
area, the need for the amendment lessened in the practical sense.
It still is important, I believe, in the symbolic sense. As I said be-
                                      194

fore, every modern human rights document has a statement that
men and women are equal before the law. Our Constitution doesn't.
I would like to see, for the sake of my daughter and my grand-
daughter and all the daughters who come after, that statement as
part of our fundamental instrument of Government.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Ginsburg. I will
work with you to try to get the Equal Rights Amendment passed.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, the last thing you need is a lawyer, or me,
as your lawyer. But another way of saying what you said, as I have
read all that you have written, I think about everything you have
written, that if there were an Equal Rights Amendment, it clearly
would have ended the debate as to what the 14th amendment
meant. There would be no need to discuss it.
  It is not incompatible with the 14th amendment to extend to
women, as persons, the same rights as men. It would have ended
the debate from the--I was going to say right, but that would not
be correct--it would end the debate from those who suggest it
didn't extend to women. There would be no argumentation left that
they would have even for purposes of political discussion, let alone
outcomes of cases in Federal courts or in the court system. Is that
accurate?
  Judge GINSBURG. That is exactly right, Mr. Chairman, and, on
the legislature's part, it would have been a good way of keeping
cases out of court, cases that should never have had to become Fed-
eral cases.
  The CHAIRMAN. The last point I will make--and I thank the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania for not only mentioning the violence
against women legislation, which I drafted and have been fighting
to get passed for 3 years now, and also being so incredibly helpful
with me in that effort--I want to make it clear that the purpose
of that--and I am going to ask you some questions about it when
my turn comes--is to break down the barriers that continue to
exist in the unequal application of the law.
  A case in point: Police officers need not have someone swear out
a warrant to arrest two people in a fight. If two men are standing
on a corner in a fist fight, the police officer is going to arrest them
both, regardless if either one swears out a complaint. In the vast
majority of cases where a woman is bleeding from an orifice and
a man is standing over her and the police are called, they turn to
the woman and say do you wish to swear out a warrant. And when
she stands there at 110 pounds, looking at a 230-pound man,
knowing that if she says yes, once he gets out on bail he may beat
the living hell out of her again, they demand of her before they ar-
rest, to swear out a warrant. They don't do that with men.
  There are a lot of things that aren't law, but practice. The Vio-
lence Against Women Act is intended to level the playing field. It
is not intended in a paternalistic way to protect our women. That
is not the purpose of it.
  I will get back to that. I just didn't want to let that go in terms
of being compared to other attempts in the past by all-male legisla-
tive bodies to protect women.
                                      195
  Judge GINSBURG. You know the historic origin of the current ab-
sence of genuine protection. She, according to the common law, was
under his wing and cover.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's exactly right.
  Judge GINSBURG. The law assumed that he took good care of her.
He was allowed to beat her, but only mildly.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's right. It was pointed out to me, Judge, as
you well know, in the first hearing I had years ago on this issue.
One of the witnesses looked at me and said, Senator, do you know
where the phrase rule-of-thumb comes from? And I admit I did not
know. She said let me tell you. She said under our English juris-
prudential system, in the common law the woman was property--
I knew that--and a chattel--I understood that. And she said, but
at one point in the development of the common law, we reached a
point where there were too many complaints about men beating
their wives to death and/or crippling them, and so they thought
they had to do something. So the rule adopted by the English
courts was you could beat your wife with a rod, as long as it was
no bigger than the circumference of your thumb. That is real
progress.
  I want to point out one other thing: Senator Moseley-Braun, you
keep wondering why I flew to Chicago and helped unpack your
apartment and move in, and to plead with you to come on this com-
mittee. Can you imagine what the Judge would have said, if both
of you were not on this committee?
  So I am working hard substantively to change it, but also so I
don't get unfairly tarred.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Chairman, I must say that you
once again showed stunning brilliance and insight in making that
invitation at the time. I have been delighted to serve on this com-
mittee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am glad you are, Senator. And I want to
point out, I promised the Senator--excuse me for this digression,
I will yield to my friend from Alabama--I promised the Senator, if
you come on the committee along with Senator Feinstein, there
won't be controversial nominees. The first 29 or so were controver-
sial. But I have kept my promise, we finally have one. OK
  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  First, let me say that we are all delighted to see Senator Specter
back. He looked a little peaked and I can understand why, but his
questioning and his comments were erudite, scholarly and incisive,
as they always have been. He is pretty much his old self, except
he is wearing a cap and we understand why he is having to wear
a cap. But let me warn you that if he comes back on his second
round of questions, you had better be fearful if he is wearing a foot-
ball helmet. [Laughter.]
  I am going to try to get into some issues and things that you
have not been asked about. I think we have gone over a great num-
ber of things, and I have tried to follow the line of questioning and
will attempt to go into some areas that have not been inquired
about.
  You wrote an amazing dissent in the case of "In Re: Sealed Case"
which dealt with the independent counsel law. When it went to the
                                      196
Supreme Court and it came down as Morrison v. Olson, the Court
in its opinion basically adopted your analysis relative to the issue
of whether the Independent Counsel Statute was constitutional or
did violate the separation of powers doctrine.

  I wonder if you would give us some insight into what your think-
ing relative to this issue. It is still an issue that is being discussed
a great deal today and will be an issue that will perhaps be looked
at legislatively again. Would you give us basically your thinking
from a judicial basis relative to the independent counsel law?

  Judge GINSBURG. The independent counsel law was attacked on
the ground that it was an improper derogation from the full au-
thority of the executive branch; the defendant, in the case before
my court, argued that prosecution belonged to the executive branch
and that Congress had improperly curtailed the executive's role in
choosing prosecutors.

  I featured in my dissent in that case two mainstays of our con-
stitutional system: First, separation of powers, and second, temper-
ing the first, checks and balances. Centrally at stake was the prin-
ciple that no person should be judge of his or her own cause. The
independent counsel law provided for the designation of a prosecu-
tor for the highest executive officer, the President, and those who
immediately surrounded that officer. The President and his people
could not be judge of their own cause without sacrificing the ap-
pearance of detachment, and reducing the prospect for a thorough
investigation.

  It would have been a very dangerous thing, a very different
thing, if the legislature had said, President, you are disabled and
we are going to be the prosecutors. The Founding Fathers worried
most about legislative encroachment on other domains. But the leg-
islature enacted a law that did not assign authority to Congress.
The independent counsel law took away some, certainly not all, of
the Executive's authority. The process starts with the Attorney
General, whose responsibility it is to ask for the appointment of an
independent counsel, and there were other safeguards.

  But the appointment authority was placed in the courts. The law
did not present the kind of question that was involved in the chal-
lenge to the Gramm-Rudman Act. In that case, it was an officer al-
lied with the legislature could be seen as encroaching on the Execu-
tive's domain. Independent counsel, however, were to be appointed
by judges. In my view, the legislation responded to a grave concern
on the checking side, and was constitutional on that account. I
thought the law should have been upheld by my court, as it eventu-
ally was by the Supreme Court.

  Senator HEFLIN. Let me ask you about stare decisis. We had
some questions on this, but in the past few terms, the Supreme
Court has sharply been criticized for abandoning certain recently
decided cases. Two examples are both in the area of criminal law.
During the past term, the Supreme Court overruled a 3-year-old
precedent on double jeopardy. In United States v. Dixon, the Court
overturned the 1990 holding in Grady v. Corbin, which held that
the double jeopardy clause barred a second prosecution for any of-
fense based on conduct for which a defendant had already been
prosecuted.
                                      197
  Two terms ago, the Court reversed a 5-year-old precedent in
Payne v. Tennessee,and in its opinion, the majority reasoned that
stare decisis is less vital in cases that don't involve property or con-
tract rights because litigants have not built up reliance on the cur-
rent state of the law.
  In your judgment, is this a sound theory of stare decisis? Would
you prefer some other version such as the test that may have been
hinted at in Dixon, which would inquire into the soundness of the
reasoning in a prior opinion without regard to the substantive area
of the law?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The soundness of the reasoning is certainly a
consideration. But we shouldn't abandon a precedent just because
we think a different solution more rational. Justice Brandeis said
some things are better settled than settled right, especially when
the legislature sits. So if a precedent settles the construction of a
statute, stare decisis means more than attachment to the sound-
ness of the reasoning. Reliance interests are important; the stabil-
ity, certainty, predictability of the law is important. If people know
what the law is, they can make their decisions, set their course in
accordance with that law. So the importance of letting the matter
stay decided means judges should not discard precedent simply be-
cause they later conclude it would have been better to have decided
the case the other way. That is not enough.
  If it is a decision that concerns the Constitution, as did the dou-
ble jeopardy decision you mentioned, then the Court knows the leg-
islature, in many cases, can't come to the rescue. If the judges got
it wrong, it may be that they must provide the correction. But even
in constitutional adjudication, stare decisis is one of the restraints
against a judge infusing his or her own values into the interpreta-
tion of the Constitution.
   Perhaps an apt example of when the Court should overrule a
precedent is Justice Brandeis' decision in Erie v. Tompkins (1938),
which overruled Swift v. Tyson (1842). Brandeis addressed the
question whether the Federal courts could divine and declare gen-
eral common law. The thought originally was that the Federal
courts, being fine courts and knowing a lot about commercial law,
would come up with better rules, and that Federal judgments
would inspire the States and to fall in line.
  But that is not what happened. Instead, you not infrequently had
within the same jurisdiction--the same State--two "common laws."
Which one applied depended on whether you went to Federal court
or the State court. Some lawyers may love that kind of situation
because it gives them choices. But such duality isn't good for a soci-
ety; it generates instability, uncertainty, insecurity.
   One of the things Brandeis said when he overruled Swift v.
Tyson in Erie was that the Swift regime had proved unworkable.
"Is it working" is a major consideration regarding stare decisis.
  Reliance interests did not support retaining Swift because there
was no stable law to rely on. What had been generated was confu-
sion and uncertainty. Private actors didn't know whether the law
governing their transaction would be the law as declared by the
Federal court or the law declared by the State court, until they had
a disagreement and litigation commenced.
                                      198
  So how has a precedent worked in practice? What about reliance
interests? Those things count, as well as the soundness of the deci-
sion. Stare decisis is also important because it keeps judges from
infusing their own value judgments into the law.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, in Erie you have the situation, too, of
where really, in effect, it goes to the 10th amendment in reserving
to the States certain aspects of the law relative to that, as well as
a confusion that might exist with two sets of laws in regards to it.
Do you agree that
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Brandeis said that even though Swift
wasn't working as anticipated, and even though one couldn't justify
retaining the precedent on the basis of reliance, he would hesitate
to overrule. WTiat led him finally to do so was the recognition that
the Federal courts were embarked on an unconstitutional course,
and that was
  Senator HEFLIN. I noticed in your answer you didn't really touch
on the issue of the reasoning that stare decisis is less vital in those
cases involving property or contract law because of the comparison
that in the more commercial field they have built up more of a reli-
ance. Do you have some feeling that criminal law ought to be put
on the same par and on the same equal basis as commercial or
property law?
  Judge GINSBURG. I don't think that reliance is absent from the
criminal law field. Recall that precedent is set for the way the
courts will behave, the way the police will behave, the way prosecu-
tors will behave. One can't say that, in criminal law, reliance
doesn't count.
  Adhering to precedent fosters the stability, the certainty, the
clarity of the law; stare decisis across the board serves those pur-
poses. We have distanced ourselves from the British practice
which, until very recently, so solidly entrenched stare decisis that
the House of Lords, the Law Lords, would not overrule any prece-
dent. That rigidity became unworkable and the Law Lords today
admit some leeway. But stare decisis is a firm principle of our law
and important in all areas.
  Senator HEFLIN. Let me ask you this question. Have you given
any thought to televising court proceedings?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I gave thought to it just the other night
when C-SPAN was replaying a clip of an interview with me taped
some years ago, and I was trying to explain appellate court proce-
dure. And I used many words to convey the picture. One minute
filmed in the courtroom, during the argument of an appeal, would
have been so much clearer than my attempt to explain to an inter-
viewer in chambers how we proceed in the courtroom. Yes, I did
give thought to the matter.
  As you know, Senator Heflin, the Federal courts are just now
embarked on an experiment on a volunteer basis. Some courts have
volunteered, some district courts--trial courts--and some courts of
appeals have volunteered to take part in televising proceedings. A
report will be published evaluating the experiment. Based on that
report, the U.S. Judicial Conference is going to come up with some
proposals for the future.
                                      199
  Some of the judges are apprehensive about who will control the
editing of videotapes, because one can take a snippet out of context
and give the public a false or distorted impression of what goes on.
  The CHAIRMAN. We know the problem.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, of course, I have served on the court, and
we were one of the first States to allow it at the appellate level,
and locating places for cameras where it was not any disruption in
the court proceedings, and our experience was excellent.
  Now, let me ask you about the issue of standing. In the case of
Wright v. Regan, or Reagan, in 1981, you held that the parents of
black children attending public schools had standing to challenge
IRS failure to deny tax-exempt status to private schools that dis-
criminated on the basis of race. The Supreme Court later overruled
you in Allen v. Wright in 1983. Your decision has been cited as
your willingness to be more receptive to citizens' access to our Na-
tion's courts.
  In your various opinions, you have granted standing in cases to
allow a woman's organization to challenge disbursing Federal funds
to educational institutions discriminating against women and to
allow local organizations to bring an action enforcing the Fair
Housing Act. Yet you have denied standing to a trade association
alleging injury for law enforcement of EPA laws in the case of Pe-
trochemical v. EPA and denied standing to copper manufacturers
challenging a Treasury regulation reducing the copper content in
coins in the case of Copper & Brass Fabricatorsv. Treasury Depart-
ment.
  How do you distinguish these cases, and what are your basic no-
tions and principles on the issue of standing?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I believe I followed precedent in every one of
those cases, including Wright v. Regan (1981). It was Regan. The
suit was against the Secretary of the Treasury, not against the
President. Perhaps I should explain why I say that I followed
precedent in face of the Supreme Court's judgment reversing my
decision.
  In Copper & Brass (1982), I wrote a concurring opinion. It was
about the "zone of interest" test. I said I was bound by precedent
to rule as I did, as long as that test governed.
  In Allen v. Wright (1984), I confronted two lines of cases involv-
ing standing. Wright was modeled on a case brought in the 1960's.
That case was called Greenv. Connolly (1971). It involved as plain-
tiffs parents of black school children in the State of Mississippi who
objected to the then Secretary of the Treasury's granting tax-ex-
empt status to private institutions regarded as white-flight schools,
schools whose existence was threatening the implementation of
Brown v. Board.
  The Greencase reached the Supreme Court. The lower court's de-
cision for plaintiffs was affirmed. It was a summary affirmance.
The Court didn't write an opinion. But the affirmance counted as
precedent for the lower courts.
  Wright v. Regan, as 1 remember, was a rather long decision. It
discussed the recent precedent, some of it pointing away from
standing. The strongest "no standing" precedent on point was made
in the Eastern Kentucky WelfareRights Organization (1976) case,
which involved a challenge on the part of poor people to the Treas-
                                                200

ury Department's regulation allowing a hospital to retain its tax-
exempt status even if it didn't provide full care for indigents. The
Supreme Court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in that
case. Eastern Kentucky was argued as the controlling decision for
Wright v. Regan.

  I said there were two relevant lines of cases. One line was indi-
cated by the Eastern Kentucky case. The other line of cases had two
elements. They were about race, and they fell in the area of edu-
cation. Whenever there was the combination of race and education,
in every one of those cases, the Supreme Court had found standing,
most recently in an Alabama case. I think that case arose in Mont-
gomery County.

  I found the two lines of cases in tension. As an intermediate
court judge, I had to pick the line of precedent closest to my case.
Wright v. Regan involved race and education, so it fit with Green
v. Connolly and the race/education cases that followed it.

  The Supreme Court rejected the disparate lines, and said Eastern
Kentucky controlled across the board. That meant "no standing" for
the plaintiffs in Wright. But at the time I wrote, I tried to follow
the precedent as it then existed. The cases on which I relied were
all race/education cases, decisions that up until that point had not
been questioned by the Court itself.

  So my answer regarding those standing cases is that I have tried
to apply precedent faithfully, allowing access to the courts in cases
like Wright v. Regan, but not in the Copper & Brass case, where
the zone of interest test was dispositive. I wrote a concurring opin-
ion, not the main opinion, in Copper & Brass. Even though the cop-
per and brass manufacturers had a very strong economic interest
in keeping up the copper content of the penny, even though they
had an undeniable economic interest and an injury if Congress re-
duced the amount of copper, still they were not within the relevant
"zone of interest." Congress didn't care about the copper manufac-
turers when it passed the regulation saying how much copper ver-
sus how much zinc should be in coins. Congress did not think the
interest of the manufacturers relevant to the congressional deter-
mination of how much of each metal should be in the penny. That
was the Copper & Brass case, and I think Petrochemical was a
similar case.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU commentated, when your announcement as
the nominee came out, frequently said that you would be a consen-
sus builder--I don't think anybody has asked you about this yet--
with the idea that on the court that you have attempted to get
judges together without necessarily affecting their integrity but
moving them towards an institutional approach. And in an article
you have written, you speak about the individualistic approach as
opposed to the institutional approach.

  Would you tell us how you feel or what are the parameters that
you feel should be followed relative to trying to reach a consensus
as opposed to a feeling that you should dissent or you should dis-
agree, even in concurring opinions? This is sort of a nebulous idea,
but I think it is an area we ought to explore a little bit relative
to your thinking on consensus building as opposed to perhaps an
individualistic approach towards decisionmaking.

  Judge GINSBURG. This is an area where style and substance tend
to meet. It helps in building collegiality if you don't take zealous
positions, if you don't write in a overwrought way, if you state your
position logically and without undue passion for whatever is the po-
sition you are developing.
  Think of this way: Suppose one colleague drafts an opinion and
another is of a different view. That other says, "Here's what I
think, perhaps you can incorporate my ideas in your opinion, then
we can come together in a single opinion for the court; otherwise,
consider this a statement I am thinking about making for myself."
That is one way of inviting or encouraging accommodation.
  Another way is to ask, "Is this conflict really necessary?" Perhaps
there is a ground, maybe a procedural ground, on which everyone
can agree, so that the decision can be unanimous, saving the larger
question for another day.
  Willingness to entertain the position of the other person, readi-
ness to rethink one's own views, are important attitudes on a colle-
gial court. If your colleagues, who are intelligent people and de-
serve respect, have a different view, perhaps you should then pause
and rethink, Am I right? Is there a way that we can come together?
Is this a case where it really doesn't matter so much which way
the law goes as long as it is clear?
  Now, with one of the people sitting behind me, I am hesitant to
say this, but let's say a tax provision is at issue. And I think Con-
gress meant x, while my colleague thinks Congress meant y. But
either one will do for the purposes of getting on with the world.
  The CHAIRMAN. Close enough for Government work, right?
[Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. In such a case, I might then say I am going to
squelch my view of how the Internal Revenue Code subsection
should be interpreted and go along with my colleague.
  Senator HEFLIN. I noticed in your article pertaining to this indi-
vidualistic institutional approach that you seem to--from your
knowledge of the internal operations of the Supreme Court, I got
the impression that you feel perhaps that there are too many writ-
ten memorandums and that there is a little too few discussions,
that further discussions might aid in reaching a consensus. I sup-
pose that is based on the fact that if somebody put something in
writing, they have some sort of a pride or a defendership of a writ-
ten document.
  None of us knows exactly what goes on in the Supreme Court,
but I do find that sometimes oral discussions can lead to the con-
sensus rather than a flurry or a great number of written memoran-
dums that might be circulated back and forth.
  Do I interpret that maybe that was something that you were
driving at in your article?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Senator Heflin. I understand the problem.
It is easier to talk among three than it is among nine. I had a les-
son in my own circuit. When we confer after a case is argued, we
have a conference before the judges exchanged written memoran-
dums. We have an immediate, oral conference. I understand that
the practice in the Second Circuit--I came from New York--was
once different. Judges there, at least in the 1970's, exchanged writ-
ten memorandums before coming together to decide the case. And
                                                 202

I considered that way better. If you had to put pencil to paper, you
had to think about the case, get your ideas together.

  But my colleagues' view was different. It was that, just as you
said, if you put something on a circulated paper, you have kind of
committed yourself to it. It becomes a little harder to shake loose
from what you wrote, to retreat, than if the first discussion of the
case, the first encounter, is just in conversation. It is easier to back
off and to modify your position.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, thank you. I am really impressed with
your knowledge of the whole history of jurisprudence. I have wit-
nessed a great number of confirmation processes, but I believe you
show more of a comprehensive knowledge than any other nominee
that I have seen. Maybe we didn't ask all the questions, and maybe
they were at that stage that it wasn't developed certainly in re-
gards to some of the earlier ones. But I congratulate you on your
response and your knowledge relative to the law.

  Thank you.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I thank you for your kind words.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is a good note on which to go to lunch,
Judge.
  [Whereupon, at 1:27 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:30 p.m., this same day.]

                                    AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. Welcome back,
Judge. I hope you had time to have a cup of coffee and a sandwich.

  I-now yield to our distinguished friend from Colorado, Senator
Brown, for his round.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, I look forward to a chance to chat with you,
both now and later on as we go through this. I must say your per-
formance and responses have been impressive, and I appreciate the
candor that you have demonstrated here.
  I wanted to direct your attention to what I think is an interest-
ing development through the years. I suppose every first-year law
student learns quickly that ignorance of the law is no excuse. I am
not sure many schools really explore that. But it struck me as a
very important concept as we go forward, one that perhaps is at
the foundation of our jurisprudence.
  The first case decided by the Supreme Court in which that doc-
trine was applied was Res Publica v. Betsy. It is a 1789 case. As
near as I can tell, it is a reflection of the thinking in our common
law and, before that, the Norman law, and even had foundations
in the Roman law.
  In thinking about the concept, though, that you are responsible
whether you are aware of the law or not, or liable for violating it
whether you are aware of the law or not, it appears that there are
a variety of reasons for it. One is the philosophy that I think was
reflected in our common law that basically laws reflect common
sense, or at least moral mandates; that someone, while they may
not be aware of the statute number, they are aware that murder
or robbery or other crimes are wrong. So that while people may not
be aware of the exact law, they are aware at least of moral man-
dates which guide us in our daily lives.
                                               203

  I suspect another basis for it is simply that it is tough to function
in society without this assumption. It would be tough to get convic-
tions without it.

  But I noticed in the original case, the 1789 case, that at the time
that was ruled, there were only 27 Federal statutes on the books.
Clearly, that is different than our circumstances today. At last
count I think there were some 26,000 pages of the United States
Code, which, of course, excludes State laws. There were 128,900-
some odd pages of the Code of Federal Regulations, and my impres-
sion is that this year the Federal Register will print 70,000 pages
of notices and regulations that are new.

  In doing a quick calculation, if one were conscientious and con-
cerned with their duties as a citizen to know what the law was,
and thus to abide by it, I thought if you read 300 words a minute,
which is a pretty good pace for regulations, 60 minutes an hour
with no breaks, 8 hours a day with no coffee breaks, 5 days a week
with no holidays, 52 weeks a year with no vacations, you would
have read somewhere in the neighborhood of 31,980 pages of the
Federal Register, leaving you well short of half of the new pages
printed every year.

  The CHAIRMAN. Just think how long that hearing would take.
[Laughter.]

  Senator BROWN. I give you this background because I would be
interested in your thoughts as to whether or not it is fair to insist
that ignorance of the law is no excuse, when clearly what was once
accomplishable by a conscientious citizen when that doctrine was
first applied in the United States is beyond even remotely being
possible now.

  Judge GiNSBURG. That question, Senator Brown, should be ad-
dressed first and foremost to people who sit in your forum and not
in mine; that is, you can, in the statutes you pass, write in intent
and knowledge requirements, and you often do. Sometimes courts
have to determine what intent Congress meant, what knowledge
the individual must be shown to have had. Sometimes you do
speak with a clear voice, and judges appreciate it when you do.
Other times we are not clear on exactly what intent requirement
Congress contemplated, and then we do our best to try to deter-
mine what you meant.

  But lawmakers surely should advert to and address the matter.
When they expose individuals to a regulatory regime, they should
be explicit about the intent or knowledge requirement. A difference
based on the consequences may be in order. It is one thing to send
someone to prison for violating a law that person didn't know ex-
isted. It is another simply to subject a person to an injunctive order
requiring compliance with the law. In between those would be some
kind of monetary exaction.

  In this area, courts take their instructions from the legislature,
which has a choice on state-of-mind issues--absolute liability, li-
ability without fault, negligence, knowledge, intent, all that is for
the legislature to say. But every citizen should be mindful that we
are subject to so much more law than we once were.

  Senator BROWN. I appreciate that. Of course, the Romans, when
they looked at this question, they came with a little different view,
I think, than perhaps our common law developed. The Romans rec-
                                                204

ognized that someone in society might have an obligation or the
ability to understand what the laws were, and others who had not
been educated or had other problems would not have the same
level of knowing what the law was ascribed to them.

  I guess my question is not necessarily the wisdom of this body
or of Congress making those decisions. I guess my question is: In
light of the deluge--my own words--of statutes and regulations,
where we as a Congress have assumed that people are aware of the
law, does that trouble you, and do you see any avenues of relief in
the Constitution?

  Judge GINSBURG. Well, one thing is information, and it depends
whether we are talking about the business community or individ-
uals. From time to time, I receive from various law firms in town
newsletters describing the latest developments in labor law or
ERISA law, for example. Such law firms endeavor to keep their cli-
ents informed about new developments in the law.

  In other areas, the flow of information is less satisfactory. We
talked about Stephen Wiesenfeld's case involving the mother's ben-
efit which became a parent benefit. When Wiesenfeld's case was re-
ported in the press, I received many letters, not simply from fa-
thers but from mothers, who didn't know that benefit was avail-
able. The Social Security Administration has tried to increase the
availability of knowledge of what the law is--not only what the law
requires of you, but the benefits the law provides for you.

  Nowadays at funeral homes, at banks, information is accessible
about benefits available on death. But I was disconcerted about the
number of people who didn't know and, therefore, missed out on
benefits because the limitation period for filing had passed.

  We now have modern means of communication to spread infor-
mation. Public service announcements on TV can be useful in that
way. All involved with the law--government officers and private
persons--should attempt to find solutions to the problem of individ-
uals not knowing what the law is, what the law requires of them,
and the benefits provided for them.

  Senator BROWN. I understand that, and I guess my inquiry was
a little more focused in light of 26,000 pages of the United States
Code and 129,000 pages of Federal regulations in force. We can all
understand it is a useful legal fiction if you are a law writer to as-
sume that everyone is assumed to know the law.

  I guess my question is: Does the Constitution afford any protec-
tion against that legal fiction because of the voluminous nature of
the laws, the incredible breadth of laws on the books now, and reg-
ulations on the books? Does the Constitution provide any protection
to citizens that may inadvertently violate a law that they had no
idea existed?

  Judge GINSBURG. I can't answer that question in the abstract. If
it were to come before Court in the guise of a specific case where
a party said the law is exposing me to a penalty, it is unfair, un-
just, it violates due process, I would have the concrete context and
the legal arguments that would be made on one side or the other.
But, again, I would like to emphasize that this Constitution is the
Constitution for the Congress of the United States, and before any
law is passed, every legislator should be satisfied that, in his or her
judgment, the law that has been proposed is compatible with con-
                                                205

stitutional limitations. The Constitution is our fundamental instru-
ment of government, and it is addressed to this body before it is
addressed to the courts. We get it only when a citizen or person
complains that Congress has, in effect, violated the highest law.

  Senator BROWN. I appreciate the nature of your answer and the
limitations, and I suspect one of the reasons we have a Court is
that the Founders of our country knew the limitations of the legis-
lative body, or at least suspected them.

  But are you intrigued with this? I don't mean to bother you with
abstractions, but it strikes me that with the very volume of what
we have attempted to do in the way of regulating, to me it is an
intriguing question that is a difficult one that I think at least
raises substantial issues. I don't mean to put words in your mouth,
but are you troubled by the breadth of what we have attributed to
people in the way of knowledge?

  Judge GINSBURG. And not simply in the way of laws. Think of
what this body puts out, think of the massive regulations put out
by the agencies. Even at the court level, each year the courts
produce more volumes of the Federal Reporter than they did the
year before. There was a day--when I was in law school and, later,
when I was a law clerk--when I skimmed all the Federal advance
sheets, the F.Supp.'s and the F.2d's. That would be impossible for
me to do nowadays. I can just about manage U.S. Law Week each
week.

  Yes, we continue to make more and more law, both in the legisla-
tures and the courts, and the agencies produce more than both of
those put together.

  Senator BROWN. I always suspected that those who came in num-
ber one in their class at Harvard or Columbia did things like that,
but I didn't know. [Laughter.]

  You have attracted some attention by observing with regard to
Roe v. Wade that perhaps a different portion of the Constitution
may well deserve attention with regard to that question; specifi-
cally, if I understand your articles correctly, the equal protection
clause of the Constitution rather than the right to privacy evolving
from the due process right contained in the 14th amendment.

  Would you share with us a description of how your writings draw
a relationship between the right to choose and the equal protection
clause?

  Judge GINSBURG. I will be glad to try, Senator. May I say first
that it has never in my mind been an either/or choice, never one
rather than the other; it has been both. I will try to explain how
my own thinking developed on this issue. It relates to a case in-
volving a woman's choice for birth rather than the termination of
her pregnancy. It is one of the briefs that you have. It is the case
of Captain Susan Struck v. Secretary of Defense (1972). This was
Capt. Susan Struck's story.

  She became pregnant while she was serving in the Air Force in
Vietnam. That was in the early 1970's. She was offered a choice.
She was told she could have an abortion at the base hospital--and
let us remember that in the early 1970's, before Roe v. Wade
(1973), abortion was available on service bases in this country to
members of the service or, more often, dependents of members of
the service.
                                      206
  Capt. Susan Struck said: I do not want an abortion. I want to
bear this child. It is part of my religious faith that I do so. How-
ever, I will use only my accumulated leave time for the childbirth.
I will surrender the child for adoption at birth. I want to remain
in the Air Force. That is my career choice.
  She was told that that was not an option open to her if she
wished to remain in the Air Force. In Captain Struck's case, we ar-
gued three things:
  First, that the applicable Air Force regulations--if you are preg-
nant you are out unless you have an abortion--violated the equal
protection principle, for no man was ordered out of service because
he had been the partner in a conception, no man was ordered out
of service because he was about to become a father.
  Next, then we said that the Government is impeding, without
cause, a woman's choice whether to bear or not to bear a child.
Birth was Captain Struck's personal choice, and the interference
with it was a violation of her liberty, her freedom to choose, guar-
anteed by the due process clause.
  Finally, we said the Air Force was involved in an unnecessary in-
terference with Captain Struck's religious belief.
  So all three strands were involved in Captain Struck's case. The
main emphasis was on her equality as a woman vis-a-vis a man
who was equally responsible for the conception, and on her per-
sonal choice, which the Government said she could not have unless
she gave up her career in the service.
  In that case, all three strands were involved: her equality right,
her right to decide for herself whether she was going to bear the
child, and her religious belief. So it was never an either/or matter,
one rather than the other. It was always recognition that one thing
that conspicuously distinguishes women from men is that only
women become pregnant; and if you subject a woman to disad-
vantageous treatment on the basis of her pregnant status, which
was what was happening to Captain Struck, you would be denying
her equal treatment under the law.
  Now, that argument--that discrimination, disadvantageous
treatment because of pregnancy is indeed sex discrimination--was
something the Supreme Court might have heard in the Struck case,
but the Air Force decided to waive her discharge. Although the Air
Force had won in the trial court and won in the court of appeals,
the Supreme Court had granted certiorari on Captain Struck's peti-
tion. At that point, perhaps with the advice of the Solicitor Gen-
eral, the Air Force decided it would rather switch than fight, and
Captain Struck's discharge was waived. So she remained in the
service, and the Court never heard her case.
  In the case the Court eventually got, one less sympathetic on the
facts, the majority held that discrimination on the basis of preg-
nancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex. Then this body,
the Congress, in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, indicated that
it thought otherwise.
  The Struck brief, which involved a woman's choice for birth,
marks the time when I first thought long and hard about this ques-
tion. At no time did I regard it as an either/or, one pocket or the
other, issue. But I did think about it, first and foremost, as dif-
ferential treatment of the woman, based on her sex.
                                               207

  Senator BROWN. I can see how the equal protection argument
would apply to a policy that interfered with her plan to bear the
child. Could that argument be applied for someone who wished to
have the option of an abortion as well? Does it apply both to the
decision to not have an abortion, as well as the decision to have
an abortion, to terminate the pregnancy?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The argument was, it was her right to decide
either way, her right to decide whether or not to bear a child.

  Senator BROWN. In this case, am I correct in assuming that any
restrictions from her employer to that option, or to that right,
would be constrained by the equal protection clause?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes. In the Struck case, it was a woman's
choice for childbirth, and the Government was inhibiting that
choice. It came at the price of an unwanted discharge from service
to her country. But you asked me about my thinking on equal pro-
tection versus individual autonomy. My answer is that both are im-
plicated. The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to
a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she
must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for
her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human respon-
sible for her own choices.

  Senator BROWN. I also appreciate that you simply presented this
not as the only approach, but as an option that was looked at.

  With regard to the equal protection argument, though, since this
may well confer a right to choose on the woman, or could, would
it also follow that the father would be entitled to a right to choose
in this regard or some rights in this regard?

  Judge GlNSBURG. That was an issue left open in Roe v. Wade
(1973). But if I recall correctly, it was put to rest in Casey (1992).
In that recent decision, the Court dealt with a series of regulations.
It upheld most of them, but it struck down one requiring notice to
the husband. The ruling on that point relates to a matter the chair-
man raised earlier.

  The Casey majority understood that marriage and family life is
not always all we might wish them to be. There are women whose
physical safety, even their lives, would be endangered, if the law
required them to notify their partner. And Casey, which in other
respects has been greeted in some quarters with great distress, an-
swered a significant question, one left open in Roe; Casey held a
State could not require notification to the husband.

  Senator BROWN. I was concerned that if the equal protection ar-
gument were relied on to ensure a right to choose, that looking for
a sex-blind standard in this regard might also then convey rights
in the father to this decision. Do you see that as following logically
from the rights that can be conferred on the mother?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I will rest my answer on the Casey decision,
which recognizes that it is her body, her life, and men, to that ex-
tent, are not similarly situated. They don't bear the child.

  Senator BROWN. SO the rights are not equal in this regard, be-
cause the interests are not equal?

  Judge GINSBURG. It is essential to woman's equality with man
that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling. If you
impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging
her because of her sex.
                                      208
  Consider in this connection the line of cases about procreation.
The importance to an individual of the choice whether to beget or
bear a child has been recognized at least since Skinner v. Okla-
homa (1992). That case involved a State law commanding steriliza-
tion for certain recidivists. Sterilization of a man was at issue in
Skinner, but the importance of procreation to an individual's auton-
omy and dignity was appreciated, and that concern applies to men
as well as women.
  Abortion prohibition by the State, however, controls women and
denies them full autonomy and full equality with men. That was
the idea I tried to express in the lecture to which you referred. The
two strands--equality and autonomy--both figure in the full por-
trayal.
  Recall that Roe was decided in early days. Roe was not preceded
by a string of women's rights cases. Only Reed v. Reed (1971) had
been decided at the time of Roe. Understanding increased over the
years. What seemed initially, as much a doctor's right to freely ex-
ercise his profession as a woman's right, has come to be understood
more as a matter in which the woman is central.
  Senator BROWN. I was just concerned that the use of the equal
protection argument may well lead us to some unexpected conclu-
sions or unexpected rights in the husband.
  You had mentioned earlier, I thought, a very sage observation,
that provisions that, if I remember your words correctly, provisions
that limited opportunities have been sometimes cast benignly as fa-
vors, that we ought to take a new look at these things that are
thought as favors in the past. I think that is a fair comment and
a very keen observation.
  I guess my question is: If you look at these provisions of law that
treat women differently than men and decide that they genuinely
are favorable, not unfavorable, or practices that are favorable, not
unfavorable, does this then mean that they are not barred?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, that sounds like a question Justice
Stevens once asked me at an argument. I said I had not yet seen
a pure favor. Remember, I come from an era during which all the
favors in the end seem to work in reverse. I often quoted the lines
of Sarah Grimke, one of two wonderful sisters from South Carolina,
and they said to legislators in the mid-1900's, I ask no favor for my
sex, all I ask of my brethren is that they take their feet from off
our necks. That is the era in which I grew up. I had not seen a
protection that didn't work in reverse.
  Many of today's young women think the day has come for genu-
inely protective laws and regulations. Were the legislature filled
with women, I might have more faith in that proposition. But, yes,
you can see the difference, you can distinguish the true favor from
the one that is going to have a boomerang effect, maybe so. I re-
serve judgment on that question.
  Senator BROWN. My time is out, but I look forward to chatting
with you again. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. He's going to see if he can think of a favor for
you, Judge.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                      209
  Judge, you are holding up very well in this endurance test that
you are going through. I was pleased when Senator Biden, in his
very first question, when you responded, you used the much ne-
glected ninth amendment to the Constitution. I think it has a great
many implications.
  The ninth amendment, as I am sure you know, came about as
a result of correspondence between Madison and Alexander Hamil-
ton. Madison was persuaded that we should have a Bill of Rights,
and Alexander Hamilton said if you spell out these rights, there
will be people who say these are the only rights that people have,
and so the ninth amendment was added--the enumeration in the
Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or dis-
parage others retained by the people.
  When Senator Leahy asked you about privacy you mentioned the
fourth amendment. I think that privacy is also clearly in the third
amendment.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator SIMON. Troops can't be quartered in your home. I think
it is there by implication in the ninth amendment. But we had a
nominee before us who said, when the ninth amendment says cer-
tain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others re-
tained by the people, that they probably meant by the States, rath-
er than the people. Now, that's a very, very important distinction.
That nominee was not approved by this committee, I might add.
  But when the ninth amendment says "by the people," do you be-
lieve it means by the people?
  Judge GINSBURG. The 10th amendment addresses the powers not
delegated to the United States and says they are reserved to the
States. The 10th amendment deals with the rights reserved to the
States. The ninth amendment--and you have recited the history--
speaks of the people. There was a concern, as you said, that if we
had a Bill of Rights, some rights would surely be left out. There-
fore, it was better, some thought, just to rely on the fact that the
Federal Government was to be a government of enumerated, dele-
gated powers, and leave it at that.
  The ninth amendment is part of the idea that people have rights.
The Bill of Rights keeps the Government from intruding on those
rights. We don't have a complete enumeration in the first 10
amendments, and the ninth amendment so confirms.
  Senator SIMON. SO that there is no misunderstanding, you be-
lieve, when it says "retained by the people," it means retained by
the people?
  Judge GINSBURG. It doesn't mean the States. That's the 10th
amendment, yes.
  Senator SIMON. I would like to also follow through on the public
opinion question that Senator Biden and Senator DeConcini
stressed. In your opening statement, you quote the great Justice
Cardozo as saying justice is not to be taken by storm, she is to be
wooed by slow advances, and a couple of other quotes that we
heard here.
  The Bred Scott decision was probably a very popular decision in
1857. President Buchanan said we have now solved the slavery
problem. But Chief Justice Taney and the others in the majority
made a mistake. In the Korematsu decision regarding Japanese-
                                      210
Americans who were taken from the west coast, you had public
opinion clearly on the side of the President of the United States,
Congress, the military. You had a Lt. Gen. John DeWitt who, in
explaining the need for taking 120,000 Japanese from the west
coast, said the Japanese race is an enemy race, and while many
second- and third-generation Japanese born on U.S. soil possess
U.S. citizenship and have become Americanized, the racial strains
are undiluted.

  Then in one of the most unbelievable nonsequiturs in history, he
said the very fact that no sabotage has taken place to date is a dis-
turbing and confirming indication that such action will be taken.

  What we needed at that time and did not have was a Supreme
Court that said we are willing to stand up to all public opinion.
The gradualist approach simply would not work in the Korematsu
decision, nor could the Court say, well, Congress can change this.

  I am sure you agree the Korematsu decision was a tragic deci-
sion.

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I agree entirely. I think Dred Scott (1857),
by the way, was a tragic decision, a wrong decision. I don't think
it was such a popular decision with a good part of the country that
didn't believe a person who was in a place where he could be free
could be returned to a state of bondage. I don't believe that Dred
Scott was a popular decision throughout the United States.

  Senator SlMON. It was divided opinion, but probably if polls had
been taken at the time, it would have been a popular decision.

  Judge GINSBURG. Korematsu (1944) was indeed a tragic decision.
One of the dissenting Justices called it legalized racism. That
might have a euphemism for what we now recognize that case rep-
resents. Americans of German ancestry and Americans of Italian
ancestry were not treated that way.

  Senator SIMON. But the basic point, and the one that I think by
implication you are suggesting, is that there are times when the
Court has to stand up to public opinion, and it may be 99 percent
of the time on the other side. But the Court has to be courageous
and lead. It cannot sometimes be gradualist in its approach.

  Judge GINSBURG. That was certainly the position Justice Murphy
took. As you know, Justice Black wrote the opinion for the Court.

  Senator SIMON. Hard to believe, but he did.
  Judge GINSBURG. His opinion upheld the racial classification.
  Senator SIMON. Yes.
  Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Pardon me for interrupting,
Senator Simon. There is a rollcall vote on.
  Senator SIMON. OK.
  Senator METZENBAUM. We have 6 minutes to get there. Judge
Ginsburg, I think we will take a 10-minute recess because obvi-
ously everybody else has left for the rollcall vote. I think we had
better do so as well.
  We will recess for a period of 10 minutes.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order, please.
  Let me explain, for those who may be watching this proceeding,
why we all got up and left. There is a debate on the Senate floor
on President Clinton's national service legislation, and Senator
Kennedy is what we call the floor manager of that legislation, re-
                                      211

quired to be on the floor of the Senate during the duration of its
consideration. That is why he is not here, and that is why all of
us got up and went to vote.

  We were not abandoning you, Judge. I know you know this, but
for those who are in the audience, it may be useful for them to un-
derstand why we all started to trickle out of here. I was worried
that some of them who are new to the Senate might think it was
a fire drill and they weren't informed or something.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. It is true.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is true.
  I also want to tell you, as I got up and left--I should do this,
Judge, but as we got up and left, I was heading over in the subway
car with everyone else to vote. Senators Moseley-Braun and Fein-
stein got in the car with me and said, "Now we know what you
think about equal protection." I said, "What do you mean?" She
said, "You got up knowing there was a vote, went to vote, and left
us there." [Laughter.]
  That was not my intention. We were supposed to work this out,
Judge, that half of us would leave so you could continue the ques-
tioning and half would come back.
  But, at any rate, none of that is on your time, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. I thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have 22 minutes and 17 seconds left, and
the floor is yours.
  Senator SIMON. I thank you very, very much, and I will use all
22 minutes and 17 seconds.
  The CHAIRMAN. And more if you need it, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. All right.
  You have been asked by both Senator Metzenbaum and Senator
Leahy about the Lemon test on the question of religion and Gov-
ernment. Through the years, we have had nominees here who have
all been asked and have all given answers one way or another. My
staff checked out four nominees I have asked this question of who
now sit on the Court. One was very critical of the Lemon test, and
he continues to be critical of the test on the Court. One was very
supportive, and he continues to be supportive. One said, "I have no
personal disagreement with the test," but he has voted consistently
in opposition to the Lemon test. And one was not clear, and he has
not been clear since he has been on the Court.
  And I guess I would put you down in the not clear position right
now. Is that an incorrect assumption on my part?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Simon, only to this extent: It is the
governing test, and my approach is the law stays the law unless
and until there is a reason to displace it. So I recognize Lemon v.
Kurtzman (1971) as the governing test. It is the law that is, and
I am not in doubt about that.
  I do know that these are very difficult cases. They come to the
Court with a record, with arguments. I have informed the commit-
tee that I have had only one case involving, on the merits, the es-
tablishment part of the religion clauses. So I am going to devote
very careful thought to the matter. I am going to read a lot more
than I have read up until now. I appreciate the values involved in
making these decisions. More than that, I am not equipped to say.
                                      212
  Senator SIMON. IS it misreading what you are saying to say you
have not had a chance to dig into this as thoroughly as you eventu-
ally will obviously have to, but that on the basis of your limited
knowledge of it, you have no difficulty with the Lemon test now?
Is that incorrect?
  Judge GINSBURG. I think that is an accurate description. It is
also accurate to say I appreciate that the United States is a coun-
try of many religions. We have a pluralistic society, and that is
characteristic of the United States.
  Senator SIMON. And if I could just add, it is not only characteris-
tic, I think it is very, very important that we maintain this. Obvi-
ously there is some working together. When the local Methodist
church is on fire, no one says separation of church and state, we
can't call out the fire department. But we have been careful in
avoiding some of the mistakes that some other countries have
made.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, on my time, because we have gone
through this a number of times, may I ask a question off of the last
question you just asked?
  Senator SlMON. You certainly may.
  The CHAIRMAN. Hopefully it will help clarify rather than confuse.
  The Goldman case to which the Senator referred, the case which
is popularly known by most people as allowing a soldier to wear
a yarmulke while in uniform, you were a dissenting view in the cir-
cuit. Your view on appeal
  Senator COHEN. Mr. Chairman, would you clarify? Disallow the
wearing of
  The CHAIRMAN. In other words, the judge took the position that
a soldier could wear a yarmulke while in uniform, notwithstanding
a military prohibition against such use, she arrived at that decision
using reasoning I will not go into now, but it relates to this ques-
tion.
  Senator COHEN. Was that a majority or minority opinion?
  The CHAIRMAN. Her opinion ended up being the majority opinion
of the Supreme Court
  Judge GINSBURG. I wish it did. It
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I mean, excuse me. Your opinion ended up
being the minority opinion when it hit the Supreme Court, when
it was decided.
  Judge GINSBURG. It was the majority opinion of Congress.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. [Laughter.]
  That is a good way of putting it.
  Senator HATCH. I know.
  The CHAIRMAN. But you reasoned and argued, reasoned in your
opinion when it was before you, that the soldier in question should
be able to, under the free exercise clause--explain the case to me.
[Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. Captain Goldman had been in service for many
years, and one day the base commander said, "You're out of uni-
form," because he was wearing a yarmulke, which was his religious
observance. The failure of the service to accommodate to that devi-
ation from the uniform regulation was made the basis of a case
that came before my court. It came before a three-judge panel. I
was not on that panel.
                                      213
  The panel unanimously ruled that uniform regulations are, by
their very nature, arbitrary and that the courts were not to second-
guess the military in this decision.
  There was then a petition to rehear the case en bane. I voted to
rehear the case en bane. Three people did, but the majority voted
against rehearing the case.
  I did not write a full opinion in the Simcha Goldman (1986) case.
I wrote a statement saying the case should be reheard by the full
court. I said the full court should not embrace the argument that
a uniform is a uniform, so there could be no deviation. The case,
I thought, was worth fuller attention.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you ultimately did not reach a conclusion
whether or not it violated his constitutional right.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I just said we should not leave the final word
for our court with the three-judge panel; we should rehear the case;
the full court should rehear it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would there have been any question in your
mind about the need to rehear it had the Lemon test been in place?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Because this was a free exercise case, it in-
volved the accommodation that the Government would have to
make to the free exercise of Captain Goldman's religion.
  The case fell in the military category. The panel reasoned that
the military setting is different. Many rights people enjoy, includ-
ing free speech rights, are curtailed for members of the military.
  That was the main line of the panel's position in Captain Gold-
man's case. The question ultimately decided by Congress was: In
the interest of allowing Captain Goldman to freely exercise his reli-
gion, could the military be called upon to make this accommodation
to him? Congress realized the free exercise right more fully than
the courts did in that instance, and that issue, I think, is now well
settled.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SlMON. Of course, Mr. Chairman. If I might just add, I
spoke on the floor on that issue. The question is: In addition to the
fundamental religious question, the free exercise question, does it
in any way impair the military? It has not impaired the Israeli
military. The Indian Army has Sikhs who wear a different head-
dress. They are among the finest members of the military of India.
So that on a military ground, also, it did not have much validity.
  If I may shift to a totally different subject so I get a little more
of an understanding of where you are, in your opening statement
you accurately described Judge Learned Hand as one of the world's
greatest jurists. No other non-Supreme Court member has had as
much influence in the history of our country as Judge Learned
Hand. You had one unhappy experience with him, but you had the
privilege of meeting him and knowing him--slightly, anyway. I
wish I could have had that experience.
  What made Judge Learned Hand such a distinguished jurist?
  Judge GlNSBURG. His tremendous learning, his facility with the
English language so that he could describe things so extraor-
dinarily well; his great love of the law as a craft; his genuine caring
about people. Some people think he was too restrained and mod-
erate in his judging, but he believed in the people and in the im-
portance of keeping liberty alive in the hearts of men and women.
                                      214
  It is unfortunate that he had a blind spot, that he felt uncomfort-
able about dealing with a woman as a law clerk. I think you have
heard the story of my acquaintance with Judge Hand.
  Senator SIMON. I did. That is what I was referring to.
  Judge GINSBURG. But he was a man of a different age. He had
been brought up not to relate to women in that kind of setting. I
have told the story many times of sitting in the back of the car
when my judge drove Judge Learned Hand home. That great man
would say, en route home, anything that came into his mind. He
would sing songs with words I didn't even know. I once said to him,
"How can you carry on this way with me in the car and yet not
consider me to be your law clerk?" And he said words to this effect:
"Young lady, I am not looking you in the face."
  Those were ancient days. There was no title VII, people were up
front about feeling uncomfortable dealing with women, and that
was that.
  Senator SIMON. One other aspect that you did not--and I agree
with everything you said about Judge Learned Hand. I think the
other aspect is he was a great champion of civil liberties.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, he was, and his decision in the Masses
(1917) case was one of the bright lights in what we see now as a
very unhappy episode in the history of this country--the post-
World War II days of the Red scare.
  Senator SIMON. If you were to pick a role model on the Court,
living or dead, what role model or composite role model would it
be?
  Judge GINSBURG. I will stay away from the living.
  Senator SlMON. All right. [Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. We are just now doing a history of our Court,
a circuit history. A question came up about talking to law clerks
for this history. We drew a line with the living. We said to the au-
thor, you may talk to the law clerks about the judges who can't
complain about it anymore, but not clerks who served the living,
at least not without the judge's permission.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is one of the incredible values of life tenure.
[Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. I would also like to restrict my response to this
century. That will make it easier, because if I didn't I would have
to include Chief Justice John Marshall; he helped make us one Na-
tion, indivisible. If we go on to liberty and justice for all, I would
put together two people who spoke originally in dissent but whose
position on the first amendment is well accepted today, Brandeis
and Holmes.
  I would like to include Cardozo, but as you know, his career was
principally on the New York Court of Appeals. He was known for
his common law judging, and less known for constitutional adju-
dication. He served only 6 years on the Supreme Court.
  I would add to the list Justice Harlan because, as I explained be-
fore, of the judges in my time, there is no one--whether you agree
with him or disagree with him--who was more honest in telling
you the grounds of his decision, the competing interests, and why
he came out the way he did. I spoke of his total honesty in my dis-
cussion of the conscientious objector case.
                                      215

  So if I could take those three and put them together, that would
be some Justice, wouldn't it?

  Senator SlMON. It would be. And I would like to add Learned
Hand to that list, if I could, aside from that

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes; I thought we were limiting it to Supreme
Court Justices, but certainly yes. I would like to put Henry Friend-
ly there, too.

  Senator SlMON. You have been a champion of the cause of women
and civil liberties for women, and Senator Grassley earlier men-
tioned that in our laws we have finally included Congress which
has set up its own provisions for enforcement of antidiscrimination.
There are problems, and under the separation of powers I think it
is proper for Congress to set up its own.

  I serve on the Subcommittee on Disabilities, and my colleague,
Senator Tom Harkin, has written me a letter, and let me just read
two paragraphs from that letter. And I would like to enter the full
letter in the record, Mr. Chairman.

  It says:

   Unfortunately, no Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability
or, for that matter, race, gender, religion, or national origin by our Federal courts.
It is my understanding that our Federal district and appellate courts have devel-
oped model policies regarding complaints of discrimination by applicants and em-
ployees. However, these policies do not specify the standards that must be used to
determine whether discrimination has occurred, do not specify what remedies are
available, assuming discrimination has been found, and do not include the right to
appeal to the courts. Furthermore, there are no policies governing nondiscrimination
with respect to access by the general public.

   With respect to the Supreme Court, it is my understanding that there are no writ-
ten policies or procedures whatsoever prohibiting discrimination in employment and
in access to Supreme Court proceedings and for remedying discrimination.

  [The letter of Senator Harkin follows:]

                                                                                                  U.S. SENATE,
                                                  COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES,

                                                                Washington, DC, July 14, 1993.

Hon. PAUL SIMON,

U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.
   DEAR PAUL: Over the years, we have worked together to broaden the civil rights

and expand opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Section 504 of the Reha-
bilitation Act of 1973 (which, among other things, prohibits discrimination by Fed-
eral agencies in the conduct of their business) and the Americans with Disabilities
Act are two of the most important pieces of legislation impacting on the lives of peo-
ple with disabilities.

   Unfortunately, no Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability
(or for that matter race, gender, religion, or national origin) by our Federal courts.
It is my understanding that our Federal district and appellate courts have devel-
oped model policies regarding complaints of discrimination by applicants and em-
ployees. However, these policies: do not specify the standards that must be used to
determine whether discrimination has occurred; do not specify what remedies are
available assuming discrimination has been found; and do not include the right to
appeal to the courts. Furthermore, there are no policies governing nondiscrimination
with respect to access by the general public.

   With respect to the Supreme Court, it is my understanding that there are no writ-
ten policies or procedures whatsoever prohibiting discrimination in employment and
access to Supreme Court proceedings and for remedying discrimination.

   I request that when Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg comes before the Judiciary Com-
mittee next week regarding her nomination to serve as an associate Justice on the
U.S. Supreme Court, you inform her about this situation and ask her what she will
do to address it, if confirmed by the Senate.

        Sincerely,
                                                                              TOM HARKIN, U.S. Senator.

                                      216

  Senator SIMON. NOW, I don't want to ask you to turn things
around overnight. I would like to get any observations you have on
this, and I would like to, 6 months from now, send a letter to the
new Justice of the Supreme Court and ask her her response at that
point and what you feel at that point maybe could or should be
done.

  Judge GINSBURG. I don't know what the Supreme Court regula-
tions are. I do know that the Supreme Court in many respects has
been treated differently by Congress. For example, I participated in
the decision of a case involving picketing at the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court was not covered by the law that covered the
rest of the Federal courts. The case was called Grace v. Burger
(1985).

  The decision, both in our court and the Supreme Court, upheld
the first amendment claim of a woman who was standing, if I re-
member correctly, on the sidewalk in front of the Court carrying
a sign that had the words of the first amendment written on it. She
was removed for doing that.

  I can't speak about what the Supreme Court's own rules are now.
But, as you have said, Congress has accepted fair employment
practices standards for itself. I hope, if we meet 6 months from
now, I will be informed on the subject of your inquiry and can give
you an enlightened answer.

  Senator SlMON. And it does seem to me that not only the Su-
preme Court, but the lower courts ought to have some process by
which, if a person feels that he or she has been aggrieved, that he
or she can go to someone and know that there is some process es-
tablished, some procedures established at all court levels. I will
write to you, if my staff reminds me, 6 months from now.

  Senator LEAHY. I will.
  Senator SlMON. Senator Leahy will remind me.
  I was pleased in reading your background about, first of all, the
fact that you have gone through some things that have been tough,
so that you understand the problems that people who face difficul-
ties have, particularly your statement yesterday of riding along as
a child and you saw the sign "no dogs or Jews," and your work in
a social security office in Oklahoma, where you had to deal with
the problems that the American Indians had.
  Theodore Roosevelt, in a 1913 speech--this is after he had been
President--said this:

  Our judges have been, on the whole, both able and upright public servants, but
their whole training and the aloofness of their position on the bench prevent their
having, as a rule, any real knowledge of or understanding sympathy with the lives
and needs of the ordinary hard-working toiler.

  I think that is a danger for jurists, and probably no place is at
a greater danger than on the U.S. Supreme Court, where you really
are isolated, and where, when you meet people, they will tend to
be people of power and wealth, and not people who are unem-
ployed, not people who have many of the problems that Americans
face. Have you reflected on this at all, either in your present tenure
or future tenure? How can this nominee make sure that she stays
in touch with the real problems people have out there?

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Senator, I have and I know just what you
mean. You can even see the difference between the Federal court
                                      217

on which I serve and the courts across the street. The U.S. Court-
house tends to be a rather quiet, empty place. If you go across the
street to the District of Columbia Superior Court, you will see a
great mass of people--all kinds of legal business, all kinds of prob-
lems, including heart-rending family problems. The place is teem-
ing; it is quite a contrast to the quieter halls of the Federal court.

  One of the things that I have done every other year with my law
clerks, more often, if they are so inclined, is to visit the local jail
and Lorton Penitentiary, which is the nearest penitentiary. We vis-
ited St. Elizabeth's, the facility for the criminally insane, when it
was a Federal facility. Now it is a District facility, so we haven't
gone there in the past few years.

  I do that to expose myself to those conditions, and also for my
law clerks. Most of them will go on to practice in large law firms
specializing in corporate business, and won't see the law as it af-
fects most people. That is one of the things I do to stay in touch.

  Senator SlMON. I would simply commend that practice, first of
all. And as you prepare to take that oath and when you get to-
gether with your family--your son from Illinois, particularly--I
hope that you in some way plan to continue that kind of an expo-
sure. I think it is important. I think it is important for the mem-
bers of the U.S. Senate. I think it is important for Supreme Court
Justices.

  Judge GINSBURG. It took me a long time to arrange for a tour at
Alderson, which is one of the nearest women's Federal facilities.
That was also instructive and moving for me.

  Senator SlMON. There are people who will have to assist you in
that, because of the nature of your new position, but I think it is
something that is a desirable thing.

  In the case of O'Donnell ConstructionCo. v. District ofColumbia,
you voted against a set-aside, and that was done, as I understand
it, on the basis of the Croson decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Croson decision has resulted in significant damage to opportu-
nities for a lot of minorities and women in the field of business. We
have come a long way in providing opportunities, but we still have
a long way to go, as you know.

  I had my staff dig out something from one of my books. Abraham
Lincoln, incidentally, as a State legislator in 1832, came out for the
women's right to vote almost a century before that happened na-
tionally. But when he was in the legislature, one of the bills
passed, fairly typical, was the act for the Wabash and Mississippi
Railroad which included this provision:

  In case any married woman, infant, idiot or insane person shall be interested in
any such land or real state, the circuit court or justice of the peace shall appoint
some competent and suitable person to act for and in behalf of such married woman,
infant, insane person or idiot.

  We have made progress, but we still have progress to make. I
was interested in your decision in the O'Donnell case, whether that
is solely based on response to the Supreme Court, or is there a
philosophical base to your decision also?

  Judge GINSBURG. I concurred in a decision that was written for
a unanimous panel. I think the author was Judge Randolph. Our
decision was controlled by Croson (1989). The District's plan meas-
ured up even less than the Richmond plan did in Crosonitself. As
                                      218
you know, under current law, a different standard applies to Fed-
eral plans; it is a more tolerant standard than the one that applies
to city plans like the Richmond plan.

  Crosongoverns city plans, and MetropolitanBroadcasting (1990)
governs Federal plans. There is certainly a role for Congress to
play in this.

  My concurring statement said Croson controls this case. I also re-
called, in that separate statement, the position Justice Powell had
taken in the Bakke (1978) case. He said that you could have a rea-
son for an affirmative action program, for example, Harvard's pref-
erential admissions program, that was not tied explicitly to proven
past discrimination. But the O'Donnell (1992) case in our court did
not fit that mold. It was a case totally controlled by the Croson
precedent.

  Senator SlMON. The second part of my question is, Do you have
a philosophical disagreement with the idea of set-asides?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I tried to express my view yesterday that, in
many of these cases, there really is underlying discrimination. But
it's not so easy to prove. Sometimes it would be better for society
if we didn't push people to the wall and make them say, yes, I was
a discriminator. The kind of settlement reflected in many affirma-
tive action plans seems a better, healthier course for society than
one that turns every case into a fierce, adversary contest that be-
comes costly and bitter.

  In many of these plans, there is a suspicion that underlying dis-
crimination existed on the part of the employer and, sometimes, on
the part of the unions involved. But, in place of a knock-down-drag-
out fight, it might be better to pursue voluntary action, always tak-
ing into account that there is a countervailing interest, as there
was in the O'Donnell case. Members of the once preferred class un-
derstandably ask, "why me," why should I be the one made to pay?
I didn't engage in past discrimination. That's why these cases must
be approached with understanding and with care.

  I hope that is an adequate answer to your question.
  Senator SlMON. Really candidly, it wasn't all I was hoping for,
but I am getting your response and I appreciate that.
  My time is up, and I thank you very much, Judge.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Cohen
  Senator COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, during one of the breaks earlier today, I threw
caution to the wind and agreed to go on a television program to
comment on the proceedings that we are now conducting. I will be
careful how I phrase this, because they are still covering me right
now.
  Two of the journalists indicated that there were several key
points involved in these hearings. No. 1, Senators weren't as
knowledgeable as Judge Ginsburg on constitutional decisions. No.
2, we weren't as prepared to followup your answers with an analy-
sis of your judicial thought process. No. 3, we were too busy with
other responsibilities and we were relying primarily upon our
staffs. No. 4, we do not seem as passionate as a committee about
your nomination as, say, the committee was during the Robert
Bork hearings or those of Judge Clarence Thomas. No. 5, you man-
                                      219
aged to deflect or, put more roughly, duck questions that might
provide some insight into your thought process, because of the pos-
sibility, however remote, that those issues might come before the
Court at some future, but indefinite time.

  I pled guilty to all charges that were made, noting that there
were several members of this committee who were expert in the
field of constitutional law.

  Nonetheless, it seems to me it called into sharp focus exactly why
we are here, what is the purpose of this committee in its advice
and consent role. We are supposed to determine whether you have
the intelligence and the competence and the temperament to serve
on the Supreme Court, and I think there is very little disagreement
among the members of this committee that you have all of the req-
uisites.

  The additional question that we are seeking to probe is that of
your judicial philosophy. Senator Biden indicated we crossed that
line finally in this process of confirmation in looking at a judge's
or a nominee's philosophy.

  But even that examination of philosophy is not without its limits.
For example, it is not incumbent upon you to agree with my inter-
pretation of a law or what I think the law should be, or that of any
other member. What I think we are trying to do, and are only real-
ly qualified to do, is to examine your philosophy to determine
whether we find it so extreme that it might call into question those
other requisites that I mentioned before. Barring that, I don't be-
lieve that the philosophical issue is one that would be appropriate
for the committee. That is my personal view.

  There are a number of reasons, in my judgment, why there are
no fireworks in this hearing, and why the members may seem to
be less prepared than they were, let's say, during Judge Bork's con-
firmation hearings, and perhaps those of Justice Thomas.

  No. 1, your record as a jurist is not perceived to be outside the
mainstream of current jurisprudence. That in my judgment is a
major factor. There might be a different view, I would submit to
you, if you had been nominated immediately following your string
of victories before the Supreme Court in arguing on behalf of the
expansion of equal protection. There might have been quite a bit
of controversy on this committee at that time, because you might
have been perceived as a political activist who would bring those
activities to the Court.

  Two things have intervened: No. 1, time, during which the Amer-
ican people have caught up to your views and now accept them as
what we should have assumed would have been the law all along;
and, No. 2, your service on the Court where you practice restraint,
instead of pursuing a political agenda.

  The reason that so many of the members have dwelled on the
issue of whether you might do the right thing--you were citing
Justice Marshall in the Worcester v. Georgia case--is that there is
suspicion in some circles, at least, that you are basically a political
activist who has been hiding in the restrictive robes of an appellate
judge, and that those restrictions will be cast aside and you will
don a much larger garment. There is fear and apprehension on the
part of some that that might be the case, and there is the hope on
the part of some that that is precisely what you will do.
                                                220

  So for all of those reasons, we are trying to probe exactly where
it is you would likely take yourself and perhaps even the Court on
any given decision.

  I was struck by your comment in response to Senator Biden yes-
terday. You said every Justice and judge should do what he or she
believes to be legally right. I looked over at Senator Biden and he
was smiling, and he said, "You're good, Judge, you're real good." I
jotted a note that said "delphic ambiguity."

  I am sure you are familiar with Greek mythology about the
delphic oracle, where people would go to this cave and they would
ask the mouth of the cave a question, and the answer would come
back, to be interpreted by the listener to whatever he or she want-
ed to hear at that time. I can recall one classic case where a leader
of an army went to the delphic oracle and said, "Tell me what will
happen if I invade Greece or a province tomorrow." And the answer
came back, "If you invade tomorrow, a great army will fall."
Buoyed by that, he went back, got his troops together and went in
and got massacred. A great army did fall, his army.

  So we have come to see those kinds of responses as perhaps
delphic in their ambiguity.

  It also struck me that the response that every judge should do
what he or she believes to be legally right is something of a So-
cratic exercise. I thought of the Socratic dialog in which the ques-
tion is posed, Is beauty pleasing to the gods because it is good, or
is it good because it is pleasing to the gods?

  In this particular case, I would ask, Is it the right thing because
it pleases the Court, or does it please the Court because it is the
right thing?

  That is the kind of Socratic question that we are trying to resolve
here. In the absence of established precedent, is what the Court be-
lieves to be the right thing based upon what is morally right or
what it perceives to be socially right?

  Judge GINSBURG. I have yet to see the case where the Court has
nothing to guide it, where there is that kind of blank. There is al-
ways the text that we are interpreting. The text comes in a certain
setting. There is in this day and age an abundance of case law and
commentary.

  I have not seen a case where the Court totally lacks way pavers.
  Senator COHEN. Aren't there always questions where you call it
a first impression?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes; that means the precise case hasn't been
decided by the Court. But there are, almost always analogies. I
have not seen a case without analogies. And there are often choices
to be made. I described one when I spoke of Wright v. Regan
(1981), where there were two lines of precedent; the case, the par-
ticular case, could have been placed in either category. We placed
it in one category. The Supreme Court said we were wrong; it be-
longed in the other.
  There are those kinds of choices. But I think every judge in this
system is committed to the health and welfare of the Federal
courts. When one compares to other systems what we have and the
high position of our Supreme Court--a position unique in the
world--the value of our system becomes clear, and we want to keep
the system safe.
                                         221

  Senator COHEN. All right. Let me rephrase it a bit. Senator
Biden asked you under what circumstances it would be appropriate
to do the right thing; that is, to step out in front of the political
process or perhaps even, indeed, public opinion. We can go back
and look at the Brown case in which you felt there was a sufficient
legal foundation for the Court to have stepped out, at least a little
bit, in front of public opinion at that time.

  There is the Roe decision in which I think you felt, in writing
your analysis of that particular case, that there was an insufficient
foundation, at least politically, to support that decision and that
the Court might have reached a different result or perhaps the
same result under a different rationale.

  These are two cases where they stepped out in front to make a
rather bold decision.

  The question I have is: What if you have public opinion polls
which delineate a fairly stable body of public opinion and Congress
has taken either no action or has passed a law which you perceive
to be inconsistent with public opinion? What would be your role as
a Supreme Court Justice in doing the right thing under those cir-
cumstances?

   Judge GlNSBURG. If Congress has passed a law inconsistent with
public opinion, then the public will react to it one way or another,
and either accept it or not accept it. That is what legislatures

   Senator COHEN. NO; I am asking it a different way. I am asking
what if you have a situation in which Congress has taken no action
in this area but public opinion polls show that there is a fairly solid
majority in favor of a particular social objective. Congress has ei-
ther taken no action or, in fact, passes an act which is inconsistent
with what is perceived to be a solid body of public opinion. What
do you believe the role of the Court should be under those cir-
cumstances?

   Judge GlNSBURG. We do not have a tricameral system. The
courts don't react to public opinion polls. They do react to what
Professor Freund described as, not the weather of the day, but the
climate of the age. I tried to explain that when I talked about the
19th amendment and the 14th amendment.

   Senator COHEN. Let me go ahead and quote what you did write,
and perhaps you can clarify it for me. You indicated that you ap-
prove of a change in constitutional interpretation that has been
brought about by a "growing comprehension by a jurist of a perva-
sive change in society at large."

   So you believe the Court should acknowledge a pervasive change
in society at large in reaching a constitutional decision.

   What I am asking you is: What if society at large is ahead of the
legislative branch?

   Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Cohen, I must ask you to place the
statement that you read in context. It was made in a very specific
context. The point was that, at last, the country had come to appre-
ciate that women were full and equal citizens with men; that the
perception of women's place that marked the 19th century and the
18th century had become obsolete; that when the 19th amendment
gave women the right to vote, they became full and equal citizens
entitled to the same protection men had under the 14th amend-
ment.
                                                222

  I was speaking in that context. I was not addressing a grand,
philosophical concept that would apply across the board. I spoke
specifically and only of the growing understanding of society that
women were equal citizens. That is the point I made in the writing
to which you referred.

  Senator COHEN. Right, but the language, I would assume, would
apply to other situations as well, would it not? If there is a growing
comprehension by that jurist of a pervasive change in society at
large, that in your judgment would at least argue for or, indeed,
perhaps even compel the Court to recognize that change, even in
the absence of a statute or perhaps even in opposition to a statute,
would it not?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I have spoken in the context of gender
equality. There are other contexts in which people are making
claims and will be making claims that will come before the Federal
courts. I cannot say anything more than I have already said on
that subject.

  Senator COHEN. In other words, should I just take that argument
and confine it only to the equality of women under the 14th amend-
ment?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Take what I wrote and appreciate that I be-
lieve it would be injudicious of me to speak now about the many
classifications that could come before the Court. May I recall what
I said in my opening remarks, that I do not want to offer here any
hints on matters I have not already addressed.

  Senator COHEN. All right.
  Judge GlNSBURG. To avoid prejudgment, I must draw the line
where I did.
  Senator COHEN. Let me go on. I take it you do believe that the
Equal Rights Amendment is still necessary to provide an explicit
constitutional guarantee of equal protection for women. Do you still
believe that?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have said that I think the Equal Rights
Amendment is an important symbol. Our Constitution has survived
for over 200 years with very few amendments. I appreciate that,
and would like to keep it that way.
  On the other hand, I do think that at the end of this century,
the Equal Rights Amendment would be, even if only symbolic, an
important symbol to add explicitly to the Constitution, because I
would like the statement the amendment makes to be clear to
every grade school child.
  Senator COHEN. Let me explain to you why I am asking this
question so you won't take offense that I might be quoting some-
thing out of context. My understanding is you have written that
you believe the Equal Rights Amendment is necessary to provide
an explicit constitutional guarantee of equal protection for women,
that the Supreme Court has used what you call creative interpreta-
tions to accommodate a modern vision of sexual equality, and that
such interpretation, however, has limits, but sensibly approached,
it is consistent with the grand design of the Framers. I believe that
is a pretty close paraphrase of what you have written.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. The question I have is: What are the limits that
you believe are still in place? And would you wait for Congress to
                                               223

eliminate those limits, or would you engage in creative interpreta-
tion to achieve the elimination of the limits?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I must return to my plea for understanding
that a judge works from the particular to the general.

  Senator COHEN. What are the limits you see that the Court has
imposed in not granting full recognition to equal rights for women
through this process of creative interpretation?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I don't think that the Court has imposed limits.
The Court takes these matters case by case. In the most recent
cases the Court struck down a gender classification. It said the
standard of review is still open; the Court has not rejected the most
stringent standard of review for gender-based classifications.

  But I do want to clarify. I appreciate the compliment that you
paid me, but you must understand how unfamiliar this milieu is
to me. I haven't done anything as a teacher or an advocate without
tremendous preparation, without a written outline or brief, without
notes for oral argument. I never taught a class without hours of
preparation, at least 4 hours for every 1 hour I spent in the class-
room. So this milieu is much more familiar to you

  Senator COHEN. In other words, you would rather be up here
asking us those questions, right? [Laughter.]

  Judge GlNSBURG. This questioning is a very healthy exercise, be-
cause you are making an indelible impression on me of what it is
like to sit down here, on the receiving end and how much easier
it is to ask the questions than to answer them.

  Senator COHEN. I hope you will reciprocate in the event that any
of us, when we leave this place, come before you and you are sit-
ting on the Court. [Laughter.]

  In any event, I would like to move on
  The CHAIRMAN. AS counsel, he means. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Not a defendant. Right. I just hope you won't re-
ciprocate under some circumstances.
  Senator COHEN. Judge Ginsburg, you were quoting, I believe,
Judge Irving Goldberg yesterday. You quoted him as saying that
the Court or judges were like fire fighters putting out fires that
they didn't start. Some would argue that the Supreme Court from
time to time has, in fact, started fires that might have remained
either unignited or been smothered through what I would call su-
preme silence.
  But assume that fire of controversy is now before you. I would
like to know how you view congressional intent.
  There are jurists who argue that the Court should disregard the
tradition of looking to the legislative history of a law to determine
how Congress intended that it be executed, and under this view
they should look to the language in the four corners of the statute
to resolve any ambiguities and not to committee reports, floor
speeches, or any other items that might accompany a bill through
the legislative process.
  Now, the proponents argue, as one has said, that "judicial abdi-
cation to a fictitious legislative intent" would occur were you to
look for congressional intent, and that legislative history itself is
"the last hope of lost interpretive causes."
  Do you agree with that statement?
                                                224

  Judge GINSBURG. It would be wonderful, Senator, if you wrote
the laws so clearly that we knew what your intent was imme-
diately on reading them. Our job is to interpret the laws as the leg-
islature meant them to be interpreted. Best of all possible worlds
for us would be that you speak clearly, you leave no doubt, and we
can just read the text and say no reasonable person can disagree
about its meaning.

  But very often, my colleagues will look at a text, and one reason-
able mind will say it means x while another reasonable mind will
say it means y. We must then look someplace else.

  In such cases, I turn to the legislative history. I do so with an
attitude I can best describe as hopeful skepticism. Hopeful because
I really hope I will find something genuinely helpful there and that
everything will be on line, the committee report and any other
statements made. It would be grand if they all coincide.

  Senator COHEN. What happens when you find legislative ambigu-
ity? Do you look to the statements of committee chairmen, the
managers of the bill? Do you look to the majority and minority
leaders? Do you look to language in the committee reports? Do you
give any priority in that hierarchy of words that might be found
in a legislative history, assuming there is ambiguity?

  Judge GINSBURG. Not rigidly. I can say as a general rule, if you
have a unanimous committee report, that is going to be more use-
ful, more reliable, than a statement made by a member of the
chamber after the bill has passed. The statement of a single legis-
lator generally would count for less.

  But I can't give you a definitive account and say it is always the
committee report or it is always the statement of the sponsor that
comes first. A very fine judge of my court, Judge Harold Leventhal,
once said that visiting legislative history is like going to a cocktail
party and looking through the crowd for your friends. There are
some very recent situations in which the legislative history is so
crammed that a statement saying the law means one thing can be
matched by a statement saying it means something else.

  So, yes, one must decide the case. A judge must decide what the
legislature mean. If she can't tell from the words of the statute, she
must resort to our sources of help. Sometimes a judge can reason
by analogy. Perhaps a similar statute was passed that has a clear-
er statement either in the text or the history of that statute. But,
yes, I do look at legislative history when the text is not clear, and
I approach it with an attitude of hopeful skepticism.

  Senator COHEN. I raise the issue because, No. 1, you have testi-
fied before this committee in the past, I believe in 1985, in opposi-
tion to the creation of a Federal intercircuit panel that would re-
solve the differences in statutory interpretation among the circuit
courts. Another reason I raise the issue is that the Supreme Court
traditionally upholds the executive branch's interpretation of a law
unless there is a contrary congressional intent that has been estab-
lished. That became of particular importance to us in the Rust v.
Sullivan case in which the Supreme Court in a 5-to-4 decision
upheld the Reagan administration's regulation that prohibited the
grant recipients of title X family planning funds from providing
counseling and referral or services on abortion. It seems to me it
                                                225

was a reversal of longstanding tradition to achieve that particular
end.

  For the benefit of my colleagues, the language that I quoted ear-
lier, about judicial abdication to a fictitious legislative intent, that
was Justice Scalia who articulated that position.

  Judge GINSBURG. I am well aware of his position.
  Senator COHEN. Let me turn, if I can, to the issue of free speech.
The case involved the Community for Creative Nonviolence or
CCNV v. Watt. Do you remember that case?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I do, that was the sleeping in the park
case.
  Senator COHEN. Yes, the sleeping in the park case. It is not the
same as "Sleeping in Seattle," but sleeping over in Lafayette Park.
  Judge GINSBURG. "Sleepless in Seattle."
  Senator COHEN. YOU saw the movie?
  Judge GINSBURG. I did, yes. [Laughter.]
  I don't get to see many movies, but I did get to see that one.
  Senator COHEN. YOU enjoyed it, as well.
  Judge GINSBURG. I did, especially the music.
  Senator COHEN. Do you have the sound track to the music?
[Laughter.]
  Let me come back to the issue of conduct and speech. We have
a somewhat ironic situation where conduct can in fact be inter-
preted as speech protected by the first amendment. For example,
we know the Court's ruling on burning of the American flag. A
number of people believe that to be an act which is not protected
by the first amendment, but the Court ruled otherwise. So this is
a case in which what I consider to be a violent act is construed to
be speech.
  We also have a situation in which speech can be construed to be
conduct. You would agree with that?
  Judge GINSBURG. That conduct
  Senator COHEN. That speech itself can constitute conduct.
  Judge GINSBURG. Can you give me an example?
  Senator COHEN. I could, but if I did, you couldn't answer the
question.
  Judge GINSBURG. Then you are tipping me off that I
shouldn't
  [Laughter.]
  You are starting me down the slope and I shouldn't put on the
skis.
  Senator COHEN. That is precisely where I want to take you. Let
me see if I can camouflage my intent here for a moment and go
back to the CCNV v. Watt case. In that particular case, the Govern-
ment argued that protesters could not sleep in the park. They could
demonstrate, they could parade in the park and they could stand
in the park, but they could not sleep in the park. The Park Service
argued it violated camping restrictions, and the district court ruled
in favor of the Park Service.
  The appellate court reversed, ruling 6 to 5 in favor of the
protestors, and you, as I understand it, joined in the majority deci-
sion, but you did not join in some rather sweeping language about
free speech--the on-site sleep of a round-the-clock demonstrator is
                                      226

indistinguishable from leaflet distribution, speeches or flag dis-
plays--or something to that effect on the part of the majority.

  You also rejected then Judge Scalia's position that the first
amendment only protected speech and not conduct, and I think you
called it or wrote that it was an arbitrary, less than fully baked
theory. Do you remember writing those words?

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. It would seem that the Supreme Court affirmed
your position as far as the first amendment applying to conduct as
well as speech. What you said is that "sleeping in symbolic tents"
has a "personal non-communicative aspect" that bears a "close,
functional relationship" to standing or sitting in such tents, that is,
it guarantees that the demonstrator is physically present to sustain
around-the-clock demonstration.
  Then you went on to say it is not a rational rule of order to for-
bid sleeping, while permitting tenting, lying down and maintaining
a 24-hour presence, and that "the non-communicative component of
the mix reflected in CCNVs request of permission to sleep * * *
facilitates expression."
  I can see my time is running out here.
  The CHAIRMAN. Finish your thought.
  Senator COHEN. The question I have is whether you would give
first amendment protection to any noncommunicative component of
the mix in a case that involves a facilitation of expression. In other
words, is that a test that we can apply in future cases that involve
conduct that is in some way related to speech that would be pro-
tected, or is this the same situation where you are going to say
don't take my words beyond the individual case?
  Judge GINSBURG. The facilitative aspect of it is not entitled to
the same protection as the expressive aspect of it. My comment in
relation to my colleague's opinion is that one cannot draw a line
between words and expression as he did, and say neatly, when you
speak, that is speech, and otherwise it is conduct. I gave, as an ex-
ample, this illustration: It is said that during World War II the
King of Denmark stepped out on the street in Copenhagen wearing
a yellow armband. If so, that gesture expressed the idea more
forcefully than words could.
  Senator COHEN. Let me just conclude. I have been struck by the
irony in which one can burn the American flag and that is constitu-
tionally protected speech, and yet, if one declares that one is gay
in the military, that is not speech, that's an act. It is a paradox,
perhaps, that exists, which you, Judge Ginsburg, in all likelihood
will have to resolve.
  My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. You have demonstrated several
things. The first part of your question is that you are a much bet-
ter commentator than those who ask you the questions.
  Senator Kohl, I got it right this time.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Just so I let it be known, one of my colleagues
passed me a note saying, "It's Kohl, not Feinstein."
  Senator KOHL. I asked them to do that.
                                         227

  The CHAIRMAN. It comes with age and senility on my part, Sen-
ator. I apologize for yesterday again. I imagine I will be apologizing
for the remainder of the year. Please go ahead.

  Senator KOHL. Judge Ginsburg, a brief question.
  First, earlier this year, as perhaps you recall, during the months
when President Clinton was searching for a replacement for Justice
White, one of Justice Scalia's law clerks, who was seeking to find
out who he would prefer as a colleague, asked the Justice whether
he would rather be stranded on a desert island with Lawrence
Tribe or Mario Cuomo. And as I am sure you remember, Justice
Scalia answered quickly and distinctively, perhaps, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.
  I have two questions. First, Judge, do you want to be stranded
on a desert island with Justice Scalia? Do you want to be stranded
on an island with him? [Laughter.]
  The second question is do you see yourself on the same island of
legislative intent that Justice Scalia now lives on?
  Senator HATCH. YOU can refuse to answer those questions, Judge.
  Judge GINSBURG. I can say one thing about Justice Scalia: He is
one of the few people in the world who can make me laugh, and
I appreciate him for that.
  On legislative intent, I think I answered the question earlier. We
have had on our court interesting colloquies about the difference in
our attitude toward legislative history. Wherever I am and wher-
ever he is, I think we will continue to have that interesting dif-
ference of view on the appropriateness of seeking help from legisla-
tive history.
  Senator KOHL. So I take it you don't feel safe on the same island,
you don't see yourself on the same island of legislative intent as
Justice Scalia?
  Judge GINSBURG. I don't on the question whether conduct is ex-
pression.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Ginsburg, I am still trying to get
a better sense of the way your experience as a person has impacted
your vision as a judge and as a potential Supreme Court Justice.
  As I reviewed your testimony and the conversation we had sev-
eral weeks ago, I was struck by how directly you have been touched
by injustice. You were, as we know, a victim of gender discrimina-
tion, and you told us yesterday of having been denied admission to
some resort, because dogs and Jews were not allowed there. Of
course, you told us your family left Europe, in part, to flee discrimi-
nation and persecution.
  Now, up until Chairman Biden introduced me yesterday, I myself
have never experienced gender discrimination. But I also remem-
ber seeing those "no dogs and Jews allowed" signs in the commu-
nity where I went to camp as a kid.
  As we all know, today, access to society's opportunities and insti-
tutions is still denied to many. For example, kids who can't vote,
who contribute money to politicians, are still left out. The growing
disparity between rich and poor in our country is barely being ad-
dressed. And while great progress has been made in civil rights,
many minorities and women are still denied full equality.
  I am in public life partly because I want to do what I can to ame-
liorate these conditions. What I would like to do is to discuss with
                                      228
you your motives, your commitment, and perhaps some of your pas-
sions.

  As an advocate, you, on behalf of all women in our society, slowly
scaled the mountain of injustice. As part of that process, you
turned to the courts, and it was there that you sought decisions to
extend the current range of rights for women. So I am a little bit
confused about the tension between the somewhat restrictive role
you describe for judges and the much more dynamic role that you
adopted as an advocate.

  This now is the third confirmation hearing that I have been in-
volved in, and in each of them, Judge Ginsburg, the nominee has
told us or asked us to ignore certain aspects of their personality or
their previous life-work experience, and you appear to be doing
somewhat of the same thing. You ask us to judge you almost only
as a judge, and not to consider very much of your experience as an
advocate. But I think we need to judge you as a total person, a per-
son who felt discrimination and fought against it, as a woman who
cares about the future of her children and grandchildren, in short,
as a whole person.

  I, for one, don't believe that you can shed your total life experi-
ences and your personality when you sit at the bench. I know you
do not have and should not have an agenda in terms of specific is-
sues, but I wonder if you have an agenda in terms of broad con-
cepts.

  When you were an advocate, you sought to persuade the courts
to listen to what were then novel arguments about gender discrimi-
nation. And as a Justice, when you sit with your colleagues to de-
cide what cases to hear, you will for that moment also be an advo-
cate, seeking to persuade your colleagues to accept certain cases
which raise certain kinds of issues.

  As a Justice, will you, as you did as an advocate, encourage the
Court to hear cases whose facts allow you to entertain novel claims
and break new ground? Or will you be inclined to be a moderate
incrementalist in that capacity, as well, encouraging the Court to
hear cases whose facts raise more narrow issues and restrict the
range of a decision?

  Finally, what I am trying to say, Judge, is that, as a lawyer, you
helped build a ladder which allowed women to climb into the courts
and begin the process of achieving equality. As others seek to con-
struct their ladder, do you feel any special obligation to help them
get their day in court?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I have not asked you to overlook, nor
have I apologized for, anything I have done. Some of the best work
I have done is reflected in my briefs. But I am a judge, not an ad-
vocate.

  I am reminded of the story that Judge Constance Baker Motley
tells. She was once asked to recuse herself from a title VII case,
because it was a sex discrimination case and she was a woman, so
surely she should not sit on the case. She reminded the lawyer who
made that application that there are only two choices, either you
are a man or you are a woman. She said she would decide that
case fairly and no one should think she is disqualified.

  Of course, the role of a judge is different from the role of an ad-
vocate. An advocate makes the very best case she can for her cli-
                                      229
ent. A judge judges impartially. A judge at my level takes what is
put on her plate. We don't have a choice.

  You are right in pointing out that the Supreme Court's jurisdic-
tion is discretionary, and the obligation of those judges is to take
the cases that most need a national solution. The Court doesn't sit
there to take the easy cases. You don't need a Supreme Court for
the easy cases. The Justices must look at what issues need to be
decided most for the Nation, and that's the basis on which the
judges make their decisions about what to take.

  I can't answer any more precisely than that, but I think one of
the reasons the Supreme Court was eager and urged Congress to
remove the mandatory jurisdiction was that the Court then could
take the cases that most needed a national solution.

  Senator KOHL. Well, I think that is a very good answer. When
you and your fellow Justices, in the event you are confirmed, will
be sitting, you will be deciding every year collectively, and you will
have the right and the obligation and the opportunity to exercise
the judgment as to which cases the Court will take. Just as a sim-
ple matter of fact, I think we need to point that out and under-
stand that, and when you make those decisions, you know you will
be exercising judgments, of course. And you said you will take
those cases which will most appear to need some national solution
in our society.

  So let me ask you: What do you think are the major problems
and challenges that face our society? I just throw out things like
racism, sexism, guns, crime, drugs. Give us some indication as to
what you think some of these major unresolved problems are that
we are facing in our society today.

  Judge GINSBURG. You listed a number of the ones that would be
on the top of anyone's list. But the Court doesn't deal with prob-
lems at large--crime or violence in our society. What comes to the
Court is a particular case raising an issue in a particular context;
unlike legislators, courts don't entertain general issues. They re-
solve concrete cases.

  The Court also considers timing. Sometimes the Court believes
it will be able to judge better, if it has more returns from the other
Federal courts. That is, perhaps the first time an issue is pre-
sented, the Court shouldn't take the case. Perhaps the Court would
benefit from the views of several judges on the question. If all of
the judges who have heard the matter are in agreement, the Court
might decide that it need not take up the issue.

  If there is a division among lower court judges, then there may
be a greater need for Supreme Court disposition. The idea is some-
times called percolation--having an issue aired in the lower courts
for a time, having commentators speak to it, so that when the
Court ultimately judges the case, it will be better informed to make
the decision. In some areas, that is a wise thing to do.

  One of the cases in which I participated--a decision the Supreme
Court reversed--might serve as an example. The case involved the
fourth amendment. The Supreme Court had decided that if police
officers stop a car, open the trunk and find a suitcase in it, they
can't open the suitcase without a warrant.

  Cases then trooped before the lower courts involving other con-
tainers in cars--cardboard boxes and plastic bags, for example.
                                               230

Lower courts began to draw a "luggage line"; some applied a "wor-
thy container" doctrine to determine when police officers needed a
warrant. One was needed for a leather suitcase, for sure; lower
courts were not so sure about lesser containers.

  My court, in that time of uncertainty, got the case of a leather
pouch and a paper bag, side-by-side in a car trunk. The three-judge
panel held that the police needed a warrant before they could open
the leather pouch, but didn't need a warrant to open the paper bag,
because it was a flimsy, unworthy container.

  I wrote an opinion for the full court saying we have now seen an
array of container cases, going from the leather suitcase to the
lowly paper bag, and we can't expect police officers to make worthy
container judgments on the spot. Either you can open a container
or you can't without a warrant. Because the Supreme Court had
held that police officers could not open a suitcase without a war-
rant, my court held police could not open any closed container with-
out a warrant.

  The Supreme Court said you have persuaded us that police offi-
cers should not be expected to draw luggage lines on the spot, but
you are wrong about the ultimate solution. Once police officers
have reason to stop a car, they can open the trunk and inspect any-
thing in it without a warrant. That was a situation in which it was
at first thought that police, and then courts, could distinguish be-
tween containers on the basis of their character. By the time the
issue got to the Supreme Court, the Court saw that a "worthy con-
tainer" rule would not work.

  The Court might not have seen that in the very first case. It took
a string of cases in the lower courts--there really were cardboard
box and plastic bag cases--all kinds of container cases. So that is
an example of percolation. The Supreme Court was better in-
formed, I think, in making the ultimate decision because the issue
had been considered in the circuits for some years and the Court
could take the variety of lower Court opinions into account when
it made its final decision.

  Senator KOHL. I know how much you care for your grand-
children. It is perfectly obvious to all of us who have seen this con-
firmation hearing, and it is a great thing.

  As you know, what we are doing without their ability to rep-
resent themselves is imposing an enormous tax burden on them.
We are building it up year by year, and they have no way to re-
spond, to react, to protest, to vote us in or out. They just sit there
and see it happen. And we all know that someday they are going
to have to pay a price for that.

  How can they be represented by the courts? Is there any way
that your court can represent them? There is taxation without rep-
resentation, an enormous burden of taxation without representa-
tion. Does that in any way strike you as something that the courts
might have a right to take a look at someday?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think you must represent them and their par-
ents must represent them, and we all must represent them. All
persons should care about the next generation. In a democracy, the
people and the legislators must care about what is happening to
the next generation.
                                      231
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Ginsburg, Justice Brandeis once
said that you can judge a person better by the books on their shelf
than by the clients that they have in their office. So I am asking
you what is on your shelf. Could you tell us a little bit about your
reading habits, the kinds of books you read, what book you most
recently read?
  Judge GINSBURG. I can tell you the two books I most recently
read. I don't know that these are representative, but most recently
I read "Wordstruck" by Robert McNeil, and Marian Wright
Edelman's book, dedicated to her children, 'The Measure of Our
Success."
  I haven't been doing heavy reading in these last 5 weeks apart
from reviewing over 700 of my opinions, to recall what I said in
them, and refreshing my recollection of various areas of Federal
law.
  My husband is a voracious reader. He often selects books for me.
He knows what I would enjoy. Every once in a while, I choose
something for myself, like 'The Bean Tree," which I recently read
and enjoyed. But when my husband reads a book he knows I would
particularly like, he says, "Read this one," like "Love in the Time
of Cholera," which I adored.
  Senator KOHL. Do you read a great deal of fiction or nonfiction,
or is it equal?
  Judge GINSBURG. I probably read more fiction because I deal
every day with so much nonfiction.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Ginsburg, if confirmed, you will
be replacing Justice Byron White, of course. What are your
thoughts on Justice White's career on the Court? In what ways do
you think you might be like or different from the person that you
are most likely to be replacing?
  Judge GINSBURG. The differences I think are obvious. I surely do
not have his athletic prowess. [Laughter.]
  He is very tall, and I am rather small. I have tremendous admi-
ration for him. I hope I am like him in dedication to the job and
readiness to work hard at it.
  I can tell you that he has been so grand and thoughtful. He
called me the day of the nomination, and called me at least twice
while cleaning up--he is moving his chambers--to ask me whether
I would like him to save for me this or that document, items he
thinks would be particularly useful for a new Justice. He has al-
ready sent me some pages with the advice, "Don't read this now,
but read it a month from now."
  He is a very caring, wonderful person. I would like to say some-
thing about Justice White that few people appreciate. It has been
said many times here that I argued six cases in the Supreme Court
and prevailed in five. If it had been up to Justice White, I would
have prevailed in all six because he voted for me every time. He
was the only one who did, although I am happy to say that Justices
Brennan and Marshall came close in that one case the Court de-
cided against my client. So I feel a particularly strong affinity to
Justice White.
  Senator KOHL. That is very good. Since your nomination, Judge
Ginsburg, there have been reams and reams of information that
have been printed and impressions that have been printed about
                                                232

you. Anything that you have read that has struck you particularly
as being reflective of the kind of a person you are? Or don't you
read these things? Don't they interest you? How would you de-
scribe, just in general terms, the person that you would like us to
know today on the eve of what may be your confirmation as a Su-
preme Court Justice? Recognizing that this is probably the last
time that the American people will ever have a chance to glimpse
you as a person and what you would like them to think most of
all when they think of you.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I would like to be thought of as someone who
cares about people and does the best she can with the talent she
has to make a contribution to a better world.

  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  We will now take a brief break and then come back, and we will
finish with our three distinguished colleagues. We will take these
in the order of three, and then we will close down for the day,
Judge. So we will take now a 10-minute break. Let's try to come
back at 25 after, maybe about 13 minutes, and then we will start
with Senator Pressler when we come back, then Senator Feinstein,
then Senator Moseley-Braun.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. Judge, welcome
back.
  Senator Pressler, the floor is yours.
  Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much.
  Judge, as I mentioned to you in the meeting in my office, in my
State and in the Western part of the United States there are a lot
of questions about Indian jurisdiction and problems between non-
Indians and Indians on or near reservations. And I subsequently
sent you a series of questions that I might ask.
  I might say that I also wrote to all the lawyers in my State and
asked them for suggested questions, and they sent back lengthy re-
sponses about what I should ask. I have stacks of their letters here
somewhere. I am going to have to write all of them a thank-you
note. If they watch this, they might be disappointed if I don't ask
their question. But I don't think I can ask you all the questions
they sent because some of them have been covered. But many of
the questions they sent did involve tribal jurisdiction and some of
the problems that affect Native American people.
  Now, the Constitution in article I, section 8, gave Congress the
power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the
several States, and with the Indian tribes. Over the years the Fed-
eral Government has employed various policies to structure its re-
lations with the tribes. Federal policy toward the tribes has run the
gamut from waging war against them to viewing them as depend-
ent beneficiaries of a Federal trust relationship, creating reserva-
tions for them, allotting individual tracts of land to their members,
attempting to assimilate them into the dominant culture, terminat-
ing their tribal status, to the present time affording them greater
self-determination.
  Apart from the right or wrong of any of these policies, the fact
of the matter is that my constituents, Indian and non-Indian, must
live with the present-day realities descended from these policies.
                                               233

These realities lead to litigation that comes before the courts for
resolution.

  Let me say that it is not only in South Dakota, but I read in the
paper that Connecticut even has a dispute over Indian lands, and
I believe other east coast States have unresolved Indian questions.
So it isn't strictly a Western issue.

  But, first of all, do you take an expansive or restrictive view of
tribal sovereignty?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I take whatever view Congress has instructed.
Senator, Congress has full power over Indian affairs under the
Constitution, and the Supreme Court has so confirmed, most re-
cently in Morton v. Mancari (1974). Judges are bound to accord the
tribes whatever sovereignty Congress has given them or left them,
and as a judge, I would be bound to apply whatever policy Con-
gress has set in this very difficult area. Control is in the hands of
Congress, and the courts are obliged to faithfully execute such laws
as Congress has chosen to enact.

  Senator PRESSLER. NOW, what type of analysis might you apply
in deciding the legal boundaries of tribal sovereignty?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I am not equipped to respond absent informa-
tion about the particular case. Without the benefit of briefs and ar-
guments, all I can say is that I would attempt faithfully to follow
the law as laid down by Congress, taking account of the precedent
in point.

  Senator PRESSLER. What weight would you give to each of the
following when deciding cases involving disputes with the Indian
tribes in view of what the Constitution says? Treaties between the
tribes and the Federal Government that have been written over the
years. We have a trust relationship between the Federal Govern-
ment and the federally recognized Indian tribes. And, finally, the
power of Congress to legislate matters relating to Indians and In-
dian tribes.

  Judge GlNSBURG. As far as treaties are concerned, Congress can
abrogate treaties with the Indian tribes, and to the extent Congress
has not done so, the treaties would be binding on the Executive.

  And your next inquiry concerned?
  Senator PRESSLER. There are treaties and there is the trust rela-
tionship. I believe the Secretary of the Interior is the trustee for
the American Indians, and there is a special relationship between
the Federal Government and federally recognized Indian tribes.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The Court made clear in the Cherokee Nation
(1831) case that when Congress indicates in a treaty or a statute
that the Government is to assume a trust relationship with a rec-
ognized tribe, the Court will then apply that policy. And with re-
spect to the power of Congress to legislate, the Supreme Court has
consistently recognized that Congress has full power over Indian
affairs.
  So my answer is that this is peculiarly an area where the courts
will do what Congress instructs, recognizing that these are very
difficult questions for the legislature to confront and resolve.
  Senator PRESSLER. Perhaps the No. 1 complaint I hear from my
constituents in Indian country, both Indian and non-Indian, is in
the area of law enforcement. The Federal Government, while it has
the authority in Indian country to prosecute minor crimes, chooses
                                                234

not to do so given limited resources. Assaults, thefts, beatings, and
vandalism, crimes falling outside the purview of the Major Crimes
Act, which confers Federal jurisdiction, are routinely unpunished
because of jurisdictional voids or checkerboard jurisdictions so com-
plicated that it is impossible for the law enforcement officer to
know who has jurisdiction to take action over any given crime. It
varies given the type of crime, the legal description of the land it
was committed on, and the Indian blood level or tribal affiliation
of both the victim and the suspect.

  Into this legal jungle, we have sent four different jurisdictional
layers of law enforcement--local, State, Federal, and tribal--to
keep order. The problem is that we have no set of rules with which
to work. It is not practical to have a court hearing every time they
need to determine who has the authority to take action. As a re-
sult, action is often not taken.

  When I meet with tribal chairmen, which I do frequently, this
frequently is cited as one of the most pressing problems facing In-
dian people today. They want tough law enforcement but cannot
get it. I hear the same from non-Indians living in or near Indian
country.

  In a case which illustrates such problems, Duro v. Reina--it is
a 1990 case--the Court held that Indian tribes could not exercise
jurisdiction over Indians who committed misdemeanor crimes on
the tribe's reservation if the violator was not a member of the tribe
exercising jurisdiction. As the State had no jurisdiction over such
individuals and Federal law enforcement generally declined to ex-
ercise jurisdiction in this area, many felt a jurisdiction void had
been created by the Court. While Congress later abrogated Duro,
the episode starkly highlights the jurisdictional problems that
occur in law enforcement in Indian country.

  I guess my questions are: Can you envisage a way State authori-
ties might be able to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country in
those instances where law enforcement voids appear to exist?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Congress can certainly give the States such au-
thority. The example that you gave, the Duro v. Reina (1990), is
a case on point. In Congress' judgment, the courts got it wrong and
Congress corrected their error. And with respect to the question
you just asked, if Congress so chooses, it can give the States that
law enforcement authority.

  Senator PRESSLER. Given the problems that the current patch-
work jurisdiction nightmare presents for people living in Indian
country, that is on or near reservations, do you feel it is possible
to reconcile these disparate law enforcement situations through
clearer Court rulings, or is specific congressional action required?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I can't address that question in the abstract.
Clearer Court decisions are always desirable. But out of the context
of a specific case, I am not equipped to give you a more precise an-
swer.

  Senator PRESSLER. Should there be limited Federal court review
of tribal court decisions, as is the case with State courts?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Again, Congress has plenary authority over In-
dian affairs and it can authorize Federal courts to review tribal
court decisions. Whether Congress should do so is a judgment the
                                               235

Constitution commits to the first branch, not to the third branch,
of government.

  Senator PRESSLER. NOW, Federal allotment policies around the
turn of the century divided up Indian reservations, giving tracts of
land to individual Indians. In many cases, these individual allot-
ments were sold in fee to non-Indians. We now have the situation
where many acres of non-Indian fee-own land lie within the bor-
ders of Indian reservations.

  This has created a checkerboard ownership pattern, with non-In-
dians owning some land, Indians owning other parcels, and other
land held in trust by the Federal Government for tribes. This situa-
tion has prompted many court cases which often must resolve the
question of whether the State or the tribe has jurisdiction over non-
Indians or non-Indian lands.

  What is your view of how the courts can clarify issues arising out
of the checkerboard jurisdictional patterns in Indian country?

  Judge GiNSBURG. Again, Congress prescribes the jurisdiction,
and I would apply the law as Congress declares it. I can't offer any
policy-based view on this issue, because the question is one that is
committed to the Congress.

  Senator PRESSLER. AS you now, beginning in the late 1800's and
continuing to the early 1900's, Congress and the President opened
many of the reservations in the West to non-Indian settlement. In
the process, non-Indians were granted patents in fee for their
lands. According to the Supreme Court in the Duro case, the 1990
Supreme Court case, the population of non-Indians on reservations
generally is greater than the population of all Indians, members
and nonmembers.

  This series of questions is intended to deal with the status of
non-Indians on the reservations. Can you describe for me the im-
portance of Indian self-government in the constitutional frame-
work?

  Judge GiNSBURG. Congress has not been perfectly consistent in
dealing with that question. Sometimes, as you pointed out in your
opening statement, Congress has sought to eliminate or curtail
tribal self-government, and other times, notably in more recent
times, it has sought to strengthen tribal self-government. Fostering
self-government seems to be the current trend, although some stat-
utes still limit tribal sovereignty. Again, these are legislative deci-
sions for the Congress to make.

  Senator PRESSLER. Indian tribes do not allow non-Indians to par-
ticipate in their elections, to serve in tribal office, or to serve on
tribal juries, generally speaking. In view of these facts, do you see
a principled basis for allowing an Indian tribe to impose civil fines
and forfeiture against non-Indians who reside on the reservation
with regard to activities on the land owned by non-Indians?

  Judge GiNSBURG. Again, this seems to me peculiarly a policy
question committed to the judgment of Congress, and it is the func-
tion of judges to apply whatever solution the legislature chooses to
enact.

  Senator PRESSLER. DO you see a principled basis upon which
Congress can delegate to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction
over non-Indians, especially non-Indians who are residents of the
reservation?
                                                236

  Judge GINSBURG. This question, too, raises policy matter that
calls for a judgment by the legislature. Judges would be obliged to
apply whatever law Congress enacts, but I am not equipped to com-
ment on a policy question that is so clearly committed to the legis-
lative branch.

  Senator PRESSLER. In the area of Indian civil rights, in the Su-
preme Court case of Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, the U.S. Su-
preme Court held that suits against a tribe for violation of the In-
dian Civil Rights Act may not be brought in Federal court. As a
result, individual tribal members, although citizens of the United
States, are limited to relief, if any, in their respective tribal court
systems. Many tribal governments do not provide for a court sys-
tem independent of the executive, creating the possibility of intimi-
dation by the executive leadership.

  Several years ago, I cosponsored legislation with Senator Hatch
which would have permitted individuals who had exhausted their
remedies in tribal court for violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act
to bring an action in Federal court. This measure did not become
law. Thus, people turned to the Supreme Court. Should Native
Americans be entitled to the same constitutional protections af-
forded to all Americans in our Federal courts?

  Judge GINSBURG. Again, all I can say is that Congress has full
power over Indian affairs, and the Federal courts will follow the
policy Congress sets in this area.

  Senator PRESSLER. NOW, are you aware of any Supreme Court
civil rights discrimination cases involving Indians? And what is
your view of these cases?

  Judge GINSBURG. In Morton v. Moncari (1974), it was argued
that the category "Indian" was a racial classification. The Court
held that, given the history of our country, the category "Indian"
was not racial but political.

  Senator PRESSLER. In a recent Supreme Court decision, South
Dakota v. Bourland, decided a month ago, the Court held that In-
dian tribes did not have the power to regulate the hunting and
fishing of non-Indians on fee-owned land within the boundaries of
the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation that had been taken by the
Federal Government when it constructed a flood control project. Do
you have any comments on that case and its significance in the
area of tribal jurisdiction?

  Judge GINSBURG. That case is a precedent that may require in-
terpretation in cases that will arise in the future. It would not be
proper for me to comment on how that precedent will be inter-
preted in the next case, when the next case may be before a court
on which I serve.

  Senator PRESSLER. DO you feel the Court was correct in basing
its analysis of the case of Montana v. United States, which is a
1981 case, which held that the tribal power did not extend to the
regulation of hunting and fishing by nonmembers on reservation
land owned in fee by nonmembers of the tribe?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I feel obliged to give the same re-
sponse to that question. It calls for interpretation of a precedent
likely to figure in a future case.

  Senator PRESSLER. The ninth circuit, in Washington Department
of Ecology v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, held that
                                               237

States could not regulate the activities of an Indian tribe in operat-
ing a solid waste project, only the Federal Government can regu-
late the operation of such facilities on Indian reservations. Do you
have any thoughts on whether an Indian tribe can be made to com-
ply with environmental regulations of a State, whose regulations
are more stringent than those of the Federal Government?

  Judge GlNSBURG. This is a matter that might come before me, if
this nomination is confirmed. I would have to decide it in the con-
text of a specific case, and I can't preview or forecast my decision.

  Senator PRESSLER. The Indian Gaming Act mandates that the
States negotiate in good faith with the tribes in establishing com-
pacts regulating reservation gambling. The statute does not define
good faith nor set out much direction for what is required by either
party.

  As you know, Indian gaming has become a controversial issue in
many States. What are your views with respect to the ability of
Congress to mandate that these two sovereigns negotiate in good
faith, without providing significant direction to either?

  Judge GINSBURG. The Indian Gaming Act is a new and much liti-
gated law. Cases concerning that legislation may well come before
me, so at this time I am not in a position to comment on it.

  Senator PRESSLER. In the 1970's, when I was a member of the
House, I was quoted by the Supreme Court, albeit in a footnote, be-
cause they wanted some legislative history. I had helped the Sioux
Tribes by working for legislation that allowed them to go back into
court enabling them to file suit in the Court of Claims for com-
pensation for the Black Hills of South Dakota, the doctrine of res
judicata and collateral estoppel notwithstanding.

  After the passage of that legislation, the U.S. Supreme Court
rendered a lengthy opinion, United States v. Sioux Nation of Indi-
ans, which held, in part that with passage of this legislation, Con-
gress' mere waiver of the res judicata effect of a prior judicial deci-
sion rejecting the validity of a legal claim against the United States
does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.

  The Court went on to rule in favor of the Sioux Tribes on the
basis for the case, holding that an 1977 Act of Congress effected a
taking of tribal property, property which had been set aside for the
exclusive use and occupation of the Sioux by the Fort Laramie
Treaty of 1868. That taking implied an obligation on the part of the
Government to make just compensation to the Sioux Nation.

  The money awarded for the Sioux claim to the Black Hills has
been appropriated and placed in a trust account. The judgment,
with interest, now amounts to more than $300 million. A plan to
use and distribute the money must be agreed upon by the tribes,
before the money can be put to good use by the Native Americans
entitled to the judgment. I would like to see the award distributed,
but the lack of unanimity on the part of the tribes as to whether
to accept the award has prevented this from occurring.

  What is your view of the importance of United States v. Sioux
Nation of Indians in the area of Indian land claims?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, Sioux Nation (1980) is a well-known
and very significant case. As you mentioned, it resulted in one of
the largest judgments for an Indian tribe in the history of our
country, and it righted what many people considered to be a very
                                              238

old and a very grave historical wrong. Also, it set down some clear
guideline for handling Indian just compensation claims. It brought
some clarity to an area that was notably murky.

  With regard to the current situation--the distribution of the pro-
ceeds--that is a matter that may very well be back in the lap of
the Court, so I can't comment on that part of it.

  Senator PRESSLER. DO you regard monetary compensation as
awarded by the Supreme Court as an equitable remedy to settle In-
dian land claims?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Again, that is the very issue that may be com-
ing up. The adequacy of monetary relief is what some people are
challenging.

  Senator PRESSLER. DO you see any need to depart from the tradi-
tional approach the Court has used in deciding Indian land claims?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Again, that will be the very question at issue,
if the case does come back to the Court. So I can offer no comment
beyond recognizing the importance of that precedent, both in terms
of the size of the award and the guidelines it laid down for just
compensation.

  Senator PRESSLER. Moving away from the Indian jurisdictional
questions, another question that several lawyers in my State sug-
gested I ask involves wetlands. The Federal Government frequently
takes productive farmland out of production and classifies it as a
wetland. Wetland determinations facilitate certain environmental
and wildlife management objectives.

  In my view, the application of wetlands regulations, the deter-
mination of what does and does not constitute a wetland ap-
proaches absurdity at times. However, the definition of what con-
stitutes a wetland is not my concern today. Rather, the Federal
Government's designation of wetlands causes farmers in my State
to lose income due to the fact that their land has been taken out
of production.

  How do you square the Federal Government's regulation of wet-
lands with the fifth amendment's prescription against taking pri-
vate property for public use, without just compensation?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, we know that the Government cannot
take, but it can regulate, and the point at which regulation be-
comes a taking is one of the hottest issues before the Court at the
moment. The Supreme Court most recently said in the Lucas
(1992) case that if the regulation effectively deprives the owner of
the entire value of the land, then even though the law is phrased
as a regulation rather than a taking, the owner would be entitled
to just compensation.

  There must be dozens or scores of cases in which litigants are
seeking clarification of the line between regulation and taking. I
can't offer now anything more than to say I appreciate that the
issue is very much alive, and that the most recent decision, the
Lucas decision is hardly the be-all-and-end-all. If confronted with
such a case, I will do my best to prepare for it diligently and give
it my best judgment.

  Senator PRESSLER. In the area of small business, employer ver-
sus union rights, I know another Senator already has asked about
this issue, but I will take it from a slightly different point of view.
In the Xidex Corporation case, a 1991 decision, you voted in the
                                         239

majority in a case involving a series of actions taken by Xidex
Corp. following its purchase of a new plant that had been a union
shop. The union alleged many of these actions constituted unfair
labor practices.

  An administrative law judge in the NLRB agreed with the union
on several points, and you enforced their orders against Xidex, as
I understand it. In Xidex, the circuit court relied on the holding in
NLRB v. Brown, that antiunion motivation will convert an other-
wise ordinary business act into an unfair labor practice. Please
elaborate on what you understand this standard to mean.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Pressler, may I ask, since the name of
that case is not immediately familiar to m e - --

  Senator PRESSLER. It is a long name, Microimage Display Divi-
sion of the Xidex Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board;
it is a 1991 case, 924 F. 2d, 245.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I have just asked for some assistance in finding
the opinion. It is not one I wrote.

   Senator PRESSLER. We can come back to it or you can address
it later, if you want to, after you get a chance to look at it.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Thank you.
   Senator PRESSLER. I have several followup questions regarding
that case involving the relationship between labor and manage-
ment, particularly in small business, but I will save them and ei-
ther ask them later or ask them for the record.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Sorry. Even though I have written over 700 de-
cisions, I usually remember the names. But I do not recall Xidex
(1991).
   Senator PRESSLER. That is all right. How do you feel about arbi-
trary caps on damages?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I think you loaded that question by
calling them arbitrary. [Laughter.]
   Senator PRESSLER. That was from one of the lawyers to whom I
wrote and asked for questions, so I will only take partial respon-
sibility. Let's just talk caps on damages.
  Judge GlNSBURG. If the legislature sets a cap on damages, then
the matter will come before the courts, and judges will attend to
the record, briefs, and arguments that the parties make with re-
spect to it.
   Senator PRESSLER. But you can declare them excessive or you
can
  Judge GlNSBURG. I can't express a view on that, apart from the
contours of a particular case.
   Senator PRESSLER. I guess the most commonly asked question by
attorneys in my State is--and you have addressed this to some ex-
tent, but to boil it down--does the nominee wish to interpret the
Constitution as a static document, or does she wish the Court to
initiate creative changes or creative new approaches?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have said that I associate myself with Justice
Cardozo who said our Constitution was made not for the passing
hour but for the expanding future. I believe that is what the
Founding Fathers intended.
  My assistants just handed me the case you mentioned. I was on
the panel, but the decision was by my colleague, Judge Karen Hen-
derson. In addition to the 700-odd decisions I have written, if I
                                                240

were to review every case in which I was on the panel, I would
confront thousands of opinions. I haven't even attempted to do
that, and this decision by Judge Henderson is not now in the front
of my mind. I will be glad to refresh my recollection and attempt
to answer any questions you have about it. But when one is a con-
curring judge and doesn't do the actual writing, the

  Senator PRESSLER. OK, good. I will ask you about that in a fu-
ture round of questions, because the small-business community
feels that is an important case from their point of view, and there
are two or three other questions about it which I will give to you
in writing, and I will try to ask them in a later round.

  Judge GINSBURG. Now that I have the case, I will certainly read
it and refresh my recollection.

  Senator PRESSLER. My time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Now, Judge Ginsburg, one of the few things you have not done
in your career is serve in an elected capacity. Now you know how
we feel when we are debating in the middle of a campaign, after
having cast literally 18,000 votes and a press person or an oppo-
nent says, "What did you mean when you cast the vote on S. 274
in 1968?" And so we can sympathize with your inability to reiftem-
ber every single solitary decision. I am amazed you remember as
many as you do. If we remembered that many votes we had cast,
we would all be better for it.
  Judge GINSBURG. I recall that a lawyer once asked me, "But,
Judge Ginsburg, in the such-and-such case in which you concurred,
footnote 83"--and it really was footnote 83--"said * * *. Are you
backing away from footnote 83?" At that moment I decided that I
don't concur in footnotes, especially when they get up over 50.
[Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Believe me, I share your concern, your position.
  Senator Feinstein, thank you for waiting.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You have now
turned to the equal protection side of the table. We appreciate it
very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. I want to explain, by the way, for all who are
watching, if the Senator will yield. The two women on the commit-
tee are sitting at the end of the platform. That is not because they
are women; it is because they are the most junior members of the
Senate on the Democratic side. And so I just want to--I was think-
ing about that today. As we are going through all this discussion
of the equal protection clause and women's rights, as we should, I
kept thinking, but they are probably home saying why don't they
let the women ask any questions? It is purely because of seniority,
a rule that when I arrived here as No. 100 in seniority I thought
was horrible, and I now think has merit. [Laughter.]
  Senator Feinstein.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, not only have I found you a scholar, but you
have also got incredible stamina. And I might say that one of the
special things for me today has been to sit here and watch you, be-
cause I am not a lawyer, reduce things to kind of their basic, sim-
ple element and explain them so that they were much more easily
                                      241
understood. I think that is a very special teaching talent, and it is
very clear to me that you have it.

  I want to talk to you about four subjects, if I may today. They
are guns, choice, capital punishment, and quotas. And I don't know
whether I will end up just thrusting and you will parry, but I want
to do it as someone whose experience is that of a former mayor of
a big city and also as a grandmother. And I am hopeful that we
might just have a conversation with a few people listening on the
side.

  Let me begin with the second amendment. I first became con-
cerned about what the second amendment means with respect to
guns in 1962 when President Kennedy was assassinated, and then
with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. And then I watched
the evolution of serial murders in this country and then the growth
of assault weapons and their prevalence on our streets.

  We said we shared the same age, and on my birthday a gunman
walked into a swimming pool and shot at six youngsters. And then
I went home on our break, and I went to one of San Francisco's
premier office buildings, and someone had just walked in and
wounded six, killed eight, and shot himself.

  Then I picked up a newspaper where a 3-year-old had pulled a
loaded assault weapon from under a bed and fired three bullets
into his sister.

  And so I went back to the second amendment, and I read it
again, and it said, "A well-regulated Militia"--capital M--"being
necessary to the security of a free State"--capital S--"the right of
the people to keep and bear Arms"--capital A--"shall not be in-
fringed."

  And then I understand that in 1939 in a decision called United
States v. Miller, the Supreme Court held that the obvious purpose
of the second amendment is to protect the viability of the organized
State militia. Since Miller, the lower Federal courts unanimously
have held that the second amendment protects the people's right
to keep and bear arms only in connection with service in the orga-
nized militia, today's National Guard.

  Now, as a mayor, I tried to do something about it through the
law, found that the State had preempted the area of licensing, reg-
istration, and when we tried possession, the Supreme Court of the
State of California said the State also controls the area of posses-
sion. This very committee--Senator DeConcini, Senator Metzen-
baum--has legislation that aims to deal with assault weapons, and
the chairman of this committee, very shortly, has consented to
allow there to be a hearing, for which I am very grateful because
several victims would like to testify.

  And so I am somewhat puzzled, and let me ask this question: If
the Federal courts, as I believe they have, have unanimously held
that the second amendment protects the right of the people to keep
and bear arms only in connection with service in the organized mi-
litia, today's National Guard, do you agree with this consensus ju-
dicial interpretation of the second amendment?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Feinstein, I can say on the second
amendment only what I said earlier. The Court has held that it is
not incorporated in the 14th amendment; it does not apply to the
States. What it means is a controversial question. The last time the
                                                242

Supreme Court spoke to the issue was in 1939. You summarized
that decision, and you also summarized the state of law in the
lower courts. The matter may well be before the Court again. All
I can do is to acknowledge what I understand to be the current
case law, that the second amendment is not binding on the States.
Given my current situation, it would be inappropriate for me to say
anything more than that. I would have to consider, as I have said
many times today, the specific case, the record, briefs, and argu-
ments presented. It would be injudicious for me to say anything
more than that with respect to the second amendment.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you.
  Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that a 15-minute rollcall
vote has just been called.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Yes, it has. I suggest maybe, Sen-
ator, you decide whether it is best to break now in your line of
questioning or continue to the next line and then break when we
receive the halfway--but it is up to you.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. YOU are not going to recess so we are just
going to keep going?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO. I will recess because there are few of us here
now, and I will recess so we can all go and come back, because I
am anxious to hear what you have to ask as well.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. All right. Maybe it might be appropriate to
go and vote and then come back, if that is agreeable with you.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. We will recess for the approximately 10
to 12 minutes it takes us to get over there and vote, and then we
will come back, OK?
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  As I said, Judge, we had two votes. They threatened we may
have one more vote. Hopefully it will not occur before we finish the
questioning tonight, but we will finish tonight on the first round.
  The floor is yours, Senator Feinstein.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Just to try to pursue that a little bit further, Judge Ginsburg,
could you talk at all about the methodology you might apply, what
factors you might look at in discussing second amendment cases
should Congress, say, pass a ban on assault weapons?
  Judge GINSBURG. I wish I could, Senator, but all I can tell you
is that this is an amendment that has not been looked at by the
Supreme Court since 1939. And apart from the specific context, I
really can't expound on it. It is an area in which my court has had
no business, and one with which I had no acquaintance as a law
teacher. So I am not equipped to enlarge my response. If the Court
takes a case involving the second amendment, I would proceed with
the care that I give to any serious constitutional question.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Fair enough. Let's go on, then, to the next
topic.
  I was very interested in your discussion with Senator Brown,
particularly--this is the issue of choice--because you began to
touch on the Casey case, and then somehow got a little distracted.
  If I understand what you are saying--correct me if I am wrong--
you are saying that Roe could have been decided on equal protec-
                                                243

tion grounds rather than the fundamental right to privacy. And I
think you noted that Struck could have served as a bridge linking
reproductive choice to the disadvantageous treatment of women on
the basis of their sex. Is that fair so far?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, Senator, except in one respect. I never
made it an either/or choice. That has been said in some accounts
of my lectures. It is incorrect. I have always said both, that the
equal protection strand should join together with the autonomy of
decisionmaking strand, so that it wasn't a matter of equal protec-
tion or personal autonomy, it was both.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. I see.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I would have had added another underpinning,
one I thought was at least as strong, indeed, stronger. But my ar-
gument was never equal protection rather than personal autonomy.
It was both. I used the Struck case as an example, because it was
the first time I fully expressed myself on this subject. I urged that
it was a woman's choice either way--her choice to bear or not to
bear a child. So the only amendment I would make in what you
said is that it was never either/or; it was both.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. SO, in essence, there are two tests out there
that could be used. One is equal protection, and the other is the
right to privacy. Is that
  Judge GlNSBURG. I would put it in terms of principles on which
the decision could rest rather than tests to apply, but principles.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Right.
  Judge GlNSBURG. One of the underlying principles is the auton-
omy of the individual, the other is the equal dignity of the woman.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Right. Let's proceed on.
  Then in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, it was enunciated
a new test, and as I understood it, the Court upheld various limita-
tions on abortion because they did not unduly burden women seek-
ing such services. And as I heard you earlier, statutes which limit
fundamental rights get strict scrutiny by the Court. Statutes which
classify on the basis of gender receive heightened or intermediate
scrutiny.
  My question is: Did the Court in Casey explicitly erode the pro-
tections previously afforded women under Thornburgh v. American
College of Obstetricians'?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have two responses. One is, as I said before,
that heightened scrutiny for sex classifications remains an open
question. Justice O'Connor made that clear in the Mississippi Uni-
versity for Women (1982) case. Sex as a suspect classification re-
mains open. It wasn't necessary for the Court to go that far in that
case. The Court struck down the gender-based classification. So it
is not settled that sex classifications will be subject to a lower de-
gree of scrutiny than limitations on fundamental rights. It is just
that the Court has left the question open, and it may some day say
more.
  If you are inquiring about the specific rulings in Thornburgh
(1986) as against the rulings in Casey (1992), yes, I think there are
respects in which Casey is in tension with Thornburgh. Restrictions
rejected in Thornburgh were accepted in Casey. So I must say yes,
the two decisions are in tension, and I expect that the tension is
going to be resolved sooner or later. Similar issues are likely to
                                                244

come before the Court again, so I can't say more than yes, the two
decisions are in tension; that is where we are at the moment.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. YOU said that they are in contention? Would
you say that Caseyis as reasoned as Thornburghl

  Judge GINSBURG. What I would say is that the two decisions are
in tension, not in contention, because to some extent they overlap.
These are decisions that are rather dense. I mean this--there are
numerous opinions, and it is difficult to work through them all.
The one thing I do sense is that this is a matter likely to come up
again, so I believe it would be inappropriate for me to say anything
more than what I have already acknowledged. There was no major-
ity opinion in the Casey (1992) case. I think that is about what I
can say.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. That was a help, and
I thank you for that.

  Let me turn to capital punishment, and let me speak as a Cali-
fornian. I believe the people of California voted in 1978 overwhelm-
ingly to reinstitute the death penalty. Since that time, there has
been a very long delay before its carrying out.

  It was recently carried out in one case, the case of Robert Alton
Harris, which is a rather notorious case, and brings up the whole
habeas corpus discussion.

  I believe Harris had 6 Federal habeas petitions and 10 State ha-
beas petitions. It is my understanding that the delay was due in
large part because the ninth circuit took a while to decide.

  Earlier in these discussions, you discussed the finality versus the
fairness of habeas, and I think, if I understood you correctly, you
said that you believed, yes, it was right to think that things had
to be brought to a logical conclusion within finality.

  If laws are going to work in this country, they have to have some
finality to them. And the older I get, the more clearly I see that.

  One of the biggest concerns that people have is that justice no
longer seems just because it never happens, or it takes a long time
for it to happen.

  You also raised the fairness, which I guess is the competence of
counsel issue. Would that be fair to assume?

  Judge GINSBURG. That's a large part of it, yes.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. With over 300 cases on death row, do you
have concern that there is a lack of finality, because of Federal ha-
beas review? Could you be more specific at all, when you speak of
finality? It is interesting to me, because of the crime bill, major dis-
cussion on habeas, what is fair in terms of a wait. Is it 6 months?
Is it 1 year? Is it 18 months?
  The Attorney General testified before us earlier, she said as long
as there was competency of counsel, she believed, too, that there
had to be finality and, therefore--I am paraphrasing her, but I
think I am accurate, and, Mr. Chairman, correct me if you think
I am wrong--she said whether it is 6 months or 1 year or 18
months, really is not consequential, as long as there is competency
of counsel.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct, that is my recollection, as well,
Senator.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Would you concur in that?
                                                245

  Judge GlNSBURG. I do not know what her testimony was. I do
know that Congress has before it Justice Powell's report, and that
the first action to be taken with respect to this fairness/finality bal-
ance is going to come from Congress, based on Congress' study of
that Powell Commission Report.

  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator will yield to me on that point
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Of course.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. The Judge is absolutely correct. As
a matter of fact, I think we will be able to announce in the next
day or so that, after literally 5 months--it is going to sound like
an exaggeration--of close to around-the-clock negotiations with the
Attorneys General and the District Attorneys Association, we have
reached a compromise. So I hope with the support of the Senator
from California, who has been deeply interested in this issue, we
will be able, Judge, to pass a piece of legislation that gives some
life to the thrust of the Powell Commission Report.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. The reason I am asking this, as a nonlawyer,
a former mayor who has a great deal of interest in the crime bill,
as the chairman correctly stated, is because the issue of habeas is
so very complicated, and any insight that you might have with re-
spect to both fairness and finality, I would certainly appreciate
hearing.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Feinstein, I commented before that I
realize this area is very complex. We don't have that kind of review
in this district, because, unlike the State of California, the District
of Columbia is not a State for this purpose. The District of Colum-
bia has local courts created by Congress, and Congress has pro-
vided a postconviction remedy that is just like the Federal remedy,
so if you are convicted in the District of Columbia courts, there is
no habeas review in our court.
  If I am confirmed, this is going to be altogether new business for
me. I haven't had experience with habeas petitions and I haven't
had experience with death cases, either. I know what the history
is in California. Your State supreme court held that the death pen-
alty was unconstitutional under the State constitution. That judg-
ment, made in People v. Anderson (1972), was reversed by the peo-
ple in a referendum, wasn't it?
  Senator FEINSTEIN. That is correct, in 1978,1 believe.
  Judge GlNSBURG. But the District doesn't have the kind of State-
Federal review that you have proceeding from your State courts to
the Federal district courts and the ninth circuit. I know something
about what has gone on in the regional circuits. I have not had ex-
perience with these cases myself.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.
  Moving right along to the third topic of the day, to another con-
troversial issue, which is the issue of quotas in affirmative action.
Again, let me go back to my mayor's experience. In 1979, there was
a Federal case, concerning police officers consent decree, and I was
mayor and did not support a consent decree which initially con-
tained quotas, for the very reason that I have seen quotas used to
discriminate against, as well as to prevent discrimination, and
have never felt that it is a very good vehicle for bringing about af-
firmative action.
                                                246

  Instead, the consent decree that I did support and which became
the law of the city was one that provided goals and timetables and
a master to oversee the department as it moved along, and we
made some very good progress, both with respect to people of color,
first minorities, first gays in the San Francisco Police Department.

  I know you have favored affirmative action, but you nave gen-
erally taken a very restrained approach on the subject of quotas in
local government hiring and contracting. I was wondering if you
would care to comment on your decisions in that area and your ju-
dicial philosophy that brought about those decisions.

  Judge GlNSBURG. My circuit recently decided a set-aside case, the
O'Donnell (1992) case. It was the same kind of case as Croson
(1989). We followed the Supreme Court's precedent and said that
the District of Columbia's plan was invalid.

  Most plans I have had anything to do with are of the kind that
you describe, not fixed, rigid quotas, but goals and timetables,
which are really estimates of what the workforce would be, if there
were fair employment practices. In so many of these cases, a whole
range of items are implicated, including tests.

  I remember some police cases involving tests, physical tests that
women could not pass at the same rate as men, but that were not
at all related to job performance. So some of the plans include new
tests that are related to what the job requires, and do not include
standards, unrelated to job performance, that men can meet more
readily than women.

  I remember one test particularly. The job involved was slide pro-
jectionist. As part of the physical test, the applicant had to carry
a certain weight with arms raised above his head. That posture
was much harder for women than for men, and women failed that
portion of the test disproportionately. But the weight that had to
be carried was something like 18 to 20 pounds, about the weight
of a year-old child. Women have carried that weight from the be-
ginning of time, but not with arms lifted over their heads. Once
you eliminate that element of the test, the women begin instantly
to pass at least at the same rate as men.

  Many of these job classifications and tests were set up one way
without thinking--with no thought of including women. Eliminat-
ing such tests is part of the kind of positive affirmative action that
does not entail rigid quotas, but estimates of what one would ex-
pect the workforce to look like, if discrimination had not operated
to close out certain groups.

  Senator FEINSTEIN. Yes, that is certainly true. Of course, even
though when the tests were revised for job related strength capac-
ity, it was still difficult for some women, I must say that. There
still was a rate where women could not pass it, but many women
did and I think that really harkened the day where women could
go into police departments and fire departments and have some de-
gree of equal opportunity. We are not entirely there yet, but there
has been a big change.

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me just change to the Japanese intern-
ment case, because this also is a major issue where I come from,
and I very much appreciated your comment that the Korematsu
case was wrongly decided. I would certainly agree with that.
                                         247

  With regard to the Hohri v. United States case, it is my under-
standing that you voted to permit victims of the internment to file
claims for confiscation of their property during World War II. Be-
cause this might be useful in the future, could you elaborate on
why Korematsu was wrongly decided, and why you believe so
strongly that the plaintiffs in Hohri should be able to sue long after
the internment policy was relegated really I supposed to the dust
bin of history?

  Judge GlNSBURG. In Hohri (1987), our decision was not the final
decision. The key question before us concerned the right court in
which to bring that case. The Supreme Court, in a well-stated opin-
ion by Justice Powell, held that the case belonged in the Federal
circuit and not in the District of Columbia Circuit.

  Justice Powell's decision, incidentally, said there was a tenable
case to be made for either side. Congress had not been clear about
whether the case belonged in our court or in the Federal circuit,
the specialized Federal appeals court in this city.

   The question on the merits in Hohri concerned when the statute
of limitations began to run. The view my court took of that ques-
tion was different from the view ultimately taken by the Federal
circuit.

  Korematsu (1944), as presented to the Supreme Court, involved
a challenge to a race classification--people of Japanese ancestry--
and a defense based on national security. We now know--it came
out clearly in the fifties--that the pressing national security need
urged before the U.S. Supreme Court didn't exist and never ex-
isted. An overwrought general wrote an affidavit that the Court re-
lied on. J. Edgar Hoover, hardly someone who had no concern
about national security, had said that there was no reason to have
the kind of massive relocation program our country ordered during
World War II. The FCC said that the alleged communications be-
tween the West Coast and Japanese ships at sea didn't exist, ei-
ther.

   The question was at what point in time the clock began to run.
When did the people affected have a claim a court would hear. We
said the clock began to run when it became clear that there was
no national emergency justification for curfews and relocation.

   Now, the end of the story is that Congress passed legislation pro-
viding compensation. Before that there was a congressional dec-
laration recognizing that a wrong had been done. There were two
dissents in Korematsu itself. I recall one, the dissenting opinion of
Justice Murphy. Every judge, I believe, would like to think he or
she would have joined Justice Murphy, had he or she been a mem-
ber of the Court at that time. But no one can say for sure. History
has certainly made it plain that there was nothing like the kind
of emergency the Court was told of, nothing that required the kind
of treatment to which people were subjected solely on the grounds
of their race or ancestry.

   Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Judge Ginsburg, I just
want you to know that, for me, it has been a very great pleasure
and privilege to listen to this. You really are a remarkable person.
I am also just very proud that you are a woman.

   Judge GlNSBURG. I appreciate your saying that so much.
   Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein.
  Senator Moseley-Braun.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Last, but not least.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. YOU know, I think it kind of makes me
the most popular person in this room, that I am now starting the
last of the questioning for the evening. But it makes it a little dif-
ficult, obviously, when you are number 18 in a grueling session
such as we have had, and I just want to thank and applaud the
Judge for her patience and her deliberate manner. You have been
just hanging in there, in spite of the fact that you have been talk-
ing all these hours and answering questions all these hours and
mental gymnastics with the members of the committee.
  I want to thank my senior Senator, who I know is only here be-
cause he has been so nice to me and he is looking out for me.
  Senator SIMON. I am here because I want to hear Judge Gins-
burg.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. YOU want to hear Judge Ginsburg, not
me. [Laughter.]
  OK. You see, that is also why he is the senior Senator. Thank
you, Senator Simon, for staying.
  Judge Ginsburg, as you know, this month the worst deluge in
memory has caused massive flooding along the Mississippi and
Missouri Rivers and devastated much of the Midwest, including
vast areas of my home State of Illinois. This has been a tragedy
of epic proportions.
  One of the most notable developments has been the failure, at
several points along the various rivers that were affected, of levees
that were denied to hold the waters back. The rupture of these lev-
ees has prompted a heated debate among scientists and engineers
and environmentalists, farmers and thousands of ordinary citizens.
  On one side are the people who say that the levees, which were
artificially created to begin with, have distorted the Mississippi's
natural drainage system, can never be built high enough to antici-
pate all of nature's fury, and may even make flooding worse by
channeling the waters so that they become even faster and higher.
  Supporters of the levees, on the other hand, claim that through
the construction of the levees and other flood control systems, thou-
sands of acres of land have been turned into productive farmland,
housing and recreational areas.
  In short, Judge Ginsburg, across a wide swath of the country,
thousands of people and entire communities have made decisions,
and invested their savings in some instances, for more than 100
years on where to locate their homes and their farms in reliance
on this system of levees.
  As I mention, though, this year's disaster and some new sci-
entific evidence has prompted many to argue that pulling down the
levees or actually not reconstructing them might actually improve
flood control and, in terms of the environment, be better for the
communities as a whole.
  In fact, some have speculated that one day in the near future,
the Army Corps of Engineers or some other arm of the executive
branch may determine that the levees are counterproductive to re-
                                      249
gional flood control efforts and damaging to the environment, and
decide to tear the system down, or not to rebuild it.

  While conceivably beneficial to the region as a whole, such a de-
cision would clearly impact the use that thousands of individual
landowners could make of their property. Clearly, in this situa-
tion--and the reason I ask this question, Judge, is because you
have done so much in the area of administrative law and adminis-
trative decisionmaking, and I want to get to how you perceive and
approach these issues, when a citizen's interest and rights are up
against an arrayed power of the bureaucracy.

  Clearly, as in a situation such as the levee situation--and it is
all speculative, because this is just a debate that is going on--what
an administrative agency decides to do or not to do, as the case
may be, will matter greatly to the expectations that have been built
up over time.

  So I have two questions. The first is, in a situation like this, if
the property owners challenge the government action as a taking
of their property, what principles should the Supreme Court look
to in evaluating that claim?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, the question has some kinship to the
one that Senator Pressler raised about the wetlands. It is an evolv-
ing area of the law. There is a clear recognition that at some point
a regulation can become a taking. When that point is reached is
something to be settled in the future.

  We do know that, as the Court held in the Lucas (1992) case,
when the value of the property is totally destroyed as a result of
the regulation, a taking has indeed occurred and there must be
compensation for it. Reliance is certainly one of the factors that
must be weighed.

  This is a still evolving area and I can't say any more about it
than what is reflected in the most recent precedents, in the Nollan
(1987) case and in the Lucas case. But there is sensitivity to the
concerns. On the one hand, the regulations are made for the benefit
of the community; and on the other hand, there is the expectation,
the reliance interest of the private person. Those two consider-
ations will have to be balanced in future cases. I can't say anything
more at this point.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, let's approach it, and I don't
know if this is an approach that will be productive. But looking at
the whole issue of deference to agency decisionmaking, if the prop-
erty owners challenge the Army Corps of Engineers on substantive
grounds, what principles do you think should govern how much
deference should be given the agency's determination and decision-
making?

  Judge GlNSBURG. It depends on what the agency is doing. If the
agency is construing a law in which Congress has, in effect, dele-
gated to the agency a gap-filling function, that is one thing. If the
agency is simply applying a general principle, that is something
else. You know we do have a guiding decision called Chevron
(1984). That opinion instructs that, when the meaning of a law is
uncertain, courts ordinarily should defer--that doesn't mean abdi-
cate--deference means treat with due respect the agency's interpre-
tation of it.
                                              250

  Now, that is a rule of construction, of determining what Congress
wanted. Congress can say it doesn't want us to defer to the agency.
There was a time when the Bumpers amendment had quite a fol-
lowing. That measure would have told courts not to defer. The Su-
preme Court's current doctrine in this area calls for deference to
agency rulemakings. Congress knows that, and Congress is at lib-
erty to change the orders under which courts are now operating.
That is, if there is an ambiguity in the direction Congress has
given, and the agency reaches a decision that is permissible, a per-
missible construction of congressional intent, then courts are sup-
posed to respect that decision. But Congress can always tell us to
take a different approach to statutory construction.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. In a dissent in which you joined in the
case of San Luis ObispoMothers for Peacey. the United States Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission, you joined in a dissenting opinion
against a decision that upheld the issuance of a license for the con-
struction of a nuclear power plant on an earthquake fault, despite
the lack of a hearing on safety implications.

  That dissent, which was actually written by someone else, stated
that:

  It defies common sense to exclude evidence about the complicating effects on
earthquakes at a plant located three miles from an active fault. The majority's pre-
occupation with probability calculations does not justify the Commission's stubborn
refusal to do the obvious.

  So in that case, the decision flew in the face of doing the obvious,
of common sense, and I suppose the question becomes, as we look
at the whole issue of, again, due deference: Do you believe that in-
jured parties, that people, should be afforded access to review by
the courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, in cases like this
in spite of the expert judgment of a bureaucrat regarding agency
action?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I said that deference does not mean abdication.
A decision I wrote bears some resemblance to the fault case. It in-
volved placing nuclear material in salt domes. Yes, I think it is im-
portant that there be review, judicial review, of bureaucratic ac-
tions. Bureaucrats don't have to stand for election as you do.
Courts are needed to check against bureaucratic arrogance. That is
an important role that courts have.

  On the other hand, agencies do feel beholden to the legislature.
That is where they get their money from, and so they are account-
able to you as well.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think that is a fine answer, Judge,
and that is very important because so many agency decisions im-
pact on people's lives, sometimes even more than what we do here
in the legislative branch. And it is just important--you mentioned
the system of checks and balances. It is so very important to have
a court willing to look out for the interests, the concerns of ordi-
nary people in their everyday lives, again, in these situations
where the bureaucracy just kind of rolls on and spins along some-
times without regard to the individual interests.

  I would like to change the subject a little bit because I have sev-
eral areas in which I would like to ask you questions or explore,
and I don't know how much of this is new territory. I have listened
to all the testimony, and I know you feel that you have probably
                                      251
answered some of these questions before. But to bring my own per-
spective to some of these issues that we are all concerned about in
terms of how you approach judging, how you approach being a
member of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  I want to change the subject to talk about voting rights for a
minute. I was very touched yesterday in your testimony when you
mentioned as a child seeing signs in front of a Pennsylvania resort
that said "No dogs or Jews allowed." For a moment I would like
to share with you my own recollection of what you have, I think,
aptly described as American apartheid, which is what we went
through.

  In the summer, when I was little, we used to get sent south
every summer to spend the summers on the farm, and we would
travel by train. And at that time the South was still openly seg-
regated on the basis of race. In fact, just going over some of these
cases, I am reminded of how very recent striking down of some of
those barriers has been.

  But, anyway, we were small, and I was about eight or nine; my
little brother was about six or seven. And we stopped at a train
station one day, and it was a hot summer day, and we had been
traveling for hours with my mother. We were tired and thirsty, and
we got into the train station, got off the train, walked to the train
station, and there were two different water fountains. One was la-
beled "Whites Only" and the other was labeled "Colored." And my
mother told us very firmly that she didn't want her children drink-
ing out of a colored water fountain.

  We both pleaded with her. We were thirsty. We wanted some
water. And she wouldn't let us have any water. She said we will
just wait until we get to the house.

  Well, my little brother laid out in the middle of the train station
and had a temper tantrum because he wanted some colored water.
He expected it was going to be green or blue or yellow or a rainbow
of colors. [Laughter.]

  And he was determined he was going to see and have some col-
ored water that afternoon.

  We have obviously come a long way in this country since that
trip, Judge, and I can share that story with you now. And it is hu-
morous and it is funny. It kind of points to the absurdity of how
Jim Crow and how that apartheid operated.

  But there are other aspects, those aspects of the history of this
country that are not so humorous even with the passage of time.
I want to call your attention to the troubled history of voting rights
specifically in the State of North Carolina.

  In 1900, an amendment to the North Carolina Constitution
barred blacks from voting unless they could prove, among other
things, that they were descended from a Confederate soldier. The
result of that, of course, was that very few blacks in North Caro-
lina in 1900 were able to vote.

  Tactics such as these were openly utilized up to and through the
enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Although African
Americans comprised 22 percent of North Carolina's population,
until 1992 no African American had represented the State in Con-
gress since Reconstruction.
                                                252

  As you know, in the recent case of Shaw v. Reno, which we have
had some discussion about, the Supreme Court chose to ignore that
troubled history. In Shaw, the Supreme Court held that North
Carolina's 12th Congressional District--a district, I might add, that
was drawn in compliance with guidelines from the previous admin-
istration's Department of Justice, the Bush administration's De-
partment of Justice--that that district violated the equal protection
rights of the State's white voters.

  The ruling was issued in spite of the fact that the Court was un-
able to conclude that any white voter had been actually injured,
had suffered any injury by virtue of the drawing of this district.

  I would like to ask you about the Court's decision in Shaw. It
would probably be inappropriate to ask you if you would overrule
that decision or how you would decide in any voting rights case
that might come before the Court. What I would like to know is
whether or not you think the majority's decision in Shaw ignores
the very real, the very tragic, and very painful history of voting
rights violations, not just in North Carolina but throughout this
country?

  Judge GlNSBURG. That is an unfinished case. The Court re-
manded it, and it may well come back again. So I can't address
that case specifically, but I know what you have in mind. I know
about the literacy tests that were given to blacks, tests that were
different from the tests given to whites. There was an extremely
complicated passage given to a black would-be registrant to vote.
When the would-be voter looked at the passage he was asked to in-
terpret, he said, "It means black people can't vote in this State."
So I appreciate your concern, and I know how recent the change
is.

  I remember going with my husband to an Army camp when he
was in the military service. We passed a sign that said--I thought
it said, "Jack White's Cafe." But it didn't. It said, "Jack's White
Cafe". I had never seen such a sign. I was fully adult, indeed preg-
nant at the time, so it was not so long ago that such things existed
in the United States. I am sensitive to that history. When I spoke
about Brown v. Board of Education, earlier today, I mentioned spe-
cifically the deprivation of the very basic right to cast one's ballot
that existed for so long in the United States for black people.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Judge, I would suggest--I have a map,
actually--where are the maps? The Court in the Reno case held
that the 12th Congressional District of North Carolina was so
bizarrely shaped as to invite an equal protection challenge. Here it
is right here. There is no question but that is not exactly a work
of art. There is no question but that the district lines were drawn
in a way--do you have a copy?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes. This is what the Court described as a
snake district.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Right. But as we talk about the his-
tory, this district was drawn this way in order to achieve the objec-
tives of the Voting Rights Act, which in and of itself was written
to overcome the history that you have so eloquently talked about.

  But in any event, we face a situation in which the history has
made it very clear that districts have been bizarrely drawn since--
well, I started to say time immemorial, but indeed the very word
                                             253

"gerrymander" comes from the drawing of a salamander-shaped
district by a politician named Gerry almost 100 years ago.

  And so I would suggest, just to point out, Judge, I have a couple
of districts here that are also bizarrely drawn. This is the 3d dis-
trict in Massachusetts, and this is the--got to turn it the other
way. It is upside down. That way, yes. This is the 5th district of
New York. And I think anybody would concur that these are simi-
larly bizarrely drawn districts as well, which were drawn in the
old-fashioned way; that is to say, with regard to political bound-
aries and incumbent party interests and because of the power
equation in the community.

  But in this instance, we see the Supreme Court has now decided
to, in the Shaw v. Reno case, throw out the history. The Court's
decision in the area of voting rights has changed the law alto-
gether. And there has been a lot of discussion today about concern
about judge-made law, but, quite frankly, Judge, I guess my ques-
tion would be: Would you not concur that where we have precedent
thrown out in order to invalidate a district drawn consistent with
the Voting Rights Act based on the bizarrely shaped rule, which is
a new rule as far as I can determine, that ignores the history of
why the Voting Rights Act was there to begin with, and in light
of the fact that no injury was shown, and in light of the fact that
there are other districts throughout the country that are bizarrely
drawn, would you not agree that we have in this instance judicial
activism of a very real sort?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I can't comment on the Shaw (1993)
case because, as I said, it is unfinished and it may be back in the
Court again. And I would have to see the record, briefs, and argu-
ments made in that very case. I can't prejudge what is going to be
the next round in it. I am obliged to give the same answer I have
given when that kind of question has been asked before about a
case that is still alive, one that can be back before the Court.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. All right. Then let me put the question
to you otherwise. Yesterday, when Senator Metzenbaum had asked
you about the views of Justices Scalia and Thomas in the Lemon
v. Kurtzman test, which is used to judge challenges under the es-
tablishment clause of the first amendment, in response to that
question you urged caution on the part of judges who wish to tear
down established law, stating that, and I quote,

  It is very easy to tear down, to deconstruct. It is not so easy to construct. I as
a general matter would never tear down unless I am sure that I have a better build-
ing to replace what is being torn down.

  Judge Ginsburg, what the majority opinion--and, again, looking
at the voting rights cases, we have now seen a deconstruction of
a system of legislative redistricting and voting rights enforcement
in the United States. That system, while it was not perfect, was an
effective system that has been arrived at through the efforts of var-
ious Congresses and administrations and even the courts. But in
one fell swoop, the Justices struck down this system without pro-
viding any guidance on how to reconstruct voting rights enforce-
ment, other than to say you don't go with bizarrely shaped dis-
tricts.

  States that relied on the voting rights precedent in drawing leg-
islative districts now find themselves subject to court challenges;
                                                254

and, further, the courts have no guidelines with which to just these
challenges.

  And so I would like to ask you how much consideration do you
think that a judge should give--now, this is going to be a real soft-
ball, Judge. This is not a--how much consideration do you think
that judges should give to difficulties that will arrive from
deconstructing an established constitutional test or enforcement
mechanism in areas such as voting rights?

  Judge GINSBURG. I can't speak to this specific case because I am
not familiar with the record. The Department of Justice is going to
have to study this case and prepare whatever its position is going
to be for future cases. But I can repeat what I said before, that a
judge should not tear down without having a better building to re-
place what is in place, and that is a general rule to which most
judges would subscribe. I can't say that is true of most law profes-
sors, but it certainly is true of most judges.

  I wish I could speak at a more specific level, but I really can't
without having before me the precise record on which I could make
an informed judgment.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I understand, and that is one of the
reasons why this particular area is difficult to talk about, because
of the uncertainties surrounding that entire area in voting rights
enforcement in light of the Shaw decision.

  But to take it another step and another aspect of voting rights
that I would like to pursue with you, another recent voting rights
case was Presleyv. Etowah, and I would like to talk with you about
that case a minute. I would like to first offer a brief summary of
the case. The Etowah County Commission had five members, and
each of the members' chief function in this rural Alabama county
was the allocation of highway construction and repair funds. Each
commissioner had complete control over how the funds were used
in his district--and I said "his" district and not "his or her" district
deliberately.

  The commission had been structured to ensure that no minorities
would be elected. After being sued under the Voting Rights Act, the
commission was expanded to six members, six commissioners. Two
commissioners were elected under the new changes, including Mr.
Presley, the county's first African American commissioner in the
modern era. Soon after that election, the four original commis-
sioners passed a resolution which abolished the practice of allocat-
ing road funds to individual districts.

  Under the changes, the two new commissioners had no power at
all to ensure that any road funds, even minimal funds, were ear-
marked for their districts.

  Now, one does not have to be a legal scholar to understand what
happened in this case. In direct response to an African American
being elected to the commission, the commission changed the rules
in the middle of the game to ensure that the newly elected black
official had no real power.

  Yet when Mr. Presley sued the commission under section 5 of the
Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court held that the acts of the
commissioners in stripping him of all real power were not changes
with respect to voting. The only explanation the Court gave for its
decision there was that "the line must be drawn somewhere."
                                      255
  Many people familiar with Presley, including the Bush adminis-
tration's Justice Department, wondered what was the point of
being able to vote for a county road commissioner if as soon as you
got that opportunity the commissioner was stripped of any author-
ity over what happens to the roads in your district.
  I have two questions. The first is: Would you agree that in inter-
preting the Voting Rights Act, the Court in Presleywas overly con-
cerned or more concerned with the language of the statute as op-
posed to its purpose? And, second, when the narrow interpretation
of the language of a statute would hinder the statute's ability to
achieve its purpose: Is it proper for a court to look beyond the lan-
guage in order to offer a remedy to citizens who have a valid griev-
ance?
  Judge GlNSBURG. That is a decision constructing a statute. If the
Court got it wrong, Congress can amend the Voting Rights Act and
say that the Court got it wrong. I suppose the view was that the
stripping of one commissioner was not peculiar to that commis-
sioner; every commissioner was similarly stripped. That leaves the
authority in the hands of the body as a whole, and the body has
only one minority member, as I understand it.
  But the argument was that the Voting Rights Act does not ex-
tend so far as to require court approval of how functions are allo-
cated within a governing body. That is the Court's construction of
what Congress ordered. The cure can be provided by Congress if
Congress thinks the Court got it wrong. And that is about all I can
say with respect to that case.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Judge, in this case, Justice Stevens de-
scribed this case as one in which a few pages of history are more
illuminating than volumes of logic and hours of speculation about
hypothetical problems. I suppose my question to you is: Other than
just waiting--I mean, other than saying, well, the Court may have
gotten it wrong here, which is what you have just said, do you see
any role in other decisions in suggesting to the Court that the his-
tory of these cases is as important in interpreting the specific lan-
guage?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think the advocates made that point to the
Court. I can't opine on that particular case because it wasn't before
me. If it had been before me, I would have been familiar with the
record, familiar with the arguments. All I know about it at this
point is the summary in U.S. Law Week. So I wish I could engage
in more of a conversation with you about it, but from the limited
information I have, it would not be judicious of me to speak fur-
ther.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, Judge, it appears that the light
is on. My chairman has left, but I am left with my loyal and faith-
ful senior Senator from Illinois. I want to thank you. I have other
questions that I suppose--I guess the way this works it will hold
for the second round of questions. But I do thank you for your re-
sponses, and I look forward to pursuing some of these other areas
with you.
  Mr. Chairman, thank you.
  Senator SIMON [presiding]. And we thank you, Judge, for a
lengthy day. You have served your cause well today. Let me also
thank your family members and that crew in back of you there who
                                               256

have had to go through all of this and have done it smiling, even.
They may not have felt like it, but that is what they are doing
there.

  The committee will convene tomorrow at 9:45 a.m. for an execu-
tive business meeting. When we say "executive," it does not mean
it is in closed session here. And then we will proceed immediately
to reconvene this hearing at 10 a.m. Our hearing stands adjourned.

  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  [Whereupon, at 7:56 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re-
convene at 10 a.m., Thursday, July 22, 1993.]
NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                         THURSDAY, JULY 22, 1993

                                                                   U.S. SENATE,
                                              COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:16 a.m., in room
216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Simpson,
Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen, and Pressler.
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order. Welcome back,
Judge.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is a pleasure to see you. I hope you had an
opportunity to get a good meal and get a good night's sleep and not
have to sit up and worry about more briefing books. We appreciate
your willingness to forbear as well as you have.
  Let me do a little bit of committee business here this morning
in terms of how we will proceed, and then make one comment.
  We have now completed our first round of questioning, and I
might add, sounding somewhat presumptuous, that I was im-
pressed by the line of questioning of our friend from Illinois. It was
obvious yesterday you are a graduate of the University of Chicago
Law School.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was impressed, and I thank you for being will-
ing, Senator, to stay and go as late as you did last night.
  But we have now completed our first round of questioning, and
as has been the committee tradition--I wouldn't say a tradition--
only since I have been the chairman. I am surrounded by two
former Chairs who chaired this outfit longer than I, and sometimes
I think they still wonder whether or not they should still be
chairing this committee. But they were wise enough to choose other
pursuits.
  We have, in the first round of half-hour questioning, allowing a
Senator and the nominee to develop a line of questioning without
artificial interruption.
  Now, what we have done in the past is shorten those rounds on
the second round, but my friend from Utah, the ranking member,
has indicated to me that some Members on his side, and possibly

                                                                 (257)
                                               258

on the Democratic side as well, may want to pursue a similarly
lengthy line of questioning with the judge. So unless there is a re-
volt in the committee, this is how I would like to proceed.

  We will go to 15-minute rounds unless a Senator asks before his
or her turn to question that they would like to have a 30-minute
round in order to flesh out the line of questioning they wish to pur-
sue because, as I said at the outset, no Senator will be cut off. In
other words, it is just going to be a matter of having two 15-minute
rounds or one 30-minute round. But no Senator will be cut off.

  The reason I would like to cut it down to 15 minutes is to allow
Senators to be able to have more interchange with their colleagues
in the questions rather than having to wait 2 or 3 or 4 hours to
get into the mix with a line of questioning that may be followed
on from when another Senator has finished questioning. So, in a
sense, I hope this procedure will enhance the prospect of a little
continuity in the questioning among the Senators. But any Senator
who wishes before he or she begins to question that this round be
a half-hour, should indicate their wish to the Chair and we will do
that. But I would hope we would, most of us, if we can, for the con-
venience of our colleagues, keep our rounds to 15 minutes.

  Judge, I will look for a signal from you and/or your husband or
whomever behind you to indicate when you would like to take a
break, but we will essentially do what we did yesterday. About
every hour-and-a-half, we will break and give you a chance to
stretch your legs. But anytime you wish to do that, that is not a
problem.

  Now, is that appropriate, Senator Hatch?
  Senator HATCH. I do believe that there are many questions that
our side would like to ask, so I am not--this isn't working.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS the other mike--we have complete control of
this committee. [Laughter.]
  And we are able to--this is one of the few times, Judge, I am
able to turn off the microphone on a Republican.
  Senator HATCH. Senator Simpson says there is a screw loose in
the speaker. I am not sure--that is ambiguous, it seems to me, but
I know those who believe that, anyway.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me make one last point. Over the last
few days, Judge, you have many times, at least from my perspec-
tive, appeared to be reticent to answer some of our questions, even
more so than recent nominees. This, as I indicated, concerns me,
and I believe the forum offered by these hearings, I think, is very
important.
  Once confirmed as a Justice, you generally will not appear before
the public to answer questions or to discuss your judicial philoso-
phy, and this hearing provides the only opportunity for a public
forum to hear the individuals who will make our critical constitu-
tional decisions.
  So last night I went back and, with my staff, reviewed the tran-
scripts of recent hearings, and I found, quite frankly, to be honest
with you, that you provided no less expansive answers than others
who have come before the committee, and also no more than others
who have come before the committee, of your views on the law and
your views on judging.
                                      259

  You do have a style that is precise and on occasion seems less
expansive when you answer a question, but you have given us
some significant substance on issues of privacy and equal protec-
tion, freedom of speech, and constitutional methodology.

  Still, I have to say, like other recent nominees, you have given
us less than I would like. I doubt whether any nominee would ever
satisfy me in terms of being as expansive about their views as I
would like. But on that score, I want to emphasize that you have,
as I have gone back and looked at the record, given us some genu-
ine insight and expansive answers on some of the critical issues,
maintaining your distinction between what you think is appro-
priate and inappropriate for a prospective Justice to comment on.

  But, still, I tell you that on my round of questioning I will return
to several subjects which I just mentioned--equal protection, free-
dom of speech, and constitutional methodology--to see if we can en-
gage just a little bit more. I thank you for what you have done so
far, but I hope maybe we can pursue these subjects a little more
without violating your understandable and self-imposed limitation
about getting involved in matters that may come before the Court
and in any way compromise you.

  But having said that, rather than take my round of questioning
now, since the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is the
manager of a bill on the floor on the national service legislation,
I will yield my turn to him and then go to Senator Hatch and then
back to me.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  As the chairman mentioned, we are considering a national serv-
ice bill on the floor of the Senate, so I missed part of the responses
yesterday, but I will look forward to reviewing the record carefully.
I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair now.
  I am just inquiring really in two areas. During my round on
Tuesday, Judge Ginsburg, we talked briefly about the very impor-
tant role of the Supreme Court in construing civil rights laws, and
I would like to return to that topic this morning.
  As you well know, the effort to pass legislation banning discrimi-
nation in public accommodations, employment, voting, and Federal
programs was a long and difficult one. Congress tried for many
years during the 1950's, with limited success. And it wasn't until
1964 that the landmark civil rights legislation was passed, and the
Voting Rights Act, which Senator Moseley-Braun asked you about
yesterday, was passed in 1965.
  It is not hard to understand why it is difficult for a popularly
elected legislature to pass laws to protect the rights of minorities
and women who have been the victims of discrimination. For too
long, legislatures were dominated by those who tolerated that dis-
crimination, and that is why it is particularly important to have on
the Supreme Court persons who appreciate the significance of the
civil rights laws and will construe them to achieve Congress' pur-
pose of eliminating discrimination.
  In the 1980's, the Supreme Court turned away from that ap-
proach and issued a series of decisions that dramatically cut back
on the legal protections against job discrimination: in 1989, in the
Patterson v. McLean Credit Union case; we had the Ward's Cove
                                                   260

Packing v. Antonio case; and then the AT&T Technologies case, the
Lawrence case. I think you are familiar with those cases.

  A bipartisan majority in the Congress joined together to pass the
Civil Rights Act of 1991 to overrule those decisions and several oth-
ers. So now those cases are dead letters because of the 1991 act,
so they can't come before you.

  My question is: What is your view of the approach to construing
civil rights laws taken by the Supreme Court majorities in those
cases?

  TESTIMONY OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO BE ASSOCIATE
  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Judge GlNSBURG. My view of the civil rights laws conforms to my
views concerning statutory interpretation generally; that is, it is
the obligation of judges to construe statutes in the way that Con-
gress meant them to be construed. Some statutes, not simply stat-
utes in the civil rights area but those in the antitrust area, are
meant to be broad charters--the Sherman Act, for example. The
Civil Rights Act states grand principles representing the highest
aspirations of our Nation to be a nation that is open and free where
all people will have opportunity. And that spirit imbues that law
just as free competition is the spirit of the antitrust laws, and the
courts construe statutes in accord with the essential meaning that
Congress had for passing them.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have overturned those decisions now
in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. I am asking you whether you are
willing to express an opinion about those cases that were over-
turned since it won't come back up to you and since now we have
legislated in those particular cases.

  Judge GlNSBURG. I don't want to attempt here a law review com-
mentary on the Supreme Court's performance in different cases. I
think the record of the decisions made in the lower courts can be
helpful. In some of the cases, the Supreme Court's position was
contrary to the position that had been taken in the lower Federal
courts. I believe that was true in the Ward's Cove (1989) case and
in the Patterson (1989) case. It is always helpful when Congress re-
sponds to a question of statutory interpretation, as it did in this
instance, to set the record right about what the legislature meant
to convey.

  Now, sometimes--I spoke of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act
and title VII--Congress is less clear than it could have been the
first time around. Maybe the ambiguity wasn't apparent until the
specific case came up. Congress reacted rather swiftly in that in-
stance and said, "yes/' discrimination on the ground of pregnancy
is discrimination on the ground of sex, and title VII henceforth is
to be interpreted that way.

  It is a very healthy exchange. It is part of what I called the dia-
log. Particularly on questions of statutory interpretation if the
Court is not in tune with the will of Congress, Congress should not
let the matter sit but should make the necessary correction. That
can occur even on a constitutional question. I referred to the
Simcha Goldman (1986) case yesterday, a case in which Congress
fulfilled the free exercise clause more generously than the Court
had.
                                         261

  We live in a democracy that has, through the years, been opened
progressively to more and more people. The most vital part of the
civil rights legislation in the middle 1960's was the voting rights
legislation. The history of our country has been marked by an ever
widening participation in our democracy. I expressed on the very
first day of these hearings my discomfort with the notion that
judges should preempt that process to the extent that the spirit of
liberty is lost in the hearts of the men and women of this country.
That is why I think the voting rights legislation, more than any-
thing else, is so vital in our democracy.

   Senator KENNEDY. In another area, we have certainly made im-
portant progress, as you mentioned, in the areas of banning dis-
crimination on the basis of race, we have on gender, we have on
religious prejudice, and more recently on disability with the pas-
sage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, banning discrimina-
tion against persons with disabilities.

   One form of discrimination still flourishes without any Federal
protection, and that is discrimination against gay men and les-
bians. I note that in a 1979 speech at a colloquium on legislation
for women's rights, you stated that "rank discrimination based on
sexual orientation should be deplored." By rank discrimination, I
assume you meant intentional discrimination rather than discrimi-
nation on the basis of rank in the military. I share that view, and
I think most Americans do.

   I would like to ask you whether you still believe, as you did in
1979, that discrimination based on sexual orientation should be de-
plored.

   Judge GINSBURG. I think rank discrimination against anyone is
against the tradition of the United States and is to be deplored.
Rank discrimination is not part of our Nation's culture. Tolerance
is, and a generous respect for differences. This country is great be-
cause of its accommodation of diversity.

   The first thing I noticed when I came back to the United States
from a prolonged stay in Sweden--and after I was so accustomed
to looking at people whose complexion was the same--was the di-
versity. I took my first ride in several months on a New York sub-
way, and I thought, what a wonderful country we live in; people
who are so different in so many ways and yet, for the most part,
we get along with each other. The richness of the diversity of this
country is a treasure, and it is a constant challenge, too, a chal-
lenge to remain tolerant and respectful of one another.

   Senator KENNEDY. I think we will leave that one there. Thank
you.

   The CHAIRMAN. It is not going to get any better, Senator.
   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My
time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Now I assume my colleague would
like half an hour.
   Senator HATCH. Yes, I think I would.
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield half an hour to our distinguished friend
from Utah.
   Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, just a real quick response, if you can. Are you for or
against TV coverage of the Court? I had a number of people in the
                                              262

media who asked me to ask that question. And I don't want to
spend a lot of time on it, and if you don't have an opinion, I would
be happy to hear that as well.

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Hatch, I spoke earlier about the C-
SPAN interview with me. I thought how unfortunate it was that
the audience couldn't view, because we didn't allow it at the time,
television of the proceeding itself.

  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge GINSBURG. I don't see any problem with having appellate
proceedings fully televised. I think it would be good for the public.
  Senator HATCH. I do, too.
  Judge GINSBURG. We have open hearings. If coverage is gavel-to-
gavel, I see no problem at all televising proceedings in an appellate
court. Some concern has been expressed about televising trials, but
we have come a long way from the days of the Sheppard (1966)
case when the camera was very intrusive and there was all kinds
of equipment in the courtroom that could be distracting.
  The concern currently is about distortion if editing is not con-
trolled.
  Senator HATCH. I understand. That is good enough for me I
would be concerned about the editing that goes on, too. You are
saying gavel-to-gavel you are for.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. OK.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. But I would be very respectful of the views
of my colleagues.
  Senator HATCH. Sure. No, no, I understand.
  In 1975, while you were at the ACLU, that organization adopted
a policy statement favoring homosexual rights. According to what
has been represented to me as minutes of a meeting on this matter,
the following is noted:

  In the second paragraph of the policy statement dealing with relations between
adults and minors, Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a motion to eliminate the sentence
reading, "The State has a legitimate interest in controlling sexual behavior between
adults and minors by criminal sanctions." She argued that this implied approval of
statutory rape statutes, which are of questionable constitutionality.

  Now, I realize that these events took place over 18 years ago, so
let me just ask you: Do you have any doubt that the States have
the constitutional authority to enact statutory rape laws to impose
criminal sanctions on sexual contact between an adult and a minor,
even where the minor allegedly consents?

  Judge GINSBURG. Not at all, Senator Hatch. What I did have a
strong objection to was the sex classification.

  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Judge GINSBURG. I think child abuse is a deplorable thing,
whether it is same sex, opposite sex, male-female, and the State
has to draw lines based on age.
  What I do object to is the vision of the world that supposes a
woman is always the victim. So my only objection to that policy
was its sex specificity.
  Senator HATCH. SO as long as they treat males and females
equally, that is your concern?
                                               263

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, and I think that as much as we would not
like these things to go on, children are abused, it is among the
most deplorable things, and it doesn't

  Senator HATCH. And the State has power to correct it.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, and has power to draw lines on the basis
of age that are inevitably going to be arbitrary at the edge.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I am relieved to hear that that was the
basis for your objection. It was a shock to me to learn, you know,
that the Constitution, some people argue that the Constitution de-
nies the State the right or the ability to protect young people and
teenagers by forbidding sexual contact between them and an adult,
even where the sexual contact is supposedly voluntary, and I am
concerned about that.
  Let me just move on to the death penalty. Now, I have a ques-
tion. One of the problems I had yesterday, you were very specific
in talking about abortion, equal rights, and a number of other is-
sues, but you were not very specific on the death penalty.
  Now, there are people on this committee who are for and against
the death penalty, as there are people throughout the Congress,
and my question is about the constitutionality of the death penalty.
I am not going to ask you your opinion about any specific statute
or set of facts to which the death penalty might apply. Also, I rec-
ognize that your personal views regarding the morality or utility of
capital punishment are not relevant, unless your personal views
are so strong that you cannot be impartial or objective. Then that
would be a relevant question and a relevant matter for us here
today.
  Rather, I would just like to ask you the following specific ques-
tion: Do you believe, as Justices Brennan and Marshall did, that
the death penalty under all circumstances, even for whatever you
would consider to be the most heinous of crimes, is incompatible
with the eighth amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual
punishment?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Hatch, let me say first that I appre-
ciate your sensitivity to my position and the line that I have tried
to draw.
  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Judge GINSBURG. Let me try to answer your question this way.
  Senator HATCH. All right.
  Judge GINSBURG. At least since 1972 and, if you date it from
Furman, even earlier, the Supreme Court, by large majorities, has
rejected the position that the death penalty under any and all cir-
cumstances is unconstitutional. I recognize that no judge on the
Court currently takes the position that the death penalty is uncon-
stitutional under any and all circumstances. All of the Justices on
the Court have rejected that view.
  Many questions left unresolved. They are coming constantly be-
fore the Court. At least two are before the Court next year.
  I can tell you that I do not have a closed mind on this subject.
I don't think it would be consistent with the line I have tried to
hold to tell you that I will definitely accept or definitely reject any
position. I can tell you that I am well aware of the precedent, and
I have already expressed my views on the value of precedent.
                                                    264

  Senator HATCH. But do you agree with all the current sitting
members that it is constitutional, it is within the Constitution?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I can tell you I agree that what you have stat-
ed is the precedent and clearly has been the precedent since 1976.
I must draw the line at that point and hope you will respect what
I have tried to tell you--that I am aware of the precedent, and
equally aware of the principle of stare decisis.

  Senator HATCH. YOU see, my question goes a little bit farther
than that. I take it that you are not prepared to endorse the Bren-
nan/Marshall approach that it is cruel and unusual punishment
under the eighth amendment. But in response to my previous ques-
tion, you stated that statutory rape laws are constitutional. Yet,
you are unwilling to really answer the question or comment on the
constitutionality--I am not asking you to interpret the statute, just
the Constitution--you are unwilling to comment on the constitu-
tionality or unconstitutionality of the death penalty.

  The thing I am worried about is that it appears that your will-
ingness to discuss the established principles of constitutional law
may depend somewhat on whether your answer might solicit a fa-
vorable response from the committee.

  Now, this is a touchy thing. I don't think anybody is going to vote
against you, one way or the other, on this issue, at least I hope not,
because I don't think we should politicize the Court. But it is im-
portant. For instance, the death penalty is, in effect, mentioned in
the 5th amendment and the 14th amendment to the Constitution.
The fifth amendment makes reference to a capital crime, stating
that no one could be held to answer for such a crime unless pursu-
ant to a grand jury. And this presupposes the constitutionality of
the death penalty.

  Now, the eighth amendment's bar on cruel and unusual punish-
ments was adopted at the same time as the fifth amendment, as
you know. And it obviously was intended to be read in conjunction
with the fifth amendment's express approval of the death penalty.
As well, the Supreme Court has affirmed the death penalty's con-
stitutionality, as you said, as early as 1976 in the case of Gregg v.
Georgia.

   Given the express constitutional provisions, presupposing the
constitutionality of the death penalty and the body of case law
reaffirming its constitutionality, I think you ought to tell us where
you really come down on this thing. Because I am not asking you
to decide a future case. I am just asking is it in the Constitution,
is it constitutional, or is there room to take the position that Bren-
nan and Marshall did, even though it is expressly mentioned in at
least the 5th and the 14th amendment, and probably six or seven
places in the Constitution, that they find it barred by the cruel and
unusual punishment clause of the 8th amendment.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Hatch, I have tried to be totally candid
with this committee.

   Senator HATCH. You have. You have.
  Judge GlNSBURG. You asked a question. I was asked a lot about
abortion yesterday. I can't
   Senator HATCH. YOU were very forthright in talking about that.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have written about it, I have spoken about it
as a teacher since the middle seventies. You know that teaching
                                                265

and appellate judging are more alike than any two ways of working
at the law. I tried to be scholarly in my approach to the question
then. I have written about it in law review articles. I authored a
dissert in that area in the DKT case.

  The question you raised about age lines, I had a stated objection
to drawing lines between males and females based on age, whether
it is for beer drinking, for statutory rape, for--the first time I en-
countered an age line I think was in your State, Senator Hatch.
Utah required parents to support a boy until age 21, but a girl only
until age 18. The case was Stanton v. Stanton (1975).

  Senator HATCH. I remember the case, but I can't remember
whether it is from Utah.

  Judge GlNSBURG. In any event, that's the way it was. It was sup-
port a boy until 21 and a girl until 18, and that age line was struck
down. So that is another area. Is the Stanton case not from Utah?

  Senator HATCH. Yes, it is.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The death penalty is an area that I have never
written about.
  Senator HATCH. But you have taught constitutional law in this
country.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have.
  Senator HATCH. It isn't a tough question. I mean I am not
asking
  Judge GlNSBURG. You asked me what was in the fifth amend-
ment.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The fifth amendment uses the word "capital."
I responded when you asked me what is the state of current prece-
dent. But if you want me to take a pledge that there is one position
I am not going to take
  Senator HATCH. I don't want you to take a pledge.
  Judge GlNSBURG [continuing]. That is what you must not ask a
judge to do.
  Senator HATCH. But that is not what I asked you. I asked you
is it in the Constitution, is it constitutional?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I can tell you that the fifth amendment reads
"no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infa-
mous crime, unless" and the rest. But I am not going to say to this
committee that I will reject a position out of hand in a case as to
which I have never expressed an opinion. I have never ruled on a
death penalty case. I have never written about it, I have never spo-
ken about it in the classroom.
  I can tell you that I have only one passion and it is to be a good
judge, to judge fairly. But I must avoid giving any forecast or hint
about how I might decide a question I have not yet addressed.
  Senator HATCH. I will accept that, but I have to say that
  Senator COHEN. Would the Senator yield?
  Senator HATCH. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. AS I recall, with all due respect, I believe that
Clarence Thomas was asked
  Senator HATCH. Both Souter and Thomas answered that question
very
  Senator COHEN [continuing]. Was asked the question whether he
had ever had a discussion about the case of Roe v. Wade, and he
                          266

was ridiculed by many members, and indeed the press at large for
saying he had never had a conversation.
Senator HATCH. NO, he didn't say that. What he said was--and
the press, even as late as this morning, one of our eminent press
people criticized obliquely Thomas for having never discussed abor-
tion.
What Thomas said was--and I will be honest with you, he did
it to get  "oyfefs>th"ewseubdjiedctd, isSceunsastoirt,  Leahy was asking the question--
he said                                                 but we were more interested in
Griswold v. Connecticut. That is basically what he said.  vT. hWenadSee1n?-"
ator Leahy came back, "Yes, but did you ever discuss Roe
And Thomas responded, I think very cleverly, and Senator Leahy
did get off the subject, he said, "I never debated it." Now, that is
a far cry from saying I never discussed it.
Now, the reason I am asking this question is there are very
few--give me a break, the fact of the matter--give Justice Thomas
a break, not you, Judge, but the media out there--they have been
misquoting that for years, ever since the hearings. But he was
vilified all over this country and slandered and libeled and criti-
cized, because he never discussed Roe v. Wade, as though that is
the paramount prime issue in our society. And it is one of them,
no question about it, regardless of what side you are on or whether
you are not on any side.
But I cannot imagine any particular subject that has been more
on the minds of the American people in criminal law through the
years than the death penalty. Let me just say this: I will take your
answer the way it has been given. You know, there are some who
believe that there has been an evolution of standards regarding
what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. But even this the-
ory cannot escape the express references in the Constitution to cap-
ital punishment.
It seems to me that any evolution to societal standards with re-
spect to the death penalty cannot be divorced from the fact that the
Constitution mentions capital crimes. And such an evolution of
standards by society which would deem the death penalty cruel
and unusual punishment or cruel and unusual I think would have
to be represented in the form of a constitutional amendment or by
repeal of the existing death penalty statutes.
Having said that, I just feel it is an important issue and one
that--I don't want a political answer.
Senator METZENBAUM. Could I respectfully point out to my
colleague
Senator HATCH. On your own time, you can.
Senator METZENBAUM. On my time. I don't wish to interrupt
him, but this same issue was before us in 1987 when Judge Ken-
nedy was up for confirmation, and at that time Judge Kennedy
stated, "I have taken a position with your colleagues on the com-
mittee that the constitutionality of the death penalty has not come
to my attention as an appellate judge and that I will not take a
position on it. If it is found constitutional, I think it should be effi-
ciently enforced."
Senator HATCH. Fine.
Senator METZENBAUM. So this is not the first time that we have
had a nominee who has declined to respond on this.
                                         267

  Senator HATCH. NO, but as we defined further, demanding of
members of this committee during the Souter and Thomas hear-
ings, they had to answer that question. That is all I am saying.
Now, I am going to let it go, because I respect the Judge and I have
a great deal of fondness and appreciation for her. But I don't think
that is a tough question, is it in the Constitution, is it constitu-
tional.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I have read that sentence and know
there is another reference to "capital," as well. I am glad you re-
spect my position. I have told you my view of judging.

  There are other people on this committee who would like to pin
me down to what am I going to do in the next case.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I am not one of them.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Even Senator Metzenbaum wants me to say
whether I would be with three or with two on some issues, and I
wouldn't answer. I have tried to be consistent in saying I believe
in this process, I have written about it, and I have said how impor-
tant I think the Senate role is. I also said I hope that we come to
this with mutual understanding.
  One of the things Senator Metzenbaum said was that Congress
should be more thoughtful and more deliberate about the role of a
judge. So I have tried to be as forthcoming as I can, while still pre-
serving my full and independent judgment.
  Senator HATCH. I understand, Judge, and I accept that. I do
think, though, that some of the cheap shots in the media about
Thomas ought to cease and they ought to read the doggone tran-
script before they make any more of them. As late as today, one
of our learned members of the journalism community misrepre-
sented again.
  Let me move on to something else. I would like to followup on
some of the exchanges you had with Senators Simpson and Leahy
regarding government funding. Now, you agree, as I understand it,
that the first amendment does not impose on government an af-
firmative duty to fund speech, is that right?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, I think it imposes on government a duty
to be impartial, and so I said if it chooses to fund political speech,
it can't choose between the Republicans and the Democrats.
  Senator HATCH. Right. Rather, it prohibits government from cen-
soring or interfering with individual expression, and I believe that
is your position as you have said.
  For example, freedom of speech doesn't mean that the Govern-
ment has to finance a lecture series for anyone who wants to speak
his or her mind, or that the Government must give people mega-
phones or loudspeakers or, likewise, freedom of the press does not
mean that the Government has to buy publishing equipment for as-
piring journalists.
  But in a recent concurring opinion, you wrote, the Government
taxing and spending decisions "are most troublesome and in great-
est need of justification, when distinctions are drawn based on the
point of view a speaker espouses, or when a benefit is provided con-
tingent and an individual is relinquishing a civil right." Now, that
was the case ofFEC v. International Funding Institute in 1992.
  I would like to probe just one aspect of that statement, specifi-
cally, your apparent view that government spending decisions are
                                                268

"most troublesome and in greatest need of justification, when dis-
tinctions are drawn based on the point of view a speaker espouses."

  Let's assume that the Government decides that not smoking is
better than smoking and that it subsidizes an antismoking cam-
paign through a grant program. May the Government give grants
only to those who adhere to the antismoking campaign or view-
point, or does the Constitution compel the Government to also sub-
sidize prosmoking campaigns by cigarette manufacturers?

  Judge GINSBURG. I may get myself into difficulty with the Sen-
ators from tobacco States, and I am a reformed sinner in that re-
spect myself. But this is a question of safety and health. I think
the Government can fund antismoking campaigns and is not re-
quired equally to fund people who want to put their health and the
health of others at risk. So my answer to that question is "yes," the
Government can fund stop smoking campaigns and it doesn't have
to fund smoking is intoxicating and fun campaigns. Yes, the Gov-
ernment can fund programs for the safety and health of the com-
munity.

  Senator HATCH. Congress, as you know, has established a Na-
tional Endowment for Democracy, and, you know, some might say
is engaging in unlawful viewpoint discrimination unless it also es-
tablishes a national endowment for the opposite side, say com-
munism or fascism or something like that.

  The point that I am making is that I respectfully submit that
your statement in your concurring opinion in the International
Funding case may be overbroad. Government-funded programs are
designed to serve certain policy goals. Those speakers who choose
not to promote these goals will naturally be excluded from the
funding.

  And to impose viewpoint neutrality on government funding pro-
grams simply because they happen to involve speech would be to
revolutionize government as we know it. And just as the taxpayers
need not subsidize the first amendment right of free speech, the
issue then arises do they need to subsidize abortions. Just as gov-
ernment programs may fund antismoking speech without funding
prosmoking speech, the Government Medicaid Program may cover
the expenses of childbirth, without covering the expenses of abor-
tion.

  The Supreme Court, as you know, settled this question in its
1977 ruling in Maker v. Roe, and then in its 1980 ruling in Harris
v. McRae. It ruled in those cases that the taxpayers do not have
to federally subsidize abortion. In some of your academic and advo-
cacy writings before you took the bench, you did criticize those Su-
preme Court cases and, as an advocate, that is easy to understand.

  But in the International Funding case, you cited Harris v.McRae
favorably in support of a distinction you drew between funding re-
strictions that are permissible and those that are not. Irrespective
of your views on the policy of abortion funding, do you agree that
Maker and Harris, those two cases, were decided correctly?

  Judge GINSBURG. I agree that those cases are the Supreme
Court's precedent. I have no agenda to displace them, and that is
about all I can say. I did express my views on the policy at stake,
but the people have not elected me to vote on that policy.
                                      269

  Senator HATCH. I understand, but yesterday you endorsed the so-
called constitutional right to abortion, a right which many, includ-
ing myself, think was created out of thin air by the Court.

  Judge GlNSBURG. But you asked me the question in relation to
the Supreme Court's precedent, and you have just asked me an-
other question about the Supreme Court's precedent. The Supreme
Court's precedent is that access to abortion is part of the liberty
guaranteed by the 14th amendment.

  Senator HATCH. That was just reaffirmed by a 5-to-4 decision
just a year ago, and this issue is going to be before the Court for
a long time in the future. But today, having opened the door on
specific issues such as abortion

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think your microphone is off again, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. I am sitting back and not
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Madam Chairman. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. I have got to speak louder, I think, when I sit
back in my chair.
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield? It is obvious, Professor,
you have been a professor for a long time, I think it is an endearing
quality.
  Senator HATCH. I think what the question is that I am asking
is do taxpayers, in your view, have a constitutional obligation or
duty to fund abortions.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Taxpayers don't have an obligation or duty to
do anything other than what Congress tells them they must do. I
know there is a taxpayers' protest movement, but people have to
pay their taxes, and you decide what their tax payments should
fund, as you are engaged in doing at this very moment.
  Senator HATCH. I understand.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The only point I tried to make is that, of all
the distinctions in the speech area, the ones we are most nervous
about are distinctions based on viewpoint. As I said, the Govern-
ment decides how it wants to spend its money. I think we would
all agree that if the Government pays for Republican speech but
not Democratic speech, that is not democratic.
  Senator HATCH. I would agree with that.
  Let me move on to another issue. In your response to the com-
mittee questionnaire on judicial activism, you stated,

   It is a reality that individuals and groups reflecting virtually every position on
the political spectrum have sometimes attacked the Federal judiciary, not because
judges arrogated authority but because particular decisions came out, in the critics'
judgment, the wrong way.

  Judge Ginsburg, in the 1857 case of Dred Scott v. Sanford, the
Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment's due process clause
prevented Congress from outlawing slavery in the territories. In es-
sence, in its first use of what we now call substantive due process,
the Court invented out of thin air a right to own slaves in the terri-
tories. Abraham Lincoln, among others, was highly critical of this
holding in the Dred Scott case.

  Now, do you think that the Supreme Court arrogated authority
in this holding in the Dred Scott case? And if so, why? And if not,
why not?
                                                270

  Judge GINSBURG. I think it was an entirely wrong decision when
it was rendered. The notion that one person could hold another
person as his or her property is just beyond the pale of

  Senator HATCH. SO they arrogated authority to themselves in
that case.

  Judge GINSBURG. I think they made a dreadfully wrong decision.
  Senator HATCH. YOU and I agree.
  The same thing in the Lochner era, with the Lochner v. New
York case. The Court arrogated its own authority to decide that
minimum wage laws were really on the basis of liberty of contract.
They invalidated State laws on minimum and maximum hours that
bakery workers could work in a week.
  Judge GINSBURG. The Court in the 1930's rejected the so-called
Lochner line. The Court, in that line of decisions consistently over-
turned economic and social legislation passed by the States and
even by the Federal Government. That era, in which the Court at-
tempted to curtail economic and social legislation, is over. Although
there may be some voices for a return of that kind of judicial activ-
ism, I think it is generally recognized that the guardian of our eco-
nomic and social rights must be the legislatures, State and Federal.
  Senator HATCH. I agree with you on that, but how do you distin-
guish as a matter of principle between the substantive due process
right of privacy that the Supreme Court has developed in recent
decades from the rights the Supreme Court developed on its own
accord in Dred Scott v. Sanford and the Lochner v. New York case?
  Judge GINSBURG. I don't think, Senator Hatch, that it is a recent
development. I think it started decades ago, as I tried to explain
in one of the briefs you have, one of the briefs that I referred to
yesterday, Struck.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge GINSBURG. It started in the 19th century. The Court then
said no right is held more sacred or is more carefully guarded by
the common law. It grew from our tradition, and the right of every
individual to the control of his person. The line of decisions contin-
ued through Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942), which recognized the
right to have offspring as a basic human right.
  I have said to this committee that the finest expression of that
idea of individual autonomy and personhood, and of the obligation
of the State to leave people alone to make basic decisions about
their personal life, Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Poe v.
Ullman (1961).
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge GINSBURG. After Poe v. Ullman, I think the most eloquent
statement of it, recognizing that it has difficulties--and it certainly
does--is by Justice Powell in Moore v. City of East Cleveland
(1977), the case concerning the grandmother who wanted to live
with her grandson.
  Those two cases more than any others--Poe v. Ullman, which
was the forerunner of the Griswold (1965) case, and Moore v. City
of East Cleveland--explain the concept far better than I can.
  Senator HATCH. Well, you are doing a good job, but in my view
it is impossible, as a matter of principle, to distinguish Dred Scott
v. Sanford and the Lochner cases from the Court's substantive due
process/privacy cases like Roe v. Wade. The methodology is the
                                      271
same; the difference is only in the results, which hinge on the per-
sonal subjective values of the judge deciding the case.

  Judge GINSBURG. In one case the Court was affirming the right
of one man to hold another man in bondage. In the other line of
cases, the Court is affirming the right of the individual to be free.
So I do see a sharp distinction between the two lines.

  Senator HATCH. I think substantively there may be, but the fact
of the matter is it is the same type of judicial reasoning without
the constitutional underpinnings.

  Now, one of the things I admired about your criticism of Roe v.
Wade is at least you would put a constitutional underpinning
under it by using the equal protection clause rather than just con-
jure something out of thin air to justify what was done. And at
least that would be a constitutional approach toward it.

  See, one criticism of judicially invented rights like some call pri-
vacy is the inability in any principled fashion to determine their
boundaries. In other words, whether or not such a right will be rec-
ognized in a particular context depends upon the predilection of the
judge deciding the case. And some of the most vocal supporters of
the right to privacy in the context of abortion would be the first to
object if the Supreme Court employed the same methodology look-
ing outside the text of the Constitution to protect economic rights,
say to cut back on the liberal welfare state. There would be just
as much objection to that.

  Now, one can favor various privacy interests as a matter of policy
and support legislation to protect them--and that is being done
here--and still recognize the illegitimacy of judges making up
rights that aren't found in the Constitution. Don't you agree with
that statement?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Hatch, I agree with the Moore v. City
of East Cleveland statement of Justice Powell. He repeats the his-
tory to which you have referred, the history of the Lochner era, and
says that history "demonstrates there is reason for concern lest ju-
dicial intervention become the predilections of those who happen at
the moment to be members of the Court." I know that is what your
concern is.

   Senator HATCH. That is what my concern is, as it should be.
  Judge GINSBURG. He goes on to say that history "counsels cau-
tion and restraint," and I agree with that. He then says, "but it
does not counsel abandonment," abandonment of the notion that
people have a right to make certain fundamental decisions about
their lives without interference from the State. And what he next
says is, history "doesn't counsel abandonment, nor does it require
what the city is urging here"--cutting off the family right at the
first boundary, which is the nuclear family. He rejects that. In tak-
ing the position I have in all of my writings on this subject, I must
associate myself with Justice Powell's satements; otherwise, I could
not have written what I did. So I
   Senator HATCH. YOU mean with the position of Justice Powell?
  Judge GINSBURG. The position I have stated here. You asked me
how I justify saying that Roe (1973) has two underpinnings, the
equal dignity of the woman idea, and the personhood idea of indi-
vidual autonomy and decisionmaking. I point to those two decision
opinions as supplying the essential underpinning.
                                               272

  Senator HATCH. I understand, but at least--see, I differ with you
on using the 14th amendment to justify it. But at least you found
some constitutional underpinning. You would have written the
opinion so that at least there was a constitutional argument for the
right as you believe in it. And that I respect, even if I do disagree
with you on it.

  But, you know, some people would argue that the constitutional
right to contract is a fundamental right as well and that that right
can be interfered with just as much through substantive due proc-
ess as anything else. But in your view, does the generalized con-
stitutional right to privacy encompass, say, the following activi-
ties--because judges could decide this on their own because of their
own predilections. If they use a theory of substantive due process,
whatever they want to decide, regardless of what the language
says, regardless of the Constitution or the statutes or anything else
enacted by those elected to enact them say.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Hatch, I believe that it is healthy for
an academic or a judge to be exposed to criticism. You know that
my position, the position that I developed in this, I thought, sleeper
of a lecture, has been criticized from all sides. I have been criticized
for saying that legislators have any role in this. I have been criti-
cized for saying that the Court should not have solved it all in one
fell swoop. So I appreciate that I am never going to please all of
the people all of the time on this issue. I can only try to say what
my position is and be as open about it as I can.

  Senator HATCH. YOU have been, and I agree with that. As you
know, I admire you personally. But this is more important.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, I
would like, on a point of personal privilege

  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. This line of questioning I find to be
personally offensive, and I am very sorry to break the train of
thought and the demeanor of this committee. But I find it very dif-
ficult to sit here as the only descendent of a slave in this commit-
tee, in this body, and hear a defense, even an intellectual argu-
ment, that would suggest that there is a rationale, an intellectual
rationale, a legal rationale, for slavery that can be discussed in this
chamber at this time
  Senator HATCH. Well, Senator, Senator, that is
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, no, Senator, you just
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. Not what I said.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. YOU just a moment ago said that some
would say that there was a constitutional right to contract which
could not be impaired by a judicial decision.
  Senator HATCH. That has nothing to do with Dred Scott v. San-

ford.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. That was your statement, though, Sen-
ator, and I-

  SSeennaattoorr HMAOTSCEHLE. WY-BelRl,AiUf NI .cIanju- st submit, Senator Hatch--and we
have had a very fine relationship

  Senator HATCH. Oh, we do.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN [continuing]. Since I have been here,
and I have every respect for your intellect. I have every respect for
                                                273

your judgment. We may disagree on issues, but we have never had
occasion to be disagreeable. And I think, as a point of personal
privilege, it is very difficult for me to sit here and even to quietly
listen to a debate that would analogize Dred Scott and Roe v.
Wade. It is very, very difficult for me to listen to-

  Senator HATCH. Well, that is not what I am doing, so----
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN [continuing]. And so I want just to give
you my own sensitivity on this issue. That is why I asked as a
point of personal privilege that if there are questions going to the
current state of the law that are not as offensive that would elicit
the same kind of responses, or if there is some other way that you
can probe the judge's opinions on this area, I would very much, on
a personal level, appreciate that you take another approach.
  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, but just to make that clear--
then I would like to conclude, and I would appreciate taking a little
additional time. I have been attacking both of those cases and the
line of cases, both the Dred Scott v. Sanford case--there is no way
that anybody--I don't think anybody should misconstrue what I am
saying. I thought the Dred Scott case is the all-time worst case in
the history of the country. I think there are others that are bad,
but nothing that even approaches the offensiveness of that case.
  If the Senator has misconstrued what I am saying--and I think
you have--I apologize. But that isn't what I was saying.
  Also Lochner, I think that is a ridiculous case. My whole point
here is these are ridiculous cases and that they were conjured out
of thin air by this role of substantive due process.
  Now, whether I agree or disagree with Roe v. Wade, I still think
that approach toward judging is wrong. There is no question you
could have found constitutional underpinnings to have righted both
of those wrongs in those two cases. But nobody should misconstrue
what I am saying here into thinking that I am trying to find some
justification for slavery. My gosh, I wouldn't do that under any cir-
cumstances.
  So I certainly apologize if I haven't made myself clear, but I am
attacking this whole area of substantive due process which attacks
Dred Scott v. Sanford, where judges just conjure things out of thin
air to justify their own predilections or their own ideas of what the
law ought to be. So in that sense, I would certainly never offend
my dear friend--and we are good friends, and we work closely to-
gether, and I think we are going to do a lot of things around here
together. But I want to make that clear.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you. I
  Senator HATCH. Nor do I support Lochner because I raised the
issue--and that was in the context of Lochner--that there is a
right of contract mentioned in the law that is very, very important,
that some people think is fundamental. Lochner went way beyond
that by denying that the States had any rights to do what was in
the general welfare of the people. And I disagree with Lochner,and
I decry both of those cases.
  Now, let me just finish. Judge
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again--and I am delighted with your
statement, but let me just say that as part of the debate, as part
of the intellectual argument that you were engaging in with the
judge, you come back--you, in fact, did come back and say to her,
                                                274

well, there are some who would defend the right of contract in this
situation. And I am just saying to you that even listening to this
debate is very difficult to me, and on a point of personal
privilege

  Senator HATCH. I understand.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN [continuing]. If there is another way
that you can approach the criticism of judicial activism, I would ap-
preciate your taking it.
  Senator HATCH. Well, if you construed that to mean go back to
Sanford, that is wrong because that certainly wasn't meant. And
I apologize if I was inarticulate in what I was saying, but I don't
think I was.
  But let me just point out how important this is. When we have
the right in judges to just throw substantive due process or just de-
cide cases based upon their own ideas of what is right and wrong
rather than what is in the Constitution or is in the statute, we run
into these difficulties. You know, with regard to the generalized
constitutional right to privacy, does it encompass the following ac-
tivities or does it not?
  Let me just give you one illustration. Some people believe in a
right to privacy that would allow almost anything, say prostitution.
Let me note that in 1974, in a report to the U.S. Civil Rights Com-
mission, you wrote, Judge, "Prostitution as a consensual act be-
tween adults is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by re-
cent constitutional decisions." That is in "The Legal Status of
Women Under Federal Law" in 1972, I believe. You were citing
Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Roe v. Wade.
  You could push it farther. How about marijuana use in one's own
home? Is that a right to privacy that we should
  Judge GlNSBURG. I said "arguably." I said it has been argued
  Senator HATCH. I know. You were making an academic point. I
understand. I am not trying to indicate that you were justifying
prostitution. But the point is some people believe this right of pri-
vacy is so broad you can almost justify anything.
  Does it justify marijuana use in one's own home? Does it justify
physician-assisted suicide? Does it justify euthanasia? Does it jus-
tify homosexual marriage that some people think should happen
and shouldn't happen? Does it justify infanticide of newborn chil-
dren with birth defects?
  I use these examples in this hearing not to offer my own views
on any of these subjects, on whether or not they should be pro-
tected conduct, but it is my point that people who believe that such
conduct should be protected must, under the functioning of our sys-
tem, turn to the legislatures and not to the Federal courts to deter-
mine whether or not they should be protected.
  The point is that under an amorphous constitutional right of pri-
vacy, whether or not conduct is protected does not depend on any
neutral principle of adjudication, but on the subjective predilection
of the judge deciding the case. And that is not the rule of law. That
is government by judiciary.
  Let me just end by saying that with regard to the chairman's dis-
cussion yesterday or the day before of Dred Scott, the chairman
stated that he wishes that the Dred Scott Court had moved ahead
of the times to engage in progressive judicial activism--at least
                                              275

that is the way I interpreted it--rather than the reactionary judi-
cial activism that it did engage in. And I would simply like to point
out that judicial restraint would have led the Court to uphold the
Missouri Compromise. There was no need for and no justification
for judicial activism of any stripe. And rather than moving ahead
of the country, the Court need only have recognized the validity of
the law passed 37 years before its decision. And had it done so, we
wouldn't have had a substantive due process case or the disastrous
result that Dred Scott v. Sanford really was.

  The broader lesson, of course, is that there is no principled basis
for obtaining only the judicial activist results that one likes as a
judge. And to approve of substantive due process, which is nothing
more than a contradiction in terms to me, is to accept Dred Scott
and the Lochner line of cases. And more generally, the Constitution
is suited to a changing society, not because its provisions can be
made to mean whatever activist judges want them to mean, but be-
cause it leaves to the State legislatures and the Congress primary
authority to adapt laws to changing circumstances.

  Well, you could go on and on, but this is an important issue. And
I know that you understand it, and I just want you to think about
it because if we get to the point where judges just do whatever they
want to do and they ignore the statutes or the Constitution and the
laws as they are written and as they were originally meant to be
interpreted, then we wind up with no rule of law at all. And that
is the point that I am making.

  And I admit there are some fine lines where it is very difficult
to draw the line between when a judge is actively trying to resolve
a problem and when the judge is just doing it on their own volition.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator did--and I will accommodate other Senators, as
well--did go close to 50 minutes, but there was as continuous line
of questioning, and hopefully it means the next round will be a lot
shorter.
  We are about to have a vote, Judge, but I will start my ques-
tions. We will probably end up with a break here anywhere from
3 to 5 minutes into the questioning, and then I will resume it.
  We sometimes make statements over our long careers in the Sen-
ate that we either wish we didn't make or, although proud of hav-
ing made them, we are reminded of them at times. I am about to
engage in that.
  Senator Hatch, when Judge Souter was before us, and some were
pressing Justice Souter for a specific answer on an issue like the
death penalty, said:

  Judge Souter, I hope you will stand your ground, when you sincerely believe you
are being asked for answers which you clearly cannot provide and have the good
faith to be able to act as a Supreme Court Justice later. The Senate will not probe
into the particular views of a nominee on a particular issue or public policy, let
alone impose direct or indirect litmus tests on specific issues or cases. If it does, the
Senate impinges upon the independence of the judiciary. It politicizes the judging
function. The confirmation process becomes a means of influencing outcome.

  Now, I am sure having read that, I will have statements that I
made during the process read back to me. But I do think it is ap-
propriate to point out, Judge, that you not only have a right to
choose what you will answer and not answer, but in my view you
                                               276

should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue
that clearly is going to come before the Court in 50 different forms,
probably, over your tenure on the Court.

  So, I just want to inject what we never have in politics--consist-
ency. Then again, if we were consistent, it would be very dull.

  Let me move on. As a matter of fact, I have just been told the
vote--and I want to make sure my colleague from Illinois knows
it this time, I told her there is a vote--the vote has just begun, and
so I think this is an appropriate time to break. I will come back
with my round of questions. It will probably take us, as you have
probably observed by now, Judge, somewhere between 10 and 15
minutes to get over and vote and come back.

  So we will recess for whatever time it takes to get to the floor
and back.

  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge. I started to say in another context, when
you talk about the Madison lecture, welcome to the club of realiz-
ing that nothing you say will ever fully satisfy everyone. But now
you are in a new arena, where nothing you say will satisfy the
same person twice, even if you say the same thing twice.
  I find the press fascinating and I love them, and this will get
their attention.
  When a former Justice was before us, I asked a number of tedi-
ous questions about natural law, because this particular Justice
has written a great deal on natural law, all the press wrote articles
about how tedious and boring it was.
  After he got on the Court, one of the leading newspapers in
America ran a long article about why didn't we ask more about
natural law. Part of the problem is the press is like us, they some-
times don't understand the substance of issues.
  So the good news is your nomination has not been controversial.
The bad news is that if it is not controversial, then we will discuss
other things. I just want to point out that I am flattered that the
press noticed I comb my hair a different way, which is a major
issue these days. I would be happy to have a press conference on
that and give you all advice later on how to do that, if you would
like.
  But it is a fascinating undertaking, and so I can assure you that
when you finish, as brilliant as you are, you will not be satisfying
to anyone all the time, let alone all the people all the time. But I
think you are doing a brilliant job.
  Let me point out--and my colleague is, as we say in this busi-
ness, necessarily absent as I speak. As a matter of fact, I can see
him at this moment being interviewed. So I am not going to take
the time to wait until he returns to make the statement I am about
to make, although I say this not as a criticism to him.
  I would indicate that, historically, I think you have laid out very
clearly from the outset the basis upon which the right of privacy
has been found to exist under our Constitution. Because the first
question you answered, you talked about the liberty clause; you
talked about the ninth amendment; you talked about the common
law and the common-law traditions.
                                               277

  I would point out to my colleague that there has, in fact, with
a notable aberration period in our history, always been a distinc-
tion in the common law, as well as constitutional interpretation,
between the degree of protection and the wide berth that matters
relating to personal privacy and property have been treated, espe-
cially the last 50 years. There have been distinctions historically
made in terms of how the Court approaches the degree of protec-
tion warranted in those areas, and in terms of how and under what
circumstances government can interfere with either of those rights,
one's personal private rights and one's property rights.

  I would like to pursue a little bit--I didn't intend on going in
quite this direction, but in light of the line of questioning, which
I think was appropriate, the line of questioning of my colleagues
just had--I would like to discuss with you the issue of unenum-
erated rights, particularly the right to privacy.

  The right to privacy recognized by the Court includes such
things, as you have mentioned, as the right to marry free from gov-
ernment interference. And in response to one of the best columnists
in the country who says we repeat things all the time, part of the
reason we repeat things all the time is an attempt to educate peo-
ple a little bit. Most Americans, I have found in surveys, if you ask
them if I can marry whom I want, they will say "yes". If you say
what right do you have for that, they say the Constitution guaran-
tees it.

  Nowhere in the Constitution is the word "marry" mentioned; no-
where in the Constitution is the right to marry mentioned. There
is nowhere in the Constitution where the right of a married couple
to use birth control is mentioned, but Americans think that it is.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Are you arguing that a brother has a right
to marry a sister?

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am arguing that the right to marriage is
one that is a right of privacy that most Americans think is con-
stitutionally guaranteed, and only under exceptional circumstances
can the State interfere with your choice of who you want to marry.
They have to be able to prove there is some overwhelming reason
for their interfering with your right to marry. That is why they call
it a fundamental right.

  Now, that test has been met in the minds of the courts, when
you say I wish to marry my brother or my sister. There is an over-
whelming reason why the State can prohibit that, an overwhelming
State interest. But it is a fundamental right, and most Americans
think it is written into the Constitution. Most Americans think, as
they should, that that is something that is a fundamental right.

  Just like what happened--and I will get back to this, Senator,
in light of the understandable interruption--when the States used
to come along and say, hey, white folks can't marry black folks. The
Court went, wait a minute, what's the rationale for that? Why can't
white folks marry black folks or black folks marry white folks--the
so-called antimiscegenation laws. The Court said, hey, wait a
minute, that doesn't make any sense.

  I am confusing a little bit right to privacy and some of these is-
sues, but I don't want to--in a generic sense, the answer to your
question, Senator, is they have to have an overwhelming reason to
interfere with certain of our rights of privacy.
                                                278

  So the right to make decisions about how to raise and educate
one's children free from government interference has been recog-
nized by the courts. You told Senator Leahy, Judge, that there is
a constitutional right to privacy. I think that is what you said to
him, which you described as "the right to make basic decisions
about one's life course"--well stated, well articulated, and similarly
articulated by other Justices whose ranks you are about to join.

  But I was as little unsure from your answer to Senator Leahy's
question about how strong you thought that right of privacy was.
The Supreme Court has recognized these rights about marriage,
child rearing, and family, and when they have, they have generally
referred to them--and I think in all those three areas--as fun-
damental rights.

  As you and I both know, when the Court uses the word "fun-
damental," it is a term of art as they use it. Now, there usually
is a need to make a distinction, when in the law there is a dif-
ference between fundamental rights and other kinds of rights and
how the courts look at them. This means that the Government
must have an extraordinary or compelling justification for interfer-
ing with a personal decision of the lands I have mentioned.

  Now, when Senator Leahy asked you about the right to privacy,
you first agreed with the statement that the Government could not
interfere with that right, absent a very compelling reason. But you
then went on to say that the Government "just needs a reason."
There is a big difference, as you know, between the two, just need-
ing any old reason and needing a compelling reason. The Govern-
ment has reason for almost any action they take, a compelling rea-
son for only a few of the actions that we take.

  Now, it may have been just a semantic difference. But what I
want to go back to, having read the record, is do you agree that
the right of privacy is fundamental, meaning that it is so impor-
tant--I am not asking about any specific rights of privacy--mean-
ing that it is so important, that the Government may interfere with
it only for compelling reasons, when it finds that such a right ex-
ists, the right of privacy?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The line of cases that you just outlined, the
right to marry, the right to procreate or not, the right to raise one's
children, the degree of justification the State must have to interfere
with those rights is large.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is what I thought you meant, but there was
a line in your response that you have now clarified for me. I am
not pressing you about other rights, unfounded, unrecognized, ar-
guably existing. I am not asking you about those. I am not asking
you about consensual homosexual marriages or anything else. I am
just dealing with the line of cases that have already been decided
on procreation, in this case the Griswold case, starting with it, and
family decisions and the like. I am not pressing you to where you
are going to go from here. I just wanted to make sure I understood
you viewed these cases as requiring a compelling government rea-
son.

  Judge GlNSBURG. You mentioned Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and
Piercev. Society of Sisters (1925). Although pigeonholed in the free
exercise of religion area, I would put the Yoder (1972) case in that
same line.
                                      279
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree with you. Again, the reason I raised this
is that at least two of the last five Justices who have come before
us have argued that either the right does not exist, should not
exist, that the Court made incorrect decisions in that line of cases,
or that if it exists, it is not a fundamental right. And that is why
I am pursuing this, to make sure I understood what your answer
was. I now understand it.
  Now, another critical question concerning the method you would
use to determine whether or not personal decisions are included
within the zone of decisions protected by the right of privacy has
been raised by my friend from Utah. He indicates there is no prin-
cipled means by which one could find a right to privacy, a notion
I strongly disagree with, from the standpoint of legal scholarship.
There is a principled rationale that has been employed to find the
right to privacy.
  But there is a debate that exists. I am not going to ask you about
how you decide any specific case, but I would like to determine
where you are, in a general sense, in this debate over the meth-
odology that should be employed to determine in the first instance
whether or not there is a principled reason for finding a right of
privacy in the Constitution.
  Now, Judge Scalia, a brilliant jurist who you know well, who ap-
parently wants to be on an island with you somewhere [laugh-
ter].
  By the way, please note in the record that people laughed. That
was
  Judge GlNSBURG. Compared to what. He didn't say I would be
his first or second choice. He said compared to what. He was given
a tightly circumscribed choice.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, if I had to be on an island with a man for
any extended period of time, I might pick Judge Scalia. The reason
I would, sincerely, is I think he is brilliant, I think he is dead
wrong most of the time, as he thinks I am, and it would be, as an-
other nominee who came before us once said, when asked why he
wanted to be on the Court, it would be an intellectual feast.
  A slight digression: I had a conversation with Justice Scalia after
you had been nominated, to tell him that I was about to say in an
interview the vote I most regretted casting out of all the ones I
ever cast was voting for him, because he was so effective. He said
what are you doing now? I said I am teaching a course in constitu-
tional law at Widener University. He said, oh, my God, I had better
come and tell them the truth. [Laughter.]
  So I am sure he would have an opportunity to educate me, if we
were on an island together.
  Having said that, Justice Scalia, on a very serious note, has of-
fered one method, a methodology to determine whether or not a
right of privacy, a personal right that is not enumerated, not men-
tioned in the Constitution, warrants constitutional protection. And
he has written that the only interests protected by the liberty
clause of the 14th amendment are those interests which are de-
fined in the most narrow and specific terms, where historical safe-
guards from government interference have existed.
  Now, as you know better than I do--again, at the expense of of-
fending my brethren in the press, I am going to be very fundamen-

     75-974 O - 94 -- 10
                                                   280

tal about this, to use a phrase from another context--when in the
past we determined whether or not fundamental rights of privacy
exist, one of the things they go back and do, as courts have done,
is look at history. They say what have we done in the past, as a
people, what has our country done, what has our English jurispru-
dential system recognized, not only here in the States, but in Eng-
land, in the common law? And they look back at that as one of the
guideposts, not the only one, not necessarily determinative, but
that is what they have done.

  I think, by inference, Justice Scalia acknowledges that is an ap-
propriate method, at least a starting point to determine whether or
not an unenumerated right should be recognized as protected by
the Constitution.

  So Justice Scalia says that when you go back, determining
whether or not there is an interest protected by the liberty clause
of the 14th amendment, you go back and look at those interests de-
fined in their most narrow and specific terms. So the question for
Justice Scalia, in deciding whether the Constitution protects a par-
ticular liberty, including a particular privacy interest, is whether
years and years ago the Government recognized that precise spe-
cific interest.

  Now, that approach of Justice Scalia, which was outlined by him
in the Michael H. case, that approach is very different from an-
other that I would characterize as the traditional approach for de-
termining whether or not these unenumerated rights that we have
recognized exist.

  The traditional approach, in my view, looks to whether the Con-
stitution expresses a commitment to a more general interest, and
then asks how that commitment should be applied in our time to
a specific situation. The difference between these two approaches
can make all the difference in the world on where a Justice comes
out on the finding of whether such a right exists or doesn't.

  For example, under Justice Scalia's approach, the right to marry
someone of a different race is not protected by the Constitution, at
least arguably, based on things he has said, because the right to
marry is nowhere specifically mentioned in the Constitution. And
when you go back to look at whether or not--which is one of the
methods used by all Justices to determine whether or not there is
an unenumerated right that should be protected--when you go
back in history and look, there is no place you can say that, under
our English jurisprudential system, our courts or the English
courts have traditionally recognized the specific right of blacks and
whites to marry. And since you can't find that back there, then the
right doesn't exist.

  Whereas, in footnote 6, for example, as you well know, although
Justices Kennedy and O'Connor agreed with the overall finding on
that case--which I won't bother you with the facts, which you know
well and are not particularly relevant to my point--they said we
dissent from the methodology used by Justice Scalia in arising at
a decision, which is the right decision--my words--but for the
wrong reason. And they said you go back and you look at the gen-
eral proposition of whether or not the general interest seeking pro-
tection under the Constitution is in fact one we have historically
protected.
                                      281
  So they say when you go back, you should look at whether we
historically protected the right and recognized the right of individ-
uals to marry who they want to marry. So you go back and, de-
pending on what question you ask, you get a different answer. If
you go back and say, OK, we will recognize--and I am
oversimplifying--we are going to recognize, determine whether or
not antimiscegenation laws are constitutional, and the basis on
which they are being challenged is I have a privacy right to marry
who I want to marry, so let's see if that right is protected by the
Constitution.
  Scalia's approach, you go back and look at all the history and
say, hey, there is no place where blacks and whites were protected.
But if you used the O'Connor approach, you go back and say have
we recognized the right to marry? You say yes, we have done that,
ergo, we can say, using that methodology of looking at the general
proposition, there may be a principled rationale to acknowledge or
recognize the right to marry a black man or a white woman or a
white man or a black woman, that may fall within the domain of
my right of privacy guaranteed by the Constitution.
  Senator HATCH. Would you yield just for a second on that point?
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to finish just this line, so I don't con-
fuse anybody.
  Senator HATCH. I just want to mention that I really don't think
Justice Scalia would fail to find, under the 14th amendment protec-
tion clause, that Loving v. Virginia is the correct decision.
  The CHAIRMAN. A valid point.
  Senator HATCH. I don't think he would have had the
interpretation
  The CHAIRMAN. He may have come up with the exact same deci-
sion of saying that it would, in fact, be inappropriate and unconsti-
tutional for the State of Virginia to have such a law. But he would
not have found it, if you used his methodology, because that is
where the right of privacy has most often been found by the courts
since Pierce.
  Now, in contrast, as I said, under the more traditional approach
recognizing unenumerated rights, the courts ask no$ whether the
legal system historically had protected interracial marriages, but
whether the legal system historically had protected the institution
of marriage generally. Because it had, because our legal system
long had understood the importance of family integrity and inde-
pendence, the Court held in Loving v. Virginia that the particular
right to marry someone of another race is also protected.
  Now, in thinking about how the Constitution protects un-
enumerated rights, including rights of privacy, will you use--I am
not asking you where you are going to come out on any issue, but
will you use the methodology that looks to going back to a specific
right being sought, guaranteed, or will you use the more traditional
method of more broadly looking at the right that is attempting,
seeking constitutional protection before the Court? What methodol-
ogy will you use? What role will history and tradition play for you
in determining whether or not a right exists that is not enumer-
ated?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Mr. Chairman, if I understand your question
correctly, including the exchange between you and Senator Hatch,
                                      282
if you are asking whether I would have subscribed to both parts
of Loving (1967)--that is, both the equal protection and due
process

  The CHAIRMAN. NO. Let me be very clear. I don't care about Lov-
ing. I was using Loving as an illustration as to how you would ar-
rive at a different decision depending on which methodology. I am
asking you very specifically

  Judge GlNSBURG. Loving was the case Justice O'Connor used
  The CHAIRMAN. Illustrate.
  Judge GlNSBURG. To distinguish her position from the position
Justice Scalia took in the Michael H. (1989) case. That case, as you
know, had nothing to do with the issue raised in Loving. The con-
troversy centered on a footnote in the Court's opinion, in Justice
Scalia's opinion, a footnote added to the opinion in response to the
dissent. The footnote was rather long, as I remember--it is not in
front of me. The note appears at least to Associate Justice Scalia
with a first step that some people wouldn't take; that is, he ap-
pears to recognize the existence of an unenumerated right. Then
the question is: How does one define that right? He is not saying
there are no unenumerated rights.
  I have a colleague who has written a wonderfully amusing arti-
cle, which I think he means us to take seriously. It is an article
by my chief judge, Abner Mikva. It says, "Good-bye to Footnotes."
And perhaps
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, the footnote here, Judge, is irrelevant. Let's
just put it all aside. I am just using that as an illustration. The
debate among people today in your business is: What principled ra-
tionale do you use in determining whether or not, under the liberty
clause of the 14th amendment, a privacy right exists?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Biden, I have stated in response to
Senator Hatch that I associate myself with the dissenting opinion
in Poe v. Ullman (1961), the method revealed most completely by
Justice Harlan in that opinion. The next best statement of it ap-
pears in Justice Powell's opinion in Moore v. City of EastCleveland
(1977).
  My understanding of the O'Connor/Kennedy position in the Mi-
chael H. case is that they, too, associate themselves with that posi-
tion. Justice O'Connor cited the dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ull-
man as the methodology she employs. She cited Loving as her rea-
son for not associating herself with the footnote, the famous foot-
note 6 in Justice Scalia's Michael H. opinion, a footnote in which
two Justices concurred. That is about all I can say on that subject.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I think that answers the question. It seems
to me that based on what you have said, you believe the more tra-
ditional principled rationale for arriving at whether or not such a
right exists as it relates to the use of historical precedent is the one
that you would use, rather than very narrowly speaking to a very
specific right to determine whether or not it was protected.
  Now, I have used up 15 minutes. When I come back, I can tell
you, I want to move from that to talk about the Chevron case and
what methodology you use in terms of deciding--and it is a dif-
ferent issue there. It is legislative intent that is going to be the
issue, and what deference is given to it. I know we have raised
                                               283

questions about that before, but I would like to nail down a few
more points.

  I appreciate your answer, and I am not going to go beyond the
15 minutes. I will now yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

  Senator COHEN. Does that mean I am precluded from raising
that issue before it comes back to you, the Chevronissue?

   The CHAIRMAN. Not at all. Not at all.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. You
asked for an indication of time. I would expect to use the full 30
minutes.

  Judge Ginsburg, I begin by expressing my own concern about the
scope of the answers. The chairman said that he wished you would
have answered a little more. I would join Senator Biden in that.
I appreciate the fact that you have to make your own judgment as
to what you will answer.

  My own reading of the prior nominees has been that, as a gen-
eral rule, there were more answers. Some answered less. Justice
Scalia answered virtually nothing.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is why I would like to be on an island with
him. [Laughter.]

  Senator SPECTER. He is a very engaging gentleman and a squash
player, and I haven't yet been able to persuade him to do that. But
when he was before this panel, I think Senator Biden is correct
that he answered much less than you have.

  You will not find any quotations from me in the record about
praising nominees before our panel, and this is the eighth occasion
I have been a party to them--praising nominees for not answering
questions. I read one of your articles, and as you know, I wrote to
you because you had commented that you believed the committee
had crossed the line with Judge Bork in questions we asked. I
wrote to you and asked for some examples, and I can understand
your being too busy to give them.

  My own observations have been that nominees answer about as
many questions as they have to for confirmation, and I think that
Chief Justice Rehnquist, for example, came back and answered
some questions. It was a 65-33 vote. The tenor of these hearings
has been very laudatory from this side of the bench, and I would
join in that, as I said, about your academic and professional and
judicial career. So that I don't think there is any doubt about your
nomination not being in any jeopardy, but I would just add my
voice to those who have commented about an appreciation on our
side for more information.

  When I asked the question about the death penalty yesterday, I
tried to articulate it in as gentle a way as possible. I would not ask
you, as Senator Hatch did--and he had every right to ask, and you
had every right to decline--about issues moving toward how cases
might be decided and whether you agreed with Justices Marshall
and Brennan on capital punishment being cruel and unusual pun-
ishment in violation of the eighth amendment.

  But I think that capital punishment is sort of a landmark issue
on law enforcement, its deterrent effect and its ability to be a bea-
con, so to speak. That is one of the areas where I would have ap-
preciated a little more.
                                      284

  I mention those comments to you at the outset because I think
it is important, and this is obviously going to be an area where
there are going to be lots of differences of opinion, not only with
you today but with the nominees who will follow.

  Let me now move to the substantive area that I consider to be
very important, and that is the role of the Court on refereeing dis-
putes between the President and the Congress on the War Powers
Act issue, about which you wrote a concurring opinion in Sanchez-
Espinoza v. PresidentReagan.

  The issue of the gulf war was very problemsome, and President
Bush asserted very late into December 1990 the intent to move into
a conflict with Iraq over Kuwait without congressional approval.
The leadership in the Congress stated their intention not to bring
the matter to the floor. It was in a very unusual procedural setting
where we had swearing-ins on January 3, and Senator Harkin of
Iowa brought the issue up in a way which I think forced the hand
of the leadership, and the issue did come up and we did have a
vote on the resolution for the use of power.

  Let me move to your concurring opinion in Sanchez-Espinoza, as
the fastest way to get into the issue and into a dialog, where you
said that you:

  would dismiss the War Powers claim for relief asserted by congressional plaintiffs
as not ripe for judicial review. The judicial branch should not decide issues affecting
the allocation of power between the President and Congress until the political lead-
ers reach a constitutional impasse. Congress has formidable weapons at its disposal:
the power of the purse and investigative resources far beyond those available in the
third branch.

  I would suggest to you, Judge Ginsburg, that the power of the
purse is not very helpful if the President goes into Kuwait without
authorization from Congress were the Congress to cut off his fund-
ing. It obviously can't be done when fighting men and women are
at risk.

  And when you talk about the investigate resources far beyond
those available in the third branch, I don't believe that our inves-
tigative resources, which are customarily very important, really
bear on this issue.

  If we are to have a resolution between the Congress and the
President, where we have a Korean war without a declaration of
war, we have a Vietnam war without a declaration of war, and we
have an issue about a violation of the War Powers Act in El Sal-
vador as the issue came before your court, how can this dispute of
enormous constitutional proportion be decided unless the Court
will take jurisdiction and decide it?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, in that case, in the portion
you read, I said that the question was not ripe for our review.

  Senator SPECTER. I did.
  Judge GINSBURG. It is a position developed far more extensively
than in the abbreviated statement I made in theSanchez-Espinoza
(1985) case. The principal exponent was my colleague, Carl
McGowan. He wrote persuasively on congressional standing and
the concept of ripeness for review. His position was essentially
adopted by Justice Powell in Goldwater v. Carter (1979). That case
concerned the termination of the Taiwan Defense Treaty.
                                               285

  Senator SPECTER. It was Justice Powell who just had a single
line: "Although I agree with the result reached by the Court, I
would dismiss the complaint as not ripe for judicial review." But
I do not believe that either the Supreme Court or the circuit
court--and the circuit had it in Crockettv. Reagan--hasever really
dealt with the issue.

  I tried with Justice Souter, asked him if he thought the Korean
war was a war. I answered the question in the question, because
I think the Korean war was a war, and he said he would have to
think about it. I said, "I am going to ask you the next round," and
over the weekend he came back. I said, "Have you thought about
it?" And he said, "Yes, I have." And I said, "Well, was the Korean
war a war?" And he said, "I don't know."

  I think this is a matter that we really ought to explore with a
nominee--standing, ripeness. You have written expansively and I
have admired your work on standing. I think that the Court dis-
misses too many cases on the standing issue. But isn't the Supreme
Court there really to referee big, big issues? It is harder to have
a bigger issue than the constitutional authority of the Congress to
declare war or whether the President exceeds the War Powers Act
if we don't come to you. And we can hardly come to you when the
troops are in the field.

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, the question for me was: Who
is the "we"? I have not ruled out the ultimate justiciability of a
question of the kind you have raised. What I said was that I associ-
ate myself with the position taken by Justice Powell, and in both
decisions and law review articles by Carl McGowan, the position
that legislators must stand up and be counted in their own House
before they can come to court. If Congress puts itself in conflict
with the Executive by passing a resolution, by a majority of both
Houses, saying we, the Congress, take the position that the Execu-
tive is acting in opposition to our will, at that point I could not say
there isn't a ripe controversy. But unless and until that occurs, I
have taken the position--whether it is Republican Senators or
Democratic Senators--that no ripe controversy exists between Con-
gress and the Executive. The controversy ripens only when legisla-
tors who oppose to the Executive's position win in their own
branch. Until that point is reached, in my view, there is no justici-
able controversy between the two branches of government.

  The President is a unitary. The President takes a position. For
Congress to take a position, Congress must act by majority vote.
I do not think a group of Senators can come to court and ask the
third branch to resolve a clash between the legislative and the ex-
ecutive branches. That is my position on ripeness. I have stated
that position in an abbreviated way in Sanchez-Espinoza (1985).
Others take different positions. Members of my court have taken
other positions.

  As I see it, there must be a majority vote in Congress before the
Executive and the Congress can have a controversy ripe for court
to review. If a group of legislators does not prevail in Congress,
that group cannot come to court for resolution of a clash that, in
my mind, does not exist until it becomes the position of the Con-
gress.

  That is about all I can say, Senator Specter, on that subject.
                                                286

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, do you believe that the Ko-
rean war was a war?

  Judge GINSBURG. That is the kind of question on which you
might ask a law teacher to expound. If you are asking me how I
would rule as a judge--and you are considering me to be a judge,
not a legislator--I would have to say the Korean conflict was a
complex operation. If I were presented with the record, the briefs,
the arguments, I would be required to make a decision on it on the
basis of what the parties present to me. I am afraid I can't do any
better than Justice Souter did on that question.

  The job for which you are considering me is the job of a judge,
and a judge has no business expounding on a question like that
apart from the record, the briefs, the presentations of the parties.
We do have a great attachment in our system of justice to the prin-
ciple of party presentation. Judges in our system are not inquisi-
torial. They do not take over the proceedings and pursue what they
will. Senator Hatch reminded me of that very forcefully. Very dear
to our system of procedure is the principle of party, not judicial,
presentations.

  I can't answer the question about the Korean war off the top of
my head. If I were confronted with it as a judge in a case where
the issue was justiciable, I would make my decision on the basis
of the record, the briefs, and the arguments before me; out of that
setting I am not prepared to answer the question.

  Senator SPECTER. May I respectfully suggest, Judge Ginsburg,
that a question as to whether the Korean conflict was a war does
not come within the confines of justiciable issues where briefs are
required and oral argument is required on a narrowly focused mat-
ter. As a matter of common life experience, people have a view as
to whether the Korean conflict, involving thousands of people with
a lot of military action, was or was not a war.

  In citing the Korean conflict, I cite something which is not going
to come before the Court, and I would expect that that would be
the kind of a question where at least we could get some idea as
to your life experience and your general approach to a matter of
some magnitude, but I am not going to press it.

  Let me move to another issue. I have been very much concerned
about the Supreme Court functioning as a super legislature. As I
said earlier, I am very much concerned about the issue of judicial
activism, and would cite two cases where the Court acted as a revi-
sionist Court. The Griggs decision was handed down in 1971 on a
matter involving the Civil Rights Act, and then Ward's Cove came
along in 1989 and, in my view, overruled Griggs. Congress changed
that and returned to Griggs with the Civil Rights Act of 1991. .

  Senator Kennedy asked you earlier today if you agreed with the
decision of the Supreme Court in one of those series of cases, and
I am going to have to recheck the record to see if that was really
answered. But the case I want to take up with you is the case of
Rust v. Sullivan, and the concern that I have here is with an activ-
ist-revisionist Court which is going to make new law.

  Rust v. Sullivan is the gag rule case, and that involved a situa-
tion where the provisions of the Public Health Services Act of 1970
relating to counseling on planned parenthood, was passed in 1970,
and a regulation was promulgated in 1971 that there could be
                                         287

counseling on abortion issues. Then in 1988, the Secretary of
Health and Human Services issued a new regulation to the con-
trary, that there could not be counseling. Even though the earlier
regulation had stood for some 17 years, Congress had not acted to
alter it, strongly suggesting congressional approval of the regula-
tion.

  Then in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld to new reg-
ulation, pointing out, among other things, that the new regulation
was "in accord with the shift in attitude against the elimination of
the unborn children by abortion." I was surprised to see the Court
rest its opinion in part on a shift in attitude, shift in public opin-
ion, to come out with a new regulation.

  My question to you, as this is now a decided issue, do you agree
with the Supreme Court's judgment in Rust v. Sullivan?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Specter, remind me of the prior history
of that case. It was a question, was it not, of the deference due to
the Health and Human Services

  Senator SPECTER. That was a factor in the case, on the deference
due a regulation promulgated by the executive branch, but within
the context where there had previously been a contrary regulation,
which had been in existence for 17 years, and no congressional ac-
tion to change it during that time.

  Judge GlNSBURG. You said that you were going to check to see
what my answer was about Griggs (1971) and Ward's Cove(1989).
I hope I have been consistent in saying I think that the court, my
court, and the Supreme Court, endeavored to determine what Con-
gress meant. Griggs, was a unanimous decision authored by Chief
Justice Burger, was it not?

  Senator SPECTER. It was.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And wasn't Ward's Covea divided decision?
  Senator SPECTER. Five-to-four.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And then Congress said what it meant. I gave
some other examples of such congressional clarification or correc-
tion. But I am uncomfortable about inquiries concerning how I
would cast my vote in a particular case. I will address and explain,
to the extent I am able, any vote I have cast. But you are raising
a question about--one of your colleagues said he would inquire
about Chevron (1984) deference and ask what that means to me.
  I will confess I am the judge who wrote the decision that was re-
versed in Chevron.I regard Chevron as stating a canon of construc-
tion, which Congress is at liberty to say it doesn't want applied. I
don't want to sit here before this committee, however, and write
the opinion I would have written in the Rust v. Sullivan case.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, I am not asking you about
Chevron. The specific case that Senator Kennedy asked you about
I believe was Patterson, and in response to his question about
whether you agreed with the opinion--and I believe it was Patter-
son--he said since they won't come back, you responded about--I
don't believe you answered his question--you responded about the
Congress changing the law on title VII cases applying to sex dis-
crimination, and then about the Goldman case.
  But I have moved away from Patterson and I haven't brought up
Chervon, and the decision involving the gag rule, Rust v. Sullivan,
is an example of a revisionist Court, in my opinion. It is a decided
                                      288
case. What is the problem, on a matter which has been litigated
and is finished, in having a Senator on the Judiciary Committee
ask a nominee for the Supreme Court whether that case was cor-
rectly decided? It is a finished matter. Just as Senator Kennedy
asked you about Patterson this morning, as he put it, the case
won't come back.

  Judge GINSBURG. It isn't clear to me, Senator, that the case won't
come back, simply because we have a different regulation now. The
gag rule was withdrawn in the very first week of this new adminis-
tration. But it isn't far-fetched to think the rule could return in an-
other administration.

  Again, I sense that I am in the position of a skier at the top of
that hill, because you are asking me how I would have voted in
Rust v. Sullivan (1991). Another member of this committee would
like to know how I might vote in that case or another one. I have
resisted descending that slope, because once you ask me about this
case, then you will ask me about another case that is over and
done, and another case. So I believe I must draw the line at the
cases I have decided.

  You asked about my statement in Sanchez-Espinosa, and I an-
swered that question. If you inquire about something I have writ-
ten, or an authority on which I have relied, I will do my best to
respond. But if you ask how I would have voted on an issue that
can come back, I must abstain. I can address an issue or case that
is never going to come before the Court again--Dred Scott, for ex-
ample, a decision I said was wrong for all times.

  The issue in Rust is one that may come back. You can't rule it
out, any more than I can. You can say for now the gag rule has
been removed, the President removed it in his very first week in
office. But it was put in place by the prior administration. I can't
rule out the possibility that another administration will put the
gag rule back. If I address the question here, if I tell this legisla-
tive chamber what my vote would be, then my position as a judge
could be compromised. And that is the extreme discomfort I am
feeling at the moment. You are asking me to tell you how I would
vote on a case you call over and gone, one that can't come up again.
I know the case is not going to come up again in the next 4 years.
I can't see beyond that. I know that

  Senator SPECTER. HOW about 8 years? [Laughter.]
  Judge GINSBURG. I am not going to predict the result of the next
election, any more than you are, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, do you agree with the deci-
sions of the Supreme Court in the 1930's, when the Supreme Court
of the United States invalidated a whole series of congressional en-
actments on the New Deal, on the ground of substantive due proc-
ess? Do you agree with those decisions?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, I think that line of authority
has been so discredited by so many Supreme Court decisions, that
if anything is well established, it is well established that the
Lochner era is over. One cannot say of a recent 5-to-4 decision what
one can say about the repudiation of the Lochner line of cases.
  Senator SPECTER. Good. Now that we are finished with the thir-
ties, we can move into the forties.
                                      289
  Judge Ginsburg, do you think that Congress has the authority to
take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United
States to decide the constitutionality of issues under the equal pro-
tection clause of the 14th amendment?
  Judge GINSBURG. YOU are asking me, what if Congress decided
to do that, and if it were challenged in court--I don't think Con-
gress has ever done that, right?
  Senator SPECTER. EX Parte McCardle dealt with that right after
the Civil War.
  Judge GINSBURG. There is McCardle (1869) and there is Klein
(1872), and I don't think there is much more. If Congress were ever
to do what your question hypothesizes, there would almost cer-
tainly be a challenge and it would almost certainly come before the
Court. I can recite the names of the cases that exist, but I can't
say anything beyond that. Any further statement would not be in
the best interests of the Supreme Court.
thaStenyoatuoragSrPeEeCdTwERit.hDMidarybouuraynvs.wMera--diIsobnel1i?eve you did yesterday--
  Judge GINSBURG. I believe
  Senator SPECTER. I don't ask that question lightly, because some
don't.
  Judge GINSBURG. I believe the institution of judicial review for
constitutionality is well established--I think I expressed myself to
that effect yesterday. It is a hallmark of this Nation that our courts
exercise that function.
  We have served as a model for the world in that regard. After
World War II, a number of states that never had the institution of
judicial review for constitutionality looked to our system as a
model. Yes, I feel comfortable that I am not doing any damage to
the Supreme Court or the Federal judiciary by saying I believe
Marbury v. Madison (1803) is here to stay.
  Senator SPECTER. The time goes fast when I am questioning,
maybe more slowly for you, Judge Ginsburg. The red light is on.
If I may just pursue this for a moment or two more, Mr. Chairman.
  Marbury v. Madison established the supremacy of the Supreme
Court to decide the constitutionality of issues, and there are some
up to this moment who dispute that. I asked you the question
about whether Congress can take away the power of the Supreme
Court to decide the constitutionality of issues under the equal pro-
tection clause of the 14th amendment, because you are the fore-
most champion of that clause.
  But when you declined to answer that question, the thought oc-
curs how do you have inviolate Supreme Court standing to decide
constitutional issues, if the Congress can take away the authority
of the Supreme Court to decide it, take away the jurisdiction.
  When Justice Rehnquist was up for confirmation for Chief Jus-
tice, I asked him the question as to whether the Congress could
take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and he declined
to answer. Overnight, one of the staffers found an article written
by Chief Justice Rehnquist in 1958. It was in the Harvard Law
Record. He was then William H. Rehnquist, no titles.
  In that article, Mr. Rehnquist criticized the Judiciary Committee
for not asking Justice Whittaker, a nominee, important questions
on due process. I said to him the next morning, I said this article
                                      290
was found by staff and this is what you said in 1958, and he had
a great answer. He said, "I was wrong." Then I pursued the ques-
tion, with some tenacity, perhaps, and he finally answered the
question. He said the Court could not be stripped of jurisdiction in
first amendment cases.

  I then asked him what about fourth amendment cases. He said
I am not going to answer that. How about fifth amendment cases,
due process, right to counsel? No, I am not going to answer. Sixth
amendment? I asked him what's the difference between saying the
Court can't be stripped of jurisdiction in the first amendment, but
you won't answer as to the fourth, fifth and sixth? I said I am not
going to answer that, either. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I have a feeling your tenacity is not
likely to be rewarded with this Judge.

  Senator SPECTER. Don't bet on it, Mr. Chairman.
  My final question to you, Judge Ginsburg, for this round is how
can your granddaughters have the protection of equal protection
under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, and my
granddaughters, too, if the Congress can take away the jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court of the United States to decide those issues?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, so far I have only one grand-
daughter.
  Senator SPECTER. Just wait.
  Judge GINSBURG. I am hopeful. I never said the Congress could.
I haven't got the case before me. Chief Justice Marshall, in
Marbury v. Madison (1803), said you start with the case. As Madi-
son said, before the courts can do anything, they must have a case
of a judiciary nature. Then Chief Justice Marshall said, when I
have a case, I must apply the law to it, and the highest law in the
land is the Constitution. That fundamental law trumps other laws.
But judges do not apply the Constitution to abstract questions. I
am bound by the case, I must decide the case, that is where a judge
gets his or her authority to expound on anything from, from what
article III says, from a case or controversy, a case of a justifiable
nature.
  If I may, I do want to emphasize what I hope I have made clear
to you, because I do not want to be misunderstood as having criti-
cized this committee. In the article that you read, I confess to an
ambiguity. The sentence I wrote was, "The distinction between ju-
dicial philosophy and votes in particular cases blurred as the ques-
tions and answers wore on." I would like to clarify that I was not
criticizing this committee. Far from it. I appreciate now more than
ever how difficult it is for the responder to maintain that line and
not pass beyond it into forecasting or giving hints about votes in
particular cases. I was speaking of the vulnerable responder, not
the committee that asked the questions.
  I might also say, on your question concerning the word "war," it
depends on the context. Are you asking about the power of Con-
gress to declare war, or are you speaking in lay terms? I can recite
wise counsel that has always shored me up. What a word means
depends on the context in which it is used.
  That you define a word one way in one context doesn't nec-
essarily mean that you should define that word the same way in
every other context. The notion that you should, said a great law
                                      291
professor, Walter Wheeler Cook, "has all the tenacity of original sin
and must constantly be guarded against." So that is what I was
guarding against by not answering the question, was the Korean
conflict a war. I must ask in what context are you asking that
question, are you asking me to decide whether the Executive, in
that affair, violated the Constitution, which gives Congress the
power to declare war?

  Senator SPECTER. I thank you for your answers, Judge Ginsburg.
I will return to the issue of war on the next round, because I don't
think there is any context in which it wasn't a war.

  I would conclude by saying, and I would ask for your reconsider-
ation of this, that although you should not answer questions about
cases which are likely to come before your Court, Marbury v. Madi-
son could, and, just as that is rockbed, I would hope that we would
have assurances from nominees that rockbed issues, like the juris-
diction of the Court to carry out Marbury v. Madison on constitu-
tional issues, like the first amendment and like the equal protec-
tion clause, are inviolate. Those are rockbed issues which are not
going to change, no matter who brings them to the Court, and we
are willing to stand up and say so.

  Judge GINSBURG. In a case of a judiciary nature, I am prepared
to do what a judge does.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Ginsburg, during my first round of
questions Wednesday, we had a discussion of antitrust. Now, anti-
trust is sort of a phrase in the law that you are very familiar with,
and a lot of Americans don't pay too much attention to it. But in
this Senator's opinion, it really has--it is the bedrock of the whole
free enterprise system.
  The question really having to do with antitrust is whether con-
glomerates of business or economic power can be used to adversely
affect the consumer in his or her right to buy or sell at a fair price.
  I would like to follow up on the discussion that we had yesterday.
As you may recall, I am concerned about the fact that the Supreme
Court appears to be of two minds about certain antitrust cases. Its
most recent decision on the subject seemed to favor a pro-big busi-
ness approach to antitrust law based on economic theory instead of
the facts. And that disturbs me much.
  My question to you is: How would you view an antitrust case
where the facts indicated that there had been anticompetitive con-
duct but the defendant attempted to justify it based on an economic
theory such as business efficiency?
  Judge GINSBURG. I am not going to be any more satisfying to
you, I am afraid, than I was to Senator Specter. I can answer anti-
trust questions as they emerge in a case. I said to you yesterday
that I believe the only case in which I addressed an antitrust ques-
tion fully on the merits was the Detroit newspaper case. In my
disserting opinion in that case, I attempted faithfully to interpret
the Newspaper Preservation Act. I sought to determine what Con-
gress meant in allowing that exemption from the antitrust laws.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Indeed you did.
  Judge GINSBURG. Antitrust, I will confess, is not my strong suit.
I have had, as you pointed out, some half a dozen--not many
                                      292
more--cases on this court. I think I understand the consumer pro-
tective purpose, the entrepreneur, independent decisionmaking pro-
tective thrust of those laws, but I can't give you an answer to your
abstract question any more than I could--I can't be any more satis-
fying on the question you are asking me than I was to Senator
Specter on the question that he was asking.

  If you talk about a particular case--my opinion in the Detroit
newspapers case was a dissent. There was a division in the court
on how to interpret the statute, the Newspaper Preservation Act.
That case indicates my approach to determining what Congress
meant.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, let me ask you this: Do you think
that anticompetitive conduct can ever be justified on the basis that
you have to have it in order to achieve business efficiency? I am
really not asking you how you would vote on a case. I am just sort
of asking you generally.

  Judge GlNSBURG. As you know, there is a key decision by Justice
Brandeis, Chicago Board of Trade, which teaches that restraints of
trade which are not per se illegal can be justified if their effects
are more procompetitive than anticompetitive. And that is the
analysis one would have to undertake.

  You asked me if the only purpose of the antitrust law is effi-
ciency. The cases indicate that the antitrust laws are focused on
the interests of the consumer. There is also an interest in preserv-
ing the independence of entrepreneurs. I don't think the antitrust
laws call into play only one particular economic theory. The Su-
preme Court made that clear in the Kodak (1992) case. But out of
the context of a specific case, I can't say much more. No, I don't
think efficiency is the sole drive.

  Senator METZENBAUM. In a totally different area, I recognize the
majority of Americans, and a majority in Congress for that matter,
support the death penalty as a means of dealing with violent crime.
I have long opposed the death penalty because of my concern that
our criminal justice system too often makes a mistake and sen-
tences an innocent person to death.

  I am frank to say that there are certain crimes with which I am
familiar, which we all read about in the paper, we see on nightly
TV, in which I would almost want to go out and shoot the criminal
myself with a gun because they are so heinous. But so often, too
often, mistakes are made.

  Four months ago, this committee held a hearing on innocence
and the death penalty, and we heard firsthand about two of the
tragic mistakes the criminal system made. We heard from Walter
McMillian, an African-American from Alabama, who was convicted
of murdering a convenience-store clerk after a trial lasting all of a
day-and-a-half. The jury recommended life imprisonment, but the
State judge, who was an elected official, perhaps recognized the po-
litical aspects of the matter, overruled the jury and ordered the
execution of McMillian. After 5 years on death row, Mr. McMillian
was freed because he did not commit the murder.

  We also heard from Randall Dale Adams, a white man who in
1979 came within a week--within a week--of being executed for
the murder of a Dallas, TX, policeman. Ten years later, he was able
to show his innocence and was released.
                                      293
  Another example occurred after our hearing. Just last month, a
white man from Maryland, Kirk Bloodsworth, was set free after 9
years in prison when it was conclusively proven that he did not
commit the heinous rape and murder of a young girl. He had been
sentenced to die.
  Our committee held a hearing to understand the problems with
the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Herrera v. Collins. In
that case, Mr. Herrera was sentenced to die and later obtained evi-
dence that allegedly proved his innocence. A Reagan-appointed
Federal judge, a district judge in Texas, wanted to conduct a timely
hearing to review Herrera's new evidence of innocence. He was pre-
pared to go forward with the hearing within 2 or 3 days. The State
of Texas objected to the district court's decision to hold a hearing,
and the case was sent to the Supreme Court for review.
  The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not require
that a hearing be granted to a death row inmate who has newly
discovered evidence which, if proven, could establish his innocence.
  In the opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist was unable
to declare clearly and unequivocally that the Constitution forbids
the execution of innocent people.
  The attorney who represented the State of Texas went even fur-
ther than the Chief Justice. She bluntly asserted that if a death
row inmate receives a fair trial, it does not violate the Constitution
to execute that inmate even if everyone agrees that he is innocent.
  Now, frankly, that is a shocking statement that came from the
prosecutor in that case. I am extremely concerned with the Court's
opinion in Herrera and the argument made by the Texas prosecu-
tor. Even though the Rehnquist opinion did not clearly hold that
it was unconstitutional to execute an innocent person, it is possible
to read that into his statements.
  Do you believe the Herrera case stands for the principle that it
is unconstitutional to execute an innocent person?
  Judge GlNSBURG. As I understand it--and the case is not fresh
in my mind--what the Court said was that the evidence in that
case was insufficient to show innocence. It did not exclude a dif-
ferent ruling in a case with a stronger record.
  We heard yesterday from Senator Feinstein who expressed her
anxiety about the number of cases that go on for years and years.
The colloquy occurring here shows the tremendous tensions and
difficulties in this area. Her concern was that there must be a time
when the curtain is drawn, and your anxiety is that no innocent
person should ever be put to death.
  Those tensions are before you, some of them are presented in the
Powell Commission report that you will address. My understanding
of Herrera(1993) is that it is concerned with the situation of a pris-
oner asserting, say 10 years after a conviction and multiple ap-
peals, "I didn't do it," and then the process would start all over
again.
  I can empathize tremendously with the concerns
  Senator METZENBAUM. NO, I don't think anybody would argue
that. I don't think anybody would argue that, Judge Ginsburg, that
10 years later he can "I didn't do it," because he has been saying
for 10 years he didn't do it.
                                      294

  Judge GINSBURG. What the Court said--this is to the best of n\,
recollection--is that the evidence was too slim in Herrera to make
out that claim, and it left the door open to a case where there was
stronger evidence of innocence. That case is yet to come before the
Court. So my understanding of this case is that, based on its par-
ticular record, the Court found the evidence too thin to show inno-
cence, but the Court left open the question whether one could
maintain such a plea on a stronger showing than the one made in
that case.

  That is as far as the Herrera case went. The decision left open
a case where a stronger showing could be made.

  Senator METZENBAUM. NOW, State courts, of course, should re-
view any new claim of a death row inmate that he is innocent. But
that review can be in an atmosphere of strong public pressure for
execution, especially when the conviction is for a particularly hei-
nous or vicious crime.

  Public pressure in these circumstances is most worrisome when
the State trial and appellate judges are elected. Historically, the
Federal courts have played a significant role in reviewing State
death penalty verdicts. Federal judges have lifetime appointments
and are more immune to the strong public sentiments that sur-
round death penalty cases for heinous and violent crimes.

  Now, the Herrera case raised significant new questions about the
availability of the Federal courts to hear the claim of a death row
inmate that he has new evidence of his innocence. Would you care
to explain your view on the general role Federal courts should play
in hearing the claims of death row inmates who have newly discov-
ered evidence of their innocence?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Metzenbaum, the question of habeas
review and its limits is before the Senate, before this committee,
I believe

  Senator METZENBAUM. But not before the Court. Not before the
Court, so I think it is entirely proper for you to respond.

  Judge GINSBURG. I can tell you of the legislation Congress passed
for the District in which I operate; that is, we generally do not
have habeas review. You have given to the District of Columbia
courts a fine postconviction remedy. It is identical to the Federal
remedy. The Supreme Court said, some time in the middle 1970's,
that one goes from the District of Columbia courts to the Supreme
Court. If the Supreme Court turns down a review request, there is
no collateral review in the Federal Courts.

  Some States must wonder why Congress so values the District of
Columbia courts and doesn't similarly value the State courts. But
I am now simply stating that in my court we don't have the brand
of habeas review that the regional circuits have because Congress
has said we don't. One of the reasons is that the President appoints
District of Columbia court judges. Although they are not life-
tenured judges, they are not elected or appointed by the city gov-
ernment. They are Presidential appointees commissioned to serve
as judges for the District of Columbia.

  What happens next in Federal habeas review, what controls
there should be in setting the difficult balance between fairness to
the defendant and finality in the system, is going to be your call,
                                      295
not the Court's call. The next step will be the legislative response
to the Powell Commission report.

  Senator METZENBAUM. But having said that it is our call, my
question to you is: What role do you believe the Federal courts
should play in hearing the claims of death row inmates who have
newly discovered evidence of their innocence, absent any action by
the Congress?

  Judge GlNSBURG. All one can say is that the evidence would have
to be stronger than it was in the Herrera case, because that is the
binding precedent at the moment. I can't give you an advisory opin-
ion on a case that is not before me with a particular record, a par-
ticular showing of innocence of the defendant in question.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not asking for an opinion in a case.
I am asking whether you feel that the Federal courts do have a role
to play in habeas proceedings where there is newly discovered evi-
dence that the guilty man, the man already found guilty, is inno-
cent?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I think the Supreme Court has indicated that
they do, but not without a sufficient showing, a factual showing, of
innocence.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I would agree you would have to have suf-
ficient evidence and factual showing of innocence, and I would ac-
cept that answer.

  The holding in a recent District of Columbia Circuit Court, U.S.
v. Thomas Jones, is very disturbing to me. The appeal to your court
involved the sentencing guidelines and whether a trial judge could
give a longer sentence to a defendant who admitted responsibility
for a crime after trial than could be given to the same defendant
if he had pled guilty and admitted responsibility for the crime be-
fore going to trial.

  On its face, it is shocking to consider that a trial court on its own
initiative could penalize an individual for exercising his constitu-
tional right to go to trial. The majority opinion, which you joined,
held that it was permissible for the trial judge to give a longer sen-
tence after the trial. Frankly, I have difficulty in comprehending
that.

  The four dissenting judges in the case stated that the majority
opinion improperly allowed for increased punishment of a defend-
ant for exercising his constitutional right to go to trial.

  Now, I realize that the Thomas Jones case involved complicated
sentencing guidelines. Therefore, I won't ask you to go into the spe-
cifics of the case. But what I do ask is whether you believe that
it is improper for a trial court on its own initiative to impose a
harsher sentence on a defendant just because that defendant chose
to exercise his or her constitutional right to go to trial rather than
to plead guilty.

  Judge GlNSBURG. That was not the nature of the trial judge's de-
cision in

  Senator METZENBAUM. NO, I am not asking about that case.
  Judge GlNSBURG. The answer to the question, can you penalize
someone for exercising a constitutional right, should be evident.
One cannot be punished for exercising a constitutional right. That
is not what happened in that case. The question was the degree of
clemency, the degree of leniency, the court was going to give.
                                      296
  The judge did something extraordinary in that case. He applied
the guidelines markedly in the defendant's favor. He gave the de-
fendant credit for acceptance of responsibility, which immediately
knocked the range down under the guidelines from a range of 151
months to 171 months, to one of 121 months to 151. He gave the
defendant 6 additional months--to make the sentence 127 months
instead of the very lowest that it could have been, 121 months--
because the defendant accepted responsibility late. The trial judge
thus took into account the point in the process at which the defend-
ant accepted responsibility. And that is all that case was about.
That was all the majority held. The court held that within the con-
text of giving a defendant credit for accepting responsibility for the
crime he committed, the district judge could take into account that
the man had accepted responsibility late--not on day one, but only
after a jury had found him guilty of the crime as charged.
  That is what that case involved. It is easy to mischaracterize
what the court ruled, but I believe my description is accurate.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not trying to go into that case. I am
asking the more broad general question of whether or not it is im-
proper for a trial court--forget about that case--to impose a harsh-
er sentence on a defendant who chooses to exercise his or her con-
stitutional right to a trial rather than plead guilty?
  Judge GiNSBURG. If you are asking the question, Can you penal-
ize someone, punish someone for exercising a constitutional right?
We have constitutional rights and one can't be punished for exer-
cising a constitutional right. Otherwise, the right is not real.
  Senator METZENBAUM. But you haven't answered.
  Judge GiNSBURG. You can't punish someone for exercising a con-
stitutional right. If you punish someone for exercising a constitu-
tional right, that person has no right.
  Senator METZENBAUM. OK. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. We will now, with your permission,
Judge, break for lunch until 2:15, if that is OK.
  [Whereupon, at 1:13 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:15 p.m., this same day.]

                                    AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will be in order.
  Judge, welcome back. We are starting a few minutes later, be-
cause there has been a very controversial vote on the floor of the
Senate, causing some Members to continue to engage in the debate,
and that is why some Members are not here. Thank you. I hope
you had a chance at least to get some lunch.
  I now yield to our distinguished colleague from the great State
of Iowa, which I do know well and have great love and respect for.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU notice how I only had to remind him
once about Iowa.
  Senator BROWN. I think he was referring to the State, not the
Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct. I do like the Senator from Iowa.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I was referring to the State, as well.
                                      297

  In your 1986 article, "Interpretations of Equal Protection
Clause," in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, you
wrote that the greatest figures of the Federal judiciary "have not
been born once or reborn later liberals or conservatives," and then
you went on to say:

  They have been independent thinking individuals with open, but not drafty
minds, individuals willing to listen, and throughout their day to learn. They have
been notably skeptical of all party lines. Above all, they have exhibited their readi-
ness to reexamine their own premises, liberal or conservative, as thoroughly as
those others.

  Now, this may sound like a softball question, but I would like to
ask you, from the standpoint of your years experience of judging--
and the reason I ask is just to see how you have evolved as a
judge--can you tell us whether any of your views have evolved or
changed over time? I don't want a lot of examples, maybe one ex-
ample would be enough. Is there something on which you have
changed a particular view of yours. How did it come about and
what was the view that changed, and why did it change.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Grassley, I am glad you quoted that,
because it is my creed. When I made my opening remarks, I quoted
from Judge Learned Hand's 'The Spirit of Liberty." He said "it is
the spirit that is not too sure that it is right." When I was asked
to enumerate the Justices I admire most, I left out some jurists one
might think should be on that list; I did so because they were
sometimes too sure they were right.

  An example that comes immediately to mind is in the field of
civil procedure. Civil procedure is a subject I taught for several
years. When I graduated from law school and was clerking for a
Federal district judge, I was absolutely sure of the answer to this
question: Does a Federal district court have authority to transfer
a case, although the transferee court lacked both subject matter
and personal jurisdiction?

  I had several conversations with the judge for whom I worked.
It was, in the end, his decision, but the decision he made coincided
with my own view--that the court was powerless to do anything
but dismiss the case. The second circuit affirmed the dismissal.
Then the Supreme Court reviewed the decision and held that the
lower courts got it wrong. We have one Federal court system. A
court without subject matter and personal jurisdiction could indeed
transfer the case to another Federal court that had authority to
hear it. That was the Supreme Court's decision.

  I have come to recognize over the years that my thinking was too
rigid, that the Supreme Court was indeed right in its view of the
flexibility of the Federal court system. So that is an example that
comes immediately to mind. I suppose it does, because procedure
is the subject I taught for 17 years.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you.
  I was supposed to inform Senator Biden whether or not I wanted
15 or 30 minutes, and I want to claim 30 minutes for my round.
  I want to go on to something that you discussed briefly with Sen-
ator Simpson, and that was the issue of recusals. There was some
confusion about the number of cases in which you were automati-
cally recused by the clerk of the court of appeals. Senator Simpson
thought it was 251, and Senator Biden's staff advised Senator
                                      298
Leahy it might have been 108. My count of the list in your ques-
tionnaire shows that it was a little more than 300 cases involving
more than 25 firms on the list. That is in addition to your 11 sua
sponte recusals.

  And while you recalled Tuesday that many of those recusals re-
sulted from your minor child's ownership of one share of El Paso
Natural Gas Co., I want to bring to your attention that none of the
cases listed in your questionnaire appeared to involve El Paso Nat-
ural Gas. If I am wrong on that, you can correct me.

  Rather, the cases that were listed on your questionnaire involved
the major American firms on your recusal list, which I understand
from your answers Tuesday are clients of members of your family
who practice law. I am sure that you will agree that it is important
that we clarify this matter, to make certain that conflicts of inter-
est will not substantially impair your ability to perform your duties
as an Associate Justice. I don't have any question that you will be
impartial in how you make a decision, but I want to ensure your
recusals don't impair the work of the Court.

  As you noted Tuesday, recusals are far more significant on the
Supreme Court, where every case is heard by nine Justices sitting
as a full panel, as opposed to the District of Columbia Circuit,
where any of the more than a dozen judges on the circuit court can
be selected by the clerk to make up the three-judge panel that de-
cides a case.

  In close cases before the Supreme Court, the recusal of one Jus-
tice can substantially undermine the ability of a court to lay down
a clear decisive ruling.

  If confirmed, will you continue to recuse yourself from cases in-
volving the firms listed in your questionnaire?

  Judge GINSBURG. No, Senator Grassley, and I will not for this
reason. The great bulk of those cases would not be on my recusal
list next year in any event, no matter what court I served on. Let
me explain.

  The latest count I got from my chambers, and they checked last
night, was 208 automatic recusals, 11 separately listed. You are
quite right in reporting that, indeed, it was not my son's two
shares of El Paso Natural Gas. In fact, in my early years on the
court, there were only four automatic recusals. The great bulk
came starting in 1984. A single corporate group my spouse rep-
resented from 1984 until this spring accounted for 111 of the 208
cases. That representation is now completed.

  That representation meant that I tied for second place in the
number of recusals listed for judges on my court. Eliminating that
group, I would be at or probably below the middle point. But I can
represent to you that the representation in question is indeed com-
pleted, so that the single corporate group that accounted for 111 of
the 208 recusals should no longer be on my recusal list.

  Senator LEAHY. If the Senator from Iowa will yield on my time,
yesterday there had been a question on this, or 2 days ago during
my discussion with Senator Simpson about recusals. I was acting
chairman at that time and I was given by the chairman's staff an
incorrect number which was the result of a typographical error.
Now I am told the actual number was 208, not 108, as I had rep-
resented from the staff printout, and approximately 100 of them
                                         299

were on matters relating to AT&T, a company which the Judge's
husband no longer represents, if I am getting the correct numbers
now.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, I was reluctant to mention the name of
the corporate group, but

  Senator LEAHY. I know, but we have had some question of this
and a number of Senators have raised questions of whether the ac-
curate numbers were given. That is why now the chairman has
asked me to note that the correct number is 208. I also understand
your husband no longer represents that client.

  Judge GlNSBURG. That representation is indeed completed.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I think your answer is satisfactory t<^me. But
I did have a concern, because, looking at those same firms and
their involvement in appeals to the Supreme Court over a period
of time, the LEXIS search found about 300 cases. Basically, what
you are saying now is that there isn't any involvement by any
member of your family with a large number of those firms, so there
wouldn't be a need for recusal. Is that your answer?
  Judge GlNSBURG. That's correct, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you very much.
  If I could go on to something that, to a nonlawyer like me, is a
little more complicated. It involves a decision that you were in-
volved in, United States v. Jackson. In that case, the defendant was
indicted under the Armed Career Criminal Act. You were called
upon to determine whether a part of the statute either enhanced
an existing criminal penalty for repeat offenders, or, instead, cre-
ated a new separate offense. You noted that the statute created a
new offense, and Jackson's conviction would have to be thrown out,
because the grand jury did not indict him for that new offense.
  You found the statutory language to be ambiguous, but you did
not apply the rule of lenity, where ambiguous criminal statutes are
supposed to be construed in favor of the defendant. Instead, you
upheld the conviction and, in so doing, it is my understanding, you
relied to a great extent on the statute's legislative history.

  To what extent should legislative history be used in interpreting
criminal statutes? While everyone is presumed to know the law,
how is a potential criminal to fairly foresee that a court will convict
him based on legislative history, rather than how he might read
the statute?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The meaning of a statute we would always like
to get, Senator Grassley, from the text of the statute itself. Some-
times that meaning is not clear and we must resort to construction
aids. Aid sometimes comes from legislative history, sometimes from
an agency interpretation. I do not have the case that you men-
tioned in the front of my mind, and I would have to look at it to
refresh my recollection. But I am certainly conscious of the need for
fair notice to anyone in the criminal justice system.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Why don't we do this, since it is not familiar
to your mind, we will get you a copy of it and then you can answer
at a later time in another round for me. Would that be OK?

  Judge GlNSBURG. That is fine.
   Senator GRASSLEY. I would rather have you answer as thor-
oughly as you can.
                                               300

  I was here when Senator Biden talked about unenumerated
rights. I was not here yesterday when the issue again came up, but
I am glad that the chairman clarified whether the Constitution pro-
tects the right to marry. It doesn't protect the right to marry
whomever a person chooses to marry. The Supreme Court has said
the Constitution protects against State interference with the right
to marry, if that State regulation is based on race. But the State
can and does regulate the right to marry. For example, bigamy
laws exist, and protection against people marrying their siblings
exist. So you agree with Senator Biden's clarification, don't you,
that the Constitution doesn't protect a right to marry whomever a
person wants?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, I agree with that. That has been recog-
nized even in the face of a free exercise of religion challenge, as the
bigamy case you mentioned demonstrates.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Similarly, you know that there is no
unenumerated constitutional right to get a job, assuming no race
or gender discrimination. The Supreme Court has never held that
anyone has a right to a job, and it is a fundamental part of con-
stitutional law that protections against race and gender discrimina-
tion apply only to government actors, not to private employers. If
the Constitution itself banned job discrimination, then there never
would have been a need to enact the civil rights statues, which are
based on the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce,
and not upon section 5 of the 14th amendment.

  So you agree that the Constitution does not protect the right to
a job, free of race or gender discrimination?

  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Senator Grassley, the Constitution is es-
tablished by and for the people through the people's representa-
tives. The individual rights recognized in the Constitution are
phrased as restraints on Government. The Constitution says what
Government may or may not do.

  There is a conspicuous exception, an instance in which the Con-
stitution directly applies to persons. That instance is the 13th
amendment, which says that slavery shall not exist, slavery or in-
voluntary servitude shall not exist in the United States. That pro-
vision governs everyone in these United States.

  Senator GRASSLEY. But you are in no way saying that that con-
fers a right to a job?

  Judge GINSBURG. In our country, as opposed to some newer de-
mocracies, we guarantee directly against Government intrusion
into fundamental civil and political rights. Economic and social
rights are in the charge of the legislature. Our Constitution does
not guarantee a right to work, a right to be fed, a right to be
clothed, a right to have decent shelter. Our society is as respectful
of those rights as any I know, but the respect comes through meas-
ures passed by the legislature, and not in the form of a constitu-
tional command that courts are capable of implementing.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Ginsburg, you have declined to talk
about the constitutionality of capital punishment. You have distin-
guished your discussions about abortion from your unwillingness to
talk about the death penalty on the basis that you haven't written
about or spoken about capital punishment. I hope I understand
that that was your answer before. So I want to bring to your atten-
                                      301
tion that during your tenure at the ACLU, you wrote an amicus
brief in Coker v. Georgia,arguing that the death penalty for rape
was not constitutional.

  You have written, then, haven't you, on the death penalty?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I did not write on the general question of the
constitutionality of the death penalty. The Coker v. Georgia(1977)
brief said the death penalty for rape--where there was no death or
serious permanent injury, apart from the obvious psychological in-
jury--was disproportionate for this reason: The death penalty for
rape historically was a facet of the view that woman belonged to
man. First, she was her father's possession. If she suffered rape be-
fore marriage, she became damaged goods. The rapist was a thief.
He stole something that belonged first to the father, then, when
the woman married, to her husband. Once raped, a woman would
be regarded as damaged goods.
  We have seen that phenomenon recently in tragic incidents in
many places in the world. Women in Bangladesh, for example,
were discarded, were treated as worthless because they had been
raped. That was what prompted my position in Coker v.Georgia.
That is the whole thrust of the brief I co-authored. We emphasized
that rape was made punishable by death because man's property
had been taken from him by reason of the rape of his woman. That
was the perspective that informed the Cokerv. Georgia brief.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Again, I am not a lawyer, so when I refer to
something, if you want to tell me that I am missing a point, feel
free to do it. But on page 22 of that brief, a heading, underlined,
says the death sentence for rape is impermissible under the 8th
amendment because it does not meet "contemporary standards re-
garding the infliction of punishment and is inadvisable since it di-
minishes legal protection afforded rape victims."
  It seems to me it deals directly with the issue of the eighth
amendment.
  Judge GlNSBURG. "Diminishes legal protections afforded rape vic-
tims." Senator Grassley, I urge you to read the entire Coker v.
Georgia brief. I think you will find it to be exactly what I rep-
resented it to be.
  One of the reasons why rapes went unpunished, why women who
had been raped suffered the indignity of having the police refuse
to prosecute, was statutes of that order.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Please understand that the reason I brought
it up wasn't that I want you to tell me any more than you were
willing to tell other people on your position on the death penalty.
I brought it up because you said you hadn't written on the subject,
and I found something that you have written on the subject.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I have written on the subject of women who
have been raped and society's attitude toward them. Coker v. Geor-
gia fits into that category. My statements regarding that case
should not be taken out of context to say or imply anything about
any subject other than the one addressed in that brief. The position
developed in the brief was that the death penalty for rape, the ori-
gin of that penalty and the perpetuation of it, was harmful to
women. Far from resulting in conviction
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, let me ask you this, then, separate from
the issue of the extent of your writings: Did Coker,outside the fact
                                                  302

that it outlawed capital punishment in the case of rape, solve the
purpose that your brief intended to solve?

  Judge GlNSBURG. It was a contribution to the proper way to look
at this terrible crime. It was a contribution to the end of thinking
of women as damaged goods because they had been raped. That is
what I think about it.

  Senator GRASSLEY. If I could go on to another point, yesterday
in conversation with Senator Cohen, there was a discussion of
whether judges should or should not follow opinion polls. In light
of that statement, I wonder what you think of the approach to con-
stitutional decisionmaking espoused by the authors of the joint
opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. And I don't want this to
be a discussion about abortion. That is not my point.

  I want to quote:

  Where in the performance of its judicial duties the Court decides a case in such
a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe, its
decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It
is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution
calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division
by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.

  Do you agree that Justices should consider the political dimen-
sions of controversial cases, or is that the kind of constitutionally
unprincipled "pleasing the home crowd" that you have criticized?

  Judge GlNSBURG. What those three Justices said in the Casey
(1992) case I think has to be taken in the context of what they said
before. They were talking about the importance of stare decisis, of
precedent, in a judicial system. What I regard as most important,
Senator Grassley, is what those Justices said just before the line
you read. They talked about stability in the legal system. Was a
precedent plainly established? How was it working in society? Had
reliance interests been built up around it?

  There is an expansive discussion of the principle of stare decisis
in that portion of the Casey opinion. The sentences you read can't
be detached from the three or four pages that go before it. The part
that goes before stresses the reliance interest built up around a
precedent, the generation of women who have grown up thinking
that Roe v. Wade (1973) is the law of the land.

  That is the central part of the stare decisis discussion, and not
the very last part, the portion you read. To concentrate on that last
part, I think, diminishes what is a very satisfactory, very complete
discussion of the principle of stare decisis. Those last sentences
seem to me not nearly as impressive as what went before. The dis-
cussion of stare decisis in the central part of the opinion is excel-
lent and means much more than that last paragraph. Taken in iso-
lation, the last paragraph might be misperceived. I think it must
be read in context. I might express, regarding judicial opinions, the
same things I say about legislation. The first rule is read, the next
rule is read on, and the third rule is read back.

  That is my view of the portion of the Casey opinion about which
you inquired. I can't give that paragraph a mark apart from what
precedes it. Taking it together with what precedes it, the whole is
a very impressive statement of the doctrine of stare decisis.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, without commenting on Casey or Roe or
any other case, could you just simply comment whether judges
                                               303

should, in any way, consider the effects of their rulings on external
political disputes?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I have said here and in several other places
that a judge

  Senator GRASSLEY. Should they be drafting political com-
promises?

  Judge GlNSBURG. A judge is not a politician. A judge rules in ac-
cord with what the judge determines to be right. That means in the
context of the particular case, based on the arguments the parties
present, in accord with the applicable law and precedent. A judge
must do that no matter what the home crowd wants, no matter
how unpopular that decision is likely to be. If it is legally right, it
is the decision that the judge should render.

  And I also said what a judge should take account of is not the
weather of the day, but the climate of an era. The climate of the
age, yes, but not the weather of the day, not what the newspaper
is reporting.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU addressed the standing issue to some ex-
tent yesterday with Senator Heflin, and you have talked with a
number of Senators about deferring to Congress as you decide
cases. I would like to talk about one case, that was a dissent of
yours, that covers both issues.

  In Dellums v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,you called for def-
erence to congressional predictions regarding the South African
sanction laws. The plaintiffs were trying to sue the NRC over the
importation of a commodity that wasn't specifically mentioned in
those sanction laws. They argued its importation violated the law
and, therefore, prevented a quicker end to the apartheid govern-
ment.

  The majority found that they lacked standing. You dissented. By
deferring to congressional predictions, weren't you actually expand-
ing the scope of constitutional standing and Federal court jurisdic-
tion? And isn't there a line to be drawn between what you might
have to look for that we just talked about, legislative history, con-
gressional intent, and what are congressional predictions?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Grassley, let me try to explain the Del-
lums (1988) case. The constitutional requirement for standing was
that a person show injury in fact. Among the plaintiffs in that
case--the one on whom I concentrated--was an exile, an outcast
from his country, a South African black who had been banned from
his native country because of his political activity.

  Our Congress, you, had enacted an embargo on certain commod-
ities from South Africa. In doing so, you said you thought that put-
ting this kind of pressure on the South African Government would
hasten the time when apartheid would end. When apartheid
ended--or when it began to break down--that man could return to
his native country.

  He said he was injured by his outcast status. You said you were
pursuing a policy designed to promote the end of apartheid, the day
that this man would no longer be an outcast from his country.

  I was following the constitutional requirement that to have
standing to sue one must suffer an injury in fact. This man was
claiming an injury, and I was relying on your factfinding that the
                                               304

measure you took could hasten the day when his injury would end.
That is the nub of my dissenting position.

  The court majority disagreed with me and said he didn't sustain
an injury in fact. I thought he did, and I relied on your factfinding
that the reason you put an embargo on South Africa was not to do
something futile, but to hasten the day when apartheid in that
country would end. On that day, this man would no longer be an
exile from his native land. That was my reasoning in the Dellums
case.

  You asked me before if I stand ready to reexamine my own deci-
sions. If you asked me in this Chamber today: Do I think I was
right in taking the position that the plaintiff in Dellums suffered
an injury in fact within the meaning of article III of the Constitu-
tion, and that Congress had recognized his injury would abate as
a result of the embargo? I thought my decision was right then, and
I think it is right today, and I stand by my dissent in the Dellums
case.

  Senator GRASSLEY. AS a taxpayer, I would like to have standing
in court based on a prediction Congress makes. In fact, we are in
the process of making a prediction right now that 4 or 5 years from
now we will have $500 billion less deficit than we have now. And
if we don't meet that target, can a taxpayer sue me--not sue

  Judge GlNSBURG. A taxpayer has standing
  Senator GRASSLEY. Would it have standing in court?
  Judge GlNSBURG. No. The answer is "no." Under current prece-
dent, a taxpayer has standing to challenge only one thing, and that
is the State's involvement in establishing a church. A taxpayer--
you are a taxpayer, and I am a taxpayer, and we have snared
grievances about what the Government does with our money. But
the plaintiff who had been declared an exile, an outcast from his
native land, was not a taxpayer who shared with the generality of
the public a common grievance. He was not complaining about the
way the Government was spending his tax dollars. The cases are
simply not comparable. There is only one category of case in which
a taxpayer can sue. The paradigm case, under current precedent,
is Flast v. Cohen(1968).
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I was hoping that I would maybe have
a friend on the Court who would want to overturn Frothingham.
  My last question: In response to questions by Senator Pressler
and Senator Moseley-Braun yesterday, you stated basic agreement
with the Court's general holding in Lucas v. South Carolina Coast-
al Council that a regulatory taking which denies an owner of all
economically beneficial uses of her property violated the fifth
amendment.
  Now I, of course, understand your unwillingness to elaborate on
Lucas because there will be many, many more cases before the
courts. But I would like to see if you could help me understand the
rule of Lucas.
  The Court said that when a regulation leaves an owner with no
economic use of her property, the land has been taken for the bene-
fit of the general public just as if the Government has physically
occupied the land. Do you think that what I just said was an accu-
rate statement of the holding in Lucas?

  Judge GINSBURG. The Court said, just as you summarized it, that
the Government cannot take, but it may regulate. There is a point
at which the regulation is so enveloping that it becomes a taking.
When the Government acts so as to deprive the owner of all of the
value of the land, as the Supreme Court said in Lucas (1992), that
is tantamount to a taking and it must be compensated.

  The Lucas case itself went back to the lower court to determine
whether that was, indeed, the case--had the owner been deprived
of all the economic value of the land. But you are also right, Sen-
ator Grassley, that the point at which regulation becomes a taking
is something that will be determined case by case. Many cases will
come before the Court calling for development of the doctrine of the
Lucas case.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Judge Ginsburg.
  Senator LEAHY [presiding]. Thank you, Judge. You can see how
these hearings have progressed. Once again, the back-benchers
come in to chair the hearing. I would hope that you feel com-
plimented by that lack of a full-court attention up here. I suspect
it indicates more approval than disapproval.
  Earlier this morning, I know that you and Senator Hatch had a
dialog regarding Judge Thomas, now Justice Thomas' confirmation
hearing. I had asked him some questions about Roe v. Wade. Both
the questions and answers became a matter of some of the debate
subsequently in Justice Thomas' confirmation hearings.
  Without going further, I just want to make sure that when some-
body dusts off these records they get it fully and accurately, and
so I will place in the record at this point the transcript of the series
of questions I asked then-Judge Thomas regarding Roe v. Wade
and his responses to them. That is not directed as a question to
you. I know you went through that this morning.

kind of an effort to make difficult decisions- in any area, a judge
tries to examine the relevant evidence and tries to reach a rea-
soned conclusion and tries to reach a conclusion, without implicat-
ing or without involving his or her personal opinions.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, you were in law school at the time Roe v.
Wade was decided. That was 17 or 18 years ago. You would accept,
would you not, that in the last generation. Roe v. Wade is certainly
one of the more important cases to be decided by the U.S. Supreme
Court?

  Judge THOMAS. I would accept that it has certainly been one of
the more important, as well as one that has been one of the more
highly publicized and debated cases.

  Senator LEAHY. SO, it would be safe to assume that when that
decision came down--you were in law school, where recent case
law is oft discussed--that Roe v. Wade would have been discussed
in the law school while you were there?

  Judge THOMAS. The case that I remember being discussed most
during my early part of law school was I believe in my small group
with Thomas Emerson may have been Griswold, since he argued
that, and we may have touched on Roe v. Wade at some point and
debated that, but let me add one point to that.

  Because I was a married student and I worked, I did not spend a
lot of time around the law school doing what the other students en-
joyed so much, and that is debating all the current cases and all of
the slip opinions. My schedule was such that I went to classes and
generally went to work and went home.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge Thomas, I was a married law student who
also worked, but I also found, at least between classes, that we did
discuss some of the law, and I am sure you are not suggesting that
there wasn't any discussion at any time of Roe v. Wade?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I cannot remember personally engaging
in those discussions.

  Senator LEAHY. OK.
  Judge THOMAS. The groups that I met with at that time during
my years in law school were small study groups.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you ever had discussion of Roe v. Wade,
other than in this room, in the 17 or 18 years it has been there?
  Judge THOMAS. Only, I guess, Senator, in the fact in the most
general sense that other individuals express concerns one way or
the other, and you listen and you try to be thoughtful. If you are
asking me whether or not I have ever debated the contents of it,
that answer to that is no, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you ever, in private gatherings or other-
wise, stated whether you felt that it was properly decided or not?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, in trying to recall and reflect on that, I
don't recollect commenting one way or the other. There were,
again, debates about it in various places, but I generally did not
participate. I don't remember or recall participating, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. SO you don't ever recall stating whether you
thought it was properly decided or not?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't recall saying one way or the other, Sena-
tor.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, was it properly decided or not?

                                                223

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that that is where I just have to
say what I have said before; that to comment on the holding in
that case would compromise my ability to

  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this: Have you made any deci-
sion in your own mind whether you feel Roe v. Wade was properly
decided or not, without stating what that decision is?

  Judge THOMAS. I have not made, Senator, a decision one way or
the other with respect to that important decision.

  Senator LEAHY. When you came up for confirmation last time for
the circuit court of appeals, did you consider your feelings on Roe
v. Wade, in case you would be asked?

  Judge THOMAS. I had not--would I have considered, Senator, or
did I consider?

  Senator LEAHY. Did you consider.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. SO you cannot recollect ever taking a position on
whether it was properly decided or not properly decided, and you
do not have one here that you would share with us today?
  Judge THOMAS. I do not have a position to share with you here
today on whether or not that case was properly decided. And, Sena-
tor, I think that it is appropriate to just simply state that it is--for
a judge, that it is late in the day as a judge to begin to decide
whether cases are rightly or wrongly decided when one is on the
bench. I truly believe that doing that undermines your ability to
rule on those cases.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, with all due respect, Judge, I have some
difficulty with your answer that somehow this case has been so far
removed from your discussions or feelings during the years since it
was decided while you were in law school. You have participated in
a working group that criticized Roe. You cited Roe in a footnote to
your article on the privileges or immunity clause. You have re-
ferred to Lewis Lehrman's article on the meaning of the right to
life. You specifically referred to abortion in a column in the Chica-
go Defender. I cannot believe that all of this was done in a vacuum
absent some very clear considerations of Roe v. Wade, and, in fact,
twice specifically citing Roe v. Wade.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, your question to me was did I debate the
contents of Roe y. Wade, the outcome in Roe v. Wade, do I have
this day an opinion, a personal opinion on the outcome in Roe v.
Wade;and my answer to you is that I do not.
  Senator LEAHY. Notwithstanding the citing of it in the article on
privileges or immunities, notwithstanding the working group that
criticized Roe?
  Judge THOMAS. I would like to have the cite to it. Again, notwith-
standing the citation, if there is one, I did not and do not have a
position on the outcome.
  With respect to the working group, Senator, as I have indicated,
the working group did not include the drafting by that working
group of the final report. My involvement in that working group
was to submit a memorandum, a memorandum that I felt was an
important one, on the issue of low-income families. And I thought
that that was an important contribution and one that should have
been a central part in the report. But with respect to the other
comments, I did not participate in those comments.

                                       224

  Senator LEAHY. I will make sure that you have an opportunity to
read both the footnote citation and the Lewis Lehrman article
before we get another go-round. But am I also correct in character-
izing your testimony here today as feeling that as a sitting judge it
would be improper even to express an opinion on Roe v. Wade, if
you do have one?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator. I think the important
thing for me as a judge, Senator, has been to maintain my impar-
tiality. When one is in the executive branch--and I have been in
the executive branch, and I have tried to engage in debate and
tried to advance the ball in discussions, tried to be a good advocate
for my points of views and listening to other points of views. But
when you move to the judiciary, I don't think that you can afford
to continue to accumulate opinions in areas that are strongly con-
troverted because those issues will eventually be before the Court
in some form or another.

  Senator LEAHY. Of course, as Senator Metzenbaum pointed out
earlier today, you have spoken about a number of cases, and I un-
derstand your differentiation in your answers to his question on
that. But I wonder if those cases somehow fit a different category.
The expression once was that the Supreme Court reads the newspa-
pers, and I suppose we can update that today to say that Supreme
Court nominees read the newspapers and know that this issue is
going to be brought up.

  But, Judge, other sitting Justices have expressed views on key
issues such as--well, take Roe v. Wade. You know, Justice Scalia
has expressed opposition to Roe. Does that disqualify him if it
comes up? Justice Blackmun not only wrote the decision but has
spoken in various forums about why it was a good decision. Is
either one of them disqualified from hearing abortion cases as a
result?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that each one of them has to de-
termine in his mind at what point do they compromise their impar-
tiality or it is perceived that they have compromised their objectivi-
ty or their ability to sit fairly on those cases. And I think for me,
shortly after I went on the court of appeals, I remember chatting
with a friend just about current events and issues. And I can re-
member her saying to me, asking me three or four times what my
opinion was on a number of issues, and my declining to answer
questions that when I was in the executive branch I would have
freely answered. And her point was that I was worthless as a con-
versationalist now because I had no views on these issues. And I
told her that I had changed roles and the role that I had was one
that did not permit me or did not comport with accumulating
points of views.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, I might just state parenthetically, I have
been both a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and I have been
before judges who have expressed very strong views on the idea
that when they go on the bench, they do not go into a monastery--
they still are part of the populace, able to express views. And I
have been there when they have expressed views both for and
against a position of a client I might be representing, whether it is
the State on the one hand or the defendant on another. But I have
also felt secure in knowing that they were fairminded people and
                                       310

                                      225

would set their own personal opinions aside, as judges are supposed
to and as you have testified one should do in such a case.

  Let me ask you this: Would you keep an open mind on cases
which concern the question of whether the ninth amendment pro-
tected a given right? I would assume you would answer yes.

  Judge THOMAS. The ninth amendment, I think the only concern I
have expressed with respect to the ninth amendment, Senator, has
been a generic one and one that I think that we all would have
with the more openended provisions in the Constitution, and that
is that a judge who is adjudicating under those openended provi-
sions tether his or her ruling to something other than his or her
personal point of view.

  Now, the ninth amendment has, to my knowledge, not been used
to decide a particular case by a majority of the Supreme Court, and
there hasn't been as much written on that as some of the other
amendments. That does not mean, however, that there

  Senator LEAHY. That is not what I am
  Judge THOMAS. That does not mean, however, that there couldn't
be a case that argues or uses the ninth amendment as a basis for
an asserted right that could come before the Court that does not--
that the Court or myself, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed,
would not be open to hearing and open to deciding.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU are saying that you would have an open
mind on ninth amendment cases?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. I ask that because you have expressed some very
strong views, as you know better than all of us, on the ninth
amendment. You had an article that was reprinted in a Cato Insti-
tute book on the Reagan years. You refer to Justice Goldberg's "in-
vention," of the ninth amendment in his concurring opinion in
Griswold. And you said--and let me quote from you. You said,
"Far from being a protection, the ninth amendment will likely
become an additional weapon for the enemies of freedom." A pretty
strong statement. But you would say, would you not, Judge, not-
withstanding that strong statement, that if a ninth amendment
case came before you, you would have an open mind?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, as I noted, my concern was that I
didn't believe that--in such an openended provision as the ninth
amendment, it was my view that a judge would have to tether his
or her view or his or her interpretation to something other than
just their feeling that this right is OK or that right is OK. I believe
the approach that Justice Harlan took in Poe v. Ullman and again
reaffirmed in Griswold in determining the--or assessing the right
of privacy was an appropriate way to go.
  Senator LEAHY. That is not really my point. The point I am
making is that you expressed very strong views--and you have
here, too--about the ninth amendment. My question is: Notwith-
standing those very strong views you have expressed about the
ninth amendment--pretty adverse views about it--would you have
an open mind in a case before you where somebody is relying on
the ninth amendment?
  Judge THOMAS. The answer to that is, Senator, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. But if you were to express similar views regard-
ing the principles and reasoning of Roe v. Wade, you feel that
                                       311

                                       226

somehow it would preclude you from having that same kind of ob-
jectivity as the views you have expressed about the ninth amend-
ment?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't believe, Senator, that I have expressed
any view on the ninth amendment, beyond what I have said in this
hearing, after becoming a member of the judiciary. As I pointed
out, I think it is important that when one becomes a member of
the judiciary that one ceases to accumulate strong viewpoints, and
rather begin to, as I noted earlier, to strip down as a runner and to
maintain and secure that level of impartiality and objectivity nec-
essary for judging cases.

  Senator LEAHY. Does that mean if you were just a nominee, a
private citizen as a nominee to the Supreme Court, you could
answer the question, but as a judge you cannot?

  Judge THOMAS. I think a judge is even more constrained than a
nominee, but I also believe that in this process, that if one does not
have a formulated view, I don't see that it improves or enhances
impartiality to formulate a view, particularly in some of these diffi-
cult areas.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up, but I
am sure the judge realizes that we will probably havi to revisit
this subject a tad more. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Chair recognizes Senator Kennedy for a moment regarding a
clarification of a quote that was used this morning.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there was
just one area of clarification.
  Yesterday I questioned Judge Thomas, and I used these words:

  Mr. Sowell goes on to suggest that employers are justified in believing that mar-
ried women are less valuable as employees than married men. He says that if a
woman is not willing to work overtime as often as some other workers, needs more
time off for personal emergencies, that may make her less valuable as an employee
or less promotable to jobs with heavier responsibilities.

  And then the judge went on and gave his response to that ques-
tion.

  In a response to a question earlier this morning from Senator
DeConcini, Judge Thomas said, "There were questions on--I think
the comment yesterday by Senator Kennedy, I believe, was some-
thing to the effect that women who were married weren't as good
employees. And as an employer and someone who has employed a
significant number of women, I did not find that to be true and
made that very clear."

  I would just like to ask consent that the record--I understood
what Judge Thomas was trying to say this morning, and

  Judge THOMAS. I did not intend to attribute Professor Sowell's
quotes to you. [Laughter.]

  Senator KENNEDY. SO I would just ask consent that the record re-
flect that modification at the appropriate point.

  Senator LEAHY. I thought that was a little out of character there,
Ted.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the record will be corrected.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Spec-
ter.

  Senator LEAHY. Yesterday you and I went through a number of
very specific questions and you gave what I thought were, in the
appropriate instances, some very specific responses, and in others
you felt that you could not respond based on issues that may come
before the Court. This morning around 1 or 2 o'clock, I was watch-
ing a replay on television of your responses to my questions and
your responses to a number of other Senators' questions, and mak-
ing notes about it.
  I was thinking about what I might do today, and I would prob-
ably be a little bit less specific, but use the advise and consent
process for what I have often felt it should be: a way of looking into
your jurisprudential soul, or actually a way for the country to do
so.
  I realize that, as is appropriate, people pay not so much attention
to who might be asking the questions, but, rather, to what you say,
and it really is a way for the American people to know just how
you think.
  So let me ask you this: Judge, you have spoken eloquently of the
reaction you had when you first got the call from the President,
when he asked you if you would accept this nomination. You spoke
eloquently in the Rose Garden. You have been a judge for a num-
ber of years in a prestigious court. You have certainly been a stu-
dent of the Supreme Court from the time you were in law school,
and you practiced before it, had to rely on cases from it in deciding
how you might vote on individual cases.
  Now you have had to think, I would assume, a great deal from
the day the President asked you to accept this nomination, right
up to this moment, just what you might or might not do as a Su-
preme Court Justice. In that, you have 200 years of history of the
Court. Could you give me some of the cases you consider the most
important Supreme Court cases, taken from whatever era, time, re-
cent or not, just some of those that mean the most to you and why?
  Judge GlNSBURG. To start from the beginning, Marbury v. Madi-
son (1803) established judicial review for constitutionality of other
great decisions of the Marshall Court era, I might mention, as sig-
nal, Gibbons v. Ogden (1824). When I recited from the Pledge of Al-
legiance before, I said "one nation, indivisible." I would put Gib-
bons v. Ogden in the one nation camp.
  Proceeding to our times, I would list the great dissents of Holmes
and Brandeis in Abrams (1919) and Gitlow (1925), and Brandeis'
concurring opinion in Whitney v. California (1927). People think
free speech was always secure in this country. It really wasn't.
That is a development of our current century, reflected in those
great dissenting opinions that are now well accepted. But they
were originally stated as dissenting positions. Brown v. Board of
Education (1954) must be on any list.
  That gives you about half a dozen.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, let me go to the dissents for a moment,
because you and I talked about first amendment rights and free-
dom of speech before. How have you seen the evolution of our free
speech rights in this country? Obviously, it is stated in the Bill of
Rights from the beginning. But as you said, it has changed,
evolved. We saw censorship during the Civil War and President
Lincoln's time, everything from the suspension of habeas corpus
                                      313

and suspension of freedom of speech. We have seen attacks on it
that have been either direct government attacks or responses in
fear. The McCarthy era comes to mind, when there were truly at-
tacks on the first amendment.

  Do you see that right as still evolving in this country?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Free expression was an ideal from the start.
The Alien and Sedition Act, early on, severely limited free speech.
That law was never declared unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court, but it has been overturned by the history of our country
since that time.
  The idea was there from the beginning, though. I mentioned the
Revolutionary War cartoon, "LIBERTY of speech for those who
speak the speech of liberty." The idea was always there. The oppo-
sition to the government as censor was always there.
  But it is only in our time that that right has come to be recog-
nized as fully as it is today. The line of cases ending in Branden-
burg v. Ohio (1969) truly recognizes that free speech means not
freedom of thought and speech for those with whom we agree, but
freedom of expression for the expression we hate.
  New contexts undoubtedly will arise. But everyone accepts that
the dissenting positions of Holmes and Brandeis have become the
law. That is where we stand today.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you consider Brandenburg as one of the great
milestones in the Court's history?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I certainly do, yes. I think Brandenburg was a
1969 decision. The McCarthy era was well over by then. There
were many brave judges in the period of McCarthy, including
Learned Hand, who wrote one of the great early decisions in the
Masses (1917) case. There were some outstanding decisions of Jus-
tice Harlan in that very difficult time for our country. But I think
Brandenburg is not the least controversial now.
  Senator LEAHY. I remember very well when it came down. I was
a young prosecutor at the time in Vermont, and I remember some
of the discussion there. We have gone through an interesting time
during the McCarthy era, when at the University of Vermont, the
oldest land grant university, there was a question of whether a pro-
fessor was loyal enough. Our State's largest newspaper questioned
his loyalty, actually trying to get him suspended. The same news-
paper now, to its credit, stands up very strongly for free speech.
But it shows just how the evolution could be.
   In fact, it was a Senator from Vermont, Ralph Flanders, who was
probably the greatest Vermont Senator of the century, who stood
up and introduced a resolution condemning Senator McCarthy on
the floor of the Senate, and finally started to bring to an end what
was a very sad and I think sorry time in our history.
   I wonder where democracy might be, had we not seen this right
continuously expand. It is a momentary contraction, but I believe
you would agree with me on this, during our 200-year history, it
has continuously expanded, in the aggregate, it hasn't contracted.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think we have been a model for the world in
that regard. Recall the words from Ballard for America, 'The right
to speak my mind out, that's America to me." It is one of the great
things about our country.
                                      314
  I was a student at Cornell during the McCarthy era. In those
days, most students just wanted to make their own way in the
world, and were not politically active.
  I had a wonderful professor, his name was Robert Cushman, he
was one of the teachers who was most important to me. He was
in the government department, and I worked for him. He had me
read Alan Barth. I scanned issues of "Red Channels" as he sug-
gested. That way, I came to know about what was going on, about
the people banned from the entertainment business, because they
were considered, if not red, then pink-tinged. That was an indelible
part of my upbringing. A great teacher forced me to think about
the times in which we were living, when I really didn't want to.
  Senator LEAHY. My parents ran a small weekly newspaper back
in Vermont and they ran a printing business, and I recall, growing
up, being encouraged to read whatever I wanted. Read whatever
you want, but just read. It is not bad advice for any parent to give
to their child, especially today.
  But I am struck by the fact that, as various countries have
moved toward democracy, from their new parliaments, they send
people to our country to visit with Members of the Congress or
State legislatures, and invariably with every single group that has
come to my office, we have ended up in a discussion of how we
have allowed free speech, an expanse of speech and difference of
opinions, and how struck they have been by that, because so many
of them have come from countries where there is anything but.
There is a controlled press, there is controlled, allowable speech.
  What I have always told them is I felt that in our first amend-
ment we really have the whole groundwork for democracy. We have
a freedom of religion or not to practice a religion, whichever you
want, and freedom of speech, which guarantees diversity and diver-
sity guarantees democracy.
  I find now that we have the question of does it expand further
in new technologies. I am chairman of the Technology Subcommit-
tee here, and one scholar suggested a new amendment to the Con-
stitution explicitly to extend constitutional freedoms including free-
dom of speech and also search and seizure protections to new tech-
nologies, computer technologies, I guess E mail and all the rest. Do
you think we need a change in the Constitution, or do you think
we can work it within the Constitution we have, as we deal with
computer and other electronic technologies?
  Judge GINSBURG. I think that our over 200-year-old Constitution
has been able to deal with more difficult things than new computer
technology. But I would like to consult my daughter on that ques-
tion, because she is the copyright expert in our family.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, we all accept easily that political speech
is protected. Again, just to expand a little bit on what we discussed
yesterday about scientific speech, does it get the same kind of pro-
tection?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I am not sure I understand what you
mean by scientific speech.
  Senator LEAHY. If somebody is writing in an area of science, for
example, do they have the same protection as if they were speaking
just on political issues?
  Judge GINSBURG. I can't imagine why not.
C  315

  Senator LEAHY. What about in the area of entertainment?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Now we are getting into more slippery terri-
tory. It depends on what kind of entertainment, I suppose. The Su-
preme Court has a series of decisions about speech that is in the
netherland between fully protected speech and unprotected speech,
speech within the first amendment, but not entitled to the same
level of protection as other speech.
  The Supreme Court has made decisions about adult movie thea-
ters that can be zoned for the safety of the neighborhood. A munici-
pality can decide to spread them out so they won't be clustered, or
can put them all together in one combat zone. There is a difference
between the degree of tolerance for such expression and the greater
respect accorded political speech.
  Then, as you know, there is a category of speech that is unpro-
tected by the first amendment, a category called obscenity. There
is also a category of speech that is not out of the ballpark, but is
subject to regulation, called indecent speech. That is an area that
I can't talk about in specific terms, because it is one that has come
before my court, and is coming before the Supreme Court in con-
nection with broadcast regulation. But I recognize that there is
that category of speech that does not get the full protection of the
first amendment, but is not left out entirely.
  Senator LEAHY. Political speech, that truly you feel has absolute
protection?
  Judge GlNSBURG. It has the highest level of protection.
  Senator LEAHY. Surpassing all other kinds of speech?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, we have had a lot of discussion here
about the impact of mandatory minimum penalties on the judici-
ary. We have passed a lot of laws in the Congress. We never have
Members of the Congress stand up and say they are in favor of
crime. Obviously, we are not. But usually in a spirit of showing just
how much we disfavor crime, we pass laws to say people shan't do
things, we say we will end crime by doubling the penalties or tri-
pling the penalties. Usually the word doesn't get to the criminal,
but it does make us feel better and it is nice at campaign time.
  But mandatory minimum penalties, some of which I liked when
I was a prosecutor, have now expanded greatly. Judge Billings, a
Federal judge I respect very much in my State, has written that
this type of statute denies that judges have a right to bring their
conscience, experience, discretion, and sense of what is just into the
sentencing procedure.
  Now, you must have had discussions of this issue both in your
own court and at judicial conferences. How do you feel about the
mandatory penalties? Are they putting too much discretion over
sentencing in the hands of prosecutors, and not in the hands of
judges?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Leahy, there was recently published a
very intelligent comment by Judge Weinstein of the Eastern Dis-
trict of New York concerning mandatory sentences. He rec-
ommended appointment of a commission to do a careful study of
how they are working out in practice.
  The perception is very strong among many judges--I know this
from conversations we have had at meetings of judges--that it is
                                      316
deceptive to think discretion has been removed. It has indeed been
removed from the sentencing judges, because mandatory mini-
mums don't give the judges any choice. If there is an indictment
for x amount of drug y and a conviction for that, then the sentence
will be 10 years mandatory or 5 years mandatory, based solely on
the character of the drug and the weight that the defendant was
charged with distributing.

  So the judges' sense is that the discretion has been transferred
from them to the prosecutor, who can choose to indict for a lesser
weight than the weight actually found at the time the defendant
was arrested. There is much concern that these mandatory mini-
mum sentences are transferring discretion from the judge to the
prosecutor and that they may be deceptive in other respects, be-
cause the likelihood of apprehension--not the sentence length--
may be the strongest deterrent. If someone is aware that the
chance of being caught is very high and the sentence is sure, even
if it is shorter, that awareness probably would be the greatest de-
terrent you could have.

  Senator LEAHY. I remember when I was a prosecutor, I used to
try to point out to legislative bodies--they say simply that their
idea of good law enforcement is to double the penalties--if you
have two buildings side-by-side, two warehouses, one with a very
good burglar alarm system on it and one without, which one gets
broken into? The penalty for breaking in is the same for either one
of them, but obviously they are going to break into the one without
the burglar alarm system, because you are not going to get caught
or you are less apt to get caught.

  I agree with you, it is the fear of apprehension, and then a pros-
ecution, but also it is finality, which goes into a whole other issue.
For whatever it is worth, I think that we have got to go back and
review this whole question of mandatory minimum sentences. I
think we have gotten too far down the road with it.

  Judge GlNSBURG. There has been enough experience with man-
datory minimum sentences by now to make that kind of close look
very valuable. I am sure the Federal Bureau of Prisons, too, would
have a large contribution to make, to tell the ramifications of a
burgeoning prison population. We went from a system where a sen-
tence was effectively one-third of the time imposed; you served one-
third of your time and then you were up for parole. Now there is
no parole. Your sentence is what you serve.

  So I think the time has come when a study, a close look at how
mandatory minimums have been working would make a contribu-
tion of great value.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, when you came before our committee be-
fore for confirmation to the court of appeals, we could ask you ques-
tions about Supreme Court cases and you could say, as you did in
one form or another, well, of course, if the Supreme Court has
ruled that way, as a court of appeals judge, I am bound by it, stare
decisis, and so on and so forth.

  You don't have those fetters if you go on the Supreme Court. I
looked back, and Justice Brandeis, in Burnett v. CoronadoOil and
Gas in 1932, talked about stare decisis, and he said, "In cases in-
volving the Federal Constitution, the Court bows to the lessons of
experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the
                                      317
process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is ap-
propriate also in the judicial function."

  I remember reciting that at different times when I was before
our State supreme court as a young lawyer, when I wanted them
to change past decisions.

  Would you agree with Justice Brandeis, that the lessons of expe-
rience can prevail in cases involving the Constitution?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, I do, but I also agree with something else
Justice Brandeis said in that very same opinion. He liked it so
much, that he said it twice. Because I was misquoted in my
quotation from Justice Brandeis by the press this morning, I would
like to repeat it. It says: "In matters of statutory interpretation, it
is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than
that it be settled right. This is commonly true," Brandeis contin-
ued, "even when the error is a matter of serious concern, provided
correction can be had by legislation." There he was making the dis-
tinction between construing legislation and constitutional interpre-
tation. The press missed that essential point by stopping the
quotation midstream.

  Senator LEAHY. They won't miss it twice, Judge. [Laughter.]
  Do you agree with that? Do you take that as your philosophy?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The statement that Brandeis made in Burnet
v. Coronado Oil (1932) and again in DiSanto v. Pennsylvania
(1927), yes. I have said so many times in print, quoting from Jus-
tice Brandeis. I believe, too, that stare decisis has an important
role in constitutional interpretation. With the possible exception of
the passage Senator Grassley read, I associate myself with what
was said in Casey about settled expectations. I think, in the case
of Brandeis, the overruling of Swift v. Tyson (1842) in Erie v.
Tompkins (1938) is illustration of when stare decisis must give
way.
  One doesn't lightly overrule precedent even in the constitutional
area. But Brandeis made an obvious point, although he said it so
well. Correction can come by legislation if the Court messes up on
a matter of statutory interpretation. That often can't be done when
the question is one of constitutional interpretation.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, but even that must have some changes.
For example, you could reverse an obscure technical decision of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. I don't mean to suggest they
are obscure or technical, but say some minor IRS point or some-
thing like that. That is one thing. Or you can let it stand even
though you don't think it creates justice. Or you could overturn a
case like Brown v. Board of Education or Taylor v. Louisiana.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Taylor v. Louisiana (1975)? Heaven forfend.
[Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. Well, I thought I would just--it is getting late
in the afternoon. I wanted to throw that one in.
  But you see what I am getting at. Can the Brandeis test always
be held? Sometimes the consequences might be horrendous. Is
there a point where the circumstances are such that you have to
strike out differently?
  Judge GlNSBURG. No doubt, and I think Brandeis was saying
that himself. He said this is commonly truly, not this is always
true.
                                      318
  Senator LEAHY. HOW much weight do you put on the extent to
which a holding has guided and been relied upon by the public? Is
that something that must weigh heavily on you if there is a body
of law that seems so settled that it has been well relied upon? I
am thinking now of the kind of thinking that must go through a
Supreme Court Justice's mind if they are going to overturn a past
decision of the Court. Are time and acceptance major factors to be
considered?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Yes, both are. How it has been working? What
expectations, what reliance interests has the decision generated?
Those are major factors.
  Senator LEAHY. Changed circumstances? A case that is settled in
one era looking different in another?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes. The period could even be 10 years. Al-
though I think the Supreme Court wrongly decided the women's
jury service issue in 1961, by the time of Taylor, in 1976, there was
a societal change that the Supreme Court came to understand.
True, it took 100 years, practically, for appreciation of the changing
position of women in society to be comprehended. But in the Taylor
(1975) case, it finally was comprehended. Taylor upset what had
been a unanimous precedent the other way.
  Senator LEAHY. Then, lastly, Judge, what if you as an individual
hold as your own moral belief that the earlier decision was wrong?
Does that go against all--what weight does that have against, for
example, some of the other things we have talked about--continu-
ity, acceptance?
  Judge GINSBURG. Well, that is why we have the law. That is why
we have a system of stare decisis. It keeps judges from infusing
their own moral beliefs, from making themselves kings or queens.
That accounts for my answer to a question I have been asked here
a few times. How do you feel about this or that? I responded that
how I feel is not relevant to the job for which you are considering
me.
  Senator LEAHY. Would it be safe to say, however, Judge, that it
can never totally disappear from your consideration?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, that 4s certainly true. I have to be aware
of it. I must know that it is there and guard against confusing my
own predilections with what is the law.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much. I see my friend from
Maine, Senator Cohen, is here, and I yield to him.
  Senator COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me explain, Mr.
Chairman, that I have been given sort of a Hobson's choice. If I
agree to be brief, we will continue with me. If I am not going to
be brief, then we will take a break, and I will probably lose my
turn.
  Senator LEAHY. I am always the last to hear these things, Sen-
ator Cohen.
  Senator COHEN. I will try to finish within 15 minutes. Is that
satisfactory?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think I can go 15 minutes, not a half-hour.
  Senator LEAHY. Just so I fully understand, we will go until 4
o'clock. Is that OK with you?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I think I can manage that all right.
                                      319
  Senator COHEN. I will try and compress what I was going to say,
and it may be more effective in that fashion, anyway.
  On the way out during the last break that we had over lunch-
time, I was asked the question, in essence: Why are you, meaning
the Senators, prolonging either the agony or the ecstasy, depending
upon one's viewpoint? The fact is that nothing that you say, Judge,
is likely to change the outcome of these proceedings, so why are we
continuing?
  My response is that there is, nonetheless, a very important func-
tion that is being served by the attempt to explore these particular
issues or cases with you. First, the general public, including us, I
might add, is unlikely to ever see you in the^future except on a per-
sonal appearance perhaps at some forum. So it is important that
they have some comprehension of exactly who is this individual we
are about to hand this scepter of power to. It is a very important
delegation of power to you as a future Supreme Court Justice. I
think it is important that they have an appreciation of the depth
of your comprehension and your competence and judicial philoso-
phy and general viewpoints.
  Second, it allows us to explore and develop issues with you to
perhaps sensitize you to some of the feelings that Members of the
Senate will not be in a position to indicate to you in the future. We
are unlikely to have any communication with you except perhaps
on a purely social basis, and even that is likely to be remote.
  The third, more cynical reason is that many here would like to
have more air time. But let me go quickly to the questions I have.
  I was curious in terms of your response to Senator Specter when
he inquired about your article, the one you wrote saying that dur-
ing the course of Judge Bork's confirmation hearing, the line be-
tween philosophy and votes tended to become blurred. Then you in-
dicated today that the article was not necessarily a criticism of the
committee but, rather, just a recognition of the morass into which
one can step, and the blame should be placed squarely upon the
nominee because you have an opportunity to say, Senator, I think
that that is an inappropriate question and I am not going to an-
swer it.
  What I gathered, however, from your testimony this morning is
that as a general proposition, if you have written about a subject,
if you have taught a subject, if you have lectured on a subject, even
though that subject matter may come before the Court at some fu-
ture time, you feel that it is legitimate to talk about it, for example,
abortion rights, equal rights amendments or other types of things
on which you have expressed a view publicly either as a judge or
as a professor or simply as an advocate. Is that correct?
  Judge GINSBURG. If I have written something, either an opinion
or an article, and you want to ask me about what I wrote, some-
thing you think should be clarified or questioned, then you can
confront me with my writing. Yes, I think that is right.
  Senator COHEN. Even though a permutation or some modification
of that issue might at some future time come before the Court.
That is a fair area for us to explore.
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Cohen, I have asked you to judge me
on the basis of my written record, and I have said what that record
                                              320

contains. So, yes. I regard this hearing as in the nature of an oral
argument where I can clarify what is in that written record.

  Now, it is true, as just occurred, that when one writes over 700
opinions in the course of 13 years, one must sometimes refresh
one's recollection. One of your colleagues just said to me, well, in
the case of United States v. Jackson (1987), you said such-and-so.
Another of your colleagues said, in the Xidex (1991) case, where
you were on the panel, the court unanimously ruled thus and so.
In both instances, I had to refresh my recollection.

  Senator COHEN. All right. Let me go to the Goldman case that
we have talked about so many times before. You joined Judge Starr
in his dissent.

  The case originally was heard, and then there was a request
made for a rehearing en bane, right?

  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator COHEN. In which case you wrote a very brief dissenting
opinion from the majority of the appellate court that refused a re-
hearing.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator COHEN. OK. This is the so-called yarmulke case that we
have been talking about the past 2 days.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator COHEN. Judge Starr's dissent I think is important, and
I am going to quote excerpts from it.
  He said:

  It cannot be gainsaid that the judiciary is singularly ill equipped to sit in judg-
ment on military personnel regulations. In matters touching upon the exigencies of
military affairs, the courts have wisely exercised the restraint and caution that be-
fits the unelected branch of Government.

  Then he cited Justice Jackson in terms of Jackson's comments
opposing the Korean conflict.

  The military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate dis-
cipline from that of the civilian. Orderly government requires that the judiciary be
as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate [military] matters as the [military]
must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.

  This is part of Judge Starr's dissent.
  He goes on to say, however, that

  The military's claim that flexibility generates resentment, whereas arbitrariness
keeps the corps content is utterly belled, however, by Dr. Goldman's own experience
in serving his country.

  He went on to say that

  Dr. Goldman has been required to render to Caesar far too much for far too little
reason.

  I think you associated yourself with the eloquence of those re-
marks, but you went on to say that

  A military commander has now declared intolerable the yarmulke that Dr. Gold-
man has worn without incident throughout his several years of military service, and
at least the declaration suggests callous indifference to his religious faith.

  That case went to the Supreme Court. By the way, Judge Scalia
joined with you in that dissent.

  Judge GINSBURG. Joined with me, right.
  Senator COHEN. That case went to the Supreme Court, and the
Supreme Court affirmed the military's position of denying Dr.
                                      321
Goldman the opportunity to wear the yarmulke that he had worn
for 13 or 15 years. The issue has been resolved, however, because
Congress subsequently passed an act.

  I am asking you this question because I would like to know your
opinion. If Congress had reaffirmed by statute the regulations of
the military relative to the wearing of religious apparel, would that
have changed, in your judgment, the constitutional protection af-
forded to Dr. Goldman under the first amendment? In other words,
Congress can enlarge the rights, but can it restrict them? What
would be your conclusion if Congress were to statutorily incor-
porate the regulations pertaining to the prohibition against wear-
ing a religious garment, for example?

  Judge GlNSBURG. If Congress had made a law in effect adopting
the uniform code the service had at; the time of Simcha Goldman's
case? If Congress had enacted the uniform code into law, then the
case would have come to Court challenging that law instead of the
uniform regulation, and the Court would have divided over the law,
as it did over the regulation. It would have been--was it five to up-
hold the regulation? It would have been five to uphold the law. I
imagine that the Court would have divided just the same way
whether the uniform code came up in the form of a regulation or
in the form of a law. Judge Starr was very clear that he would
have dissented.

  My position for myself and then Judge Scalia was that this was
a very important question, one that should be decided by the full
Court. I did not feel at liberty to write an opinion because I was
not on the original panel. I participated only at the petition for re-
hearing stage. I said we should rehear the case, and the full Court
should be briefed on the issue.

  But on your question, I think that the Court would have come
out the same way whether the challenged measure were a law or
a regulation.

  Senator COHEN. In other words, Congress cannot
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think Congress can enlarge, but it cannot
shrink.
  Senator COHEN. It cannot shrink. In other words, if the military
were to pass a regulation and Congress incorporates that by stat-
ute, if the Court decides that infringes upon a fundamental right
inherent in one of the amendments to the Constitution, the fact
that we had incorporated that by statute would give it no greater
weight. We can't restrict something that has been guaranteed by
the Constitution. We can only enlarge.
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think you can exercise your authority under
section 5 of the 14th amendment or under the necessary and prop-
er clause. There are many fountains of congressional authority to
expand rights.
  Senator COHEN. But we cannot restrict them in violation of the
Court's interpretation of what is a fundamental right.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Not unless the Court is to stop being the last
resort on questions of constitutional interpretation. Not unless we
are to overturn Marbury v. Madison (1803). The people do have an-
other resort. The Constitution can be amended. The Supreme Court
can be urged to rethink its decision.
                                              322

  Senator COHEN. Let me quote the language of the Supreme
Court in that particular case.

  But the First Amendment does not require the military to accommodate such
practices in the face of its view that they would detract from the uniformity sought
by dress regulations. The Air Force has drawn the line essentially between the reli-
gious apparel that is visible and that which is not, and we hold that those portions
of the regulations challenged here reasonably and evenhandedly regulate dress in
the interest of the military's perceived need for uniformity.

  That was the conclusion of the Court as recently as 1986. Cor-
rect?

  Judge GlNSBURG. That was the majority opinion in the Goldman
(1986) case.

  Senator COHEN. Right, and it was 5-to-4 decision.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. It becomes important because your elevation to
the Court would, in fact, have changed the outcome in that particu-
lar case. It might very well have a major impact on cases that will
be coming to the Court.
  I say this in connection, for example, with your own very heart-
felt and passionate feelings about discrimination in this country.
There is a debate taking place on the floor right now that deals
with a symbol, a symbol which is anathema to those of African-
American descent. It deals with a flag and a charter of a group
that has had that flag as its symbol for many years. Your feelings
about discrimination are terribly important. Today in response to
Senator Kennedy, you talked about discrimination, be it race dis-
crimination or based on religion, gender, or sexual orientation and
you said, "Rank discrimination is deplorable."
  I assume by the word "rank" you mean intentional or institu-
tional discrimination. Is that what you mean by rank?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I think base discrimination is deplorable
and against the spirit of this country. Discrimination, arbitrary dis-
crimination without reason----
  Senator COHEN. No. Does rank mean institutional discrimina-
tion? Does it mean intentional discrimination? Does it mean arbi-
trary discrimination? Because as I understand the Constitution, it
is permissible to discriminate or to classify provided there is a ra-
tional basis for it.
  Judge GINSBURG. If I discriminate against a person for reasons
that are irrelevant to that person's talent or ability, that is what
I meant when I said rank discrimination. Arbitrary discrimination,
unrelated to a person's ability or worth, unrelated to a person's tal-
ent, discrimination simply because of who that person is and not
what that person can do.
  Senator COHEN. Or what that person does. In other words, you
draw it upon a person's status or conduct? Would there be a dif-
ference, in your judgment?
  Judge GINSBURG. A person's birth status should not enter into
the way that person is treated. A person who is born into a certain
home with a certain religion or is born of a certain race, those are
characteristics irrelevant to what that person can do or contribute
to society.
  Senator COHEN. What about sexual orientation?
                                               323

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, you know that is a burning question
virtually certain to come before the Court. I cannot address that
question without violating what I said had to be my rule about no
hints, no forecasts, no previews.

  Senator COHEN. It seemed to me that you already did comment
on that when you responded to Senator Kennedy this morning. He
talked about race, religion, and gender and sexual orientation. I
think your comment was rank discrimination is deplorable under
all of those

  Judge GINSBURG. I think rank discrimination for any reason,
hair color, eye color, you name it, rank discrimination is un-Amer-
ican. There must be a reason, as you said, for any classification.
Government can't take action

  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield on that one point for clari-
fication?We have used the phrase----

  Senator COHEN. I have to wrap it very quickly. I promise I will
be very brief.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Senator COHEN. I am sure she will clarify this as we go through.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Senator COHEN. I believe that this issue is important, and your
own experience and the passion with which you feel and express
that past experience is important. I am not trying to, in any way,
get you to commit how you are going to decide a case but, rather,
to understand what you mean by rank discrimination being deplor-
able and perhaps unconstitutional in certain circumstances. I was
curious in connection with your feeling in the Goldman case be-
cause there the Supreme Court in a 5-to-4 decision clearly indi-
cated that it deferred to the military to engage in what clearly was
a prohibition on a fundamental right, the wearing of a religious
garment.
  You and Judge Starr felt quite strongly, and I suspect Judge
Scalia also felt strongly, that this did not meet the rational test
basis.
  At the time, the Supreme Court disagreed. Now we are going to
have a new Supreme Court Justice, so I wanted to clarify what you
meant by rank discrimination.
  Judge GINSBURG. May I just say one further word about the
Goldman case?
  Senator COHEN. Surely.
  Judge GINSBURG. The panel of the District of Columbia Circuit
that decided the Goldman (1986) case said the very nature of a
uniform regulation is its arbitrariness. That panel, as you know,
was among the most "liberal" benches one could draw, if one labels
judges liberal or conservative. Those three judges stressed the nec-
essarily arbitrary nature of military uniform regulations. The panel
was dealing with a discrete category; the opinion was not meant to
spill over to any other area. Military uniforms could be arbitrary.
That, in sum, was the decision of the panel of my court in
  Senator COHEN. The Court was saying that the military regula-
tion was necessary in order to maintain uniformity. It was an issue
of diversity and uniformity, and the Court deferred to the military
in that case. That issue is obviously going to be before us and it
is going to be before you, I suspect, at some future time. I just
                                               324

wanted to explore with you your feeling about rank discrimination
being deplorable. It is always deplorable. The question is, is it
going to be constitutional under some circumstances.

  Let me conclude. I made a pledge, Mr. Chairman, that we would
break by 4, and I am already a minute or two over. I just wanted
to conclude with an observation. I may not have an opportunity to
come back and to participate further, Judge.

  I know that you are a great student of Holmes. In fact, I was
pleased that you placed him in the pantheon of your heroes on the
judiciary, at least as far as those of the 19th and early part of the
20th century who are no longer with us.

  Holmes wrote a letter to Cardozo, and Cardozo said it was one
of his most prized possessions. In this letter, Holmes said:

  I have always thought that not power or place or popularity brings one the suc-
cess that one desires, but the trembling hope that one has come near to an ideal.
The only thing that warrants us for not believing that we are living in a fool's para-
dise is the voice of a few masters, and I feel it so much I don't want to talk about
it any more.

  I hope that you will have this place, obviously, and the power
and perhaps even the popularity. I hope that you will hold onto
that ideal that Holmes spoke of and lived, and that you pay heed
to those voices of the few masters that you cited as being among
your heroes.

  Judge GINSBURG. I hope so, too.
  Senator COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator I was necessarily absent on the floor debating an amend-
ment, I understand that you limited yourself to 4 o'clock, to accom-
modate the witness.
  Senator COHEN. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. But I want you to know that, after we break, if
you have more questions, you can continue, because we indicated
that we would give people up to half an hour, if they wanted it.
It is up to you. I know you have other things you have to do, as
well.
  Senator COHEN. We have an Armed Services Committee markup
going on right now. Senator Brown was kind enough to let me go
first, so I think I will wait until we complete another round.
  The CHAIRMAN. The reason I attempt to interrupt, Judge--and I
will recess in 60 seconds--is that when discussion was made about
discrimination, the phrase used by the Senator was "the govern-
ment has a rational basis," and I did not want to let that stand.
  Once the Court has concluded that a group is in a suspect cat-
egory, they require strict scrutiny, not a rational basis, is that not
correct? If you make a distinction based on race, race is in a sus-
pect category, the government has to have more than a rational
basis, does it not, to make a distinction based on race?
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Race classifications are
subject to strict scrutiny, and the State must have a compelling in-
terest to justify such a classification. We have not seen such an in-
terest in some time.
  The CHAIRMAN. I wasn't saying that in any way to imply that
you didn't know that, Judge. You have that professorial look at this
moment, and I feel mildly intimidated. [Laughter.]
                                                325

  Senator COHEN. It is called a prosecutorial look, not professorial.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, the prosecutorial one doesn't bother me. The
professorial one does bother me.
  There may be two votes at 4:15, beginning at 4:15, and so I will
recess until 25 after, unless there is an ongoing vote, in which case
we will not reconvene until the vote has been concluded.
  [A short recess was taken.]
  Senator DECONCINI [presiding]. The committee will be in order.
  With the concurrence of the chairman, Judge Ginsburg, we will
go ahead and proceed. I know the day is getting long and I am sure
you could find something else to do.
  Judge I have paid some attention to your remarks, although I
have not been here, and I appreciate your openness and candidness
with the committee. I know you have gone over this subject matter.
I just want to touch on it a little bit more, because it is troubling
to me.
  I want to go back over the issue you discussed with Senator
Cohen yesterday. He asked you about the use of legislative history
and statutory construction. Over the last few Supreme Court
terms, almost 50 percent of the Supreme Court cases have involved
issues of statutory interpretation and, thus, it has become more im-
portant to know a nominee's approach, and you have expressed
that quite clearly.
  During yesterday's hearing you told Senator Cohen that you do
look at the legislative history, when the text is not clear. I was also
encouraged to hear you tell Senator Kohl that you do not feel safe
on "the same island of legislative intent" as Justice Scalia. Now,
Justice Scalia is a proponent of so-called textualism. He attempts
to limit the statutory interpretation to the text and ignores the leg-
islative history. He does not look at committee reports, he does not
look at congressional debate. Rather, he has decided that he will
just look at the statute to determine congressional intent.
  Now, congressional legislative history is not always clear, I am
very cognizant of that, but I believe that ignoring it per se is a
form of judicial activism, however you may define that term of art,
that goes beyond what is acceptable. But there isn't anything we
can do about judges who have been confirmed and sit there.
  During his confirmation hearing, I asked Judge Souter his ap-
proach to legislative history. He stated the need to rely upon legis-
lative history, when attempting to derive the meaning of an un-
clear statute. His approach on the Court has been consistent with
his testimony.
  Judge Thomas, on the other hand, told Senator Grassley during
his confirmation hearing that a judge must "look to legislative his-
tory, we look to debate on the floor, of course, we look to committee
reports, conference reports, we look to the best indications of what
your intent was." However, in direct contradiction of that testi-
mony, while on the Court, Justice Thomas has adopted the Scalia
approach to legislative intent. For example--and there are several
of them--Thomas alone concurred with Justice Scalia in the opin-
ion last year, in which Scalia stated that reliance on legislative his-
tory was inappropriate.
  Judge Ginsburg, interpreting statutes is a difficult process. Many
statutes are subject to many different interpretations. If legislative
                                                326

history is ignored altogether, what is a judge left with, in interpret-
ing the vast number of statutes? Is there anything logically that
you could do, other than look at the history of the legislation? I am
just quite perplexed by Judge Scalia's, and what appears to be
Judge Thomas', leaning.

  I am not asking you to get into any fray with your future col-
leagues, if you are confirmed, but I just wonder, where else could
you look?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Another source we look to as a way of deter-
mining congressional meaning is familiar canons of construction,
like exceptions to the antitrust laws are to be strictly construed,
like the specific prevails over the general

  Senator DECONCINI. General principles that you would look at.
Not looking at the legislative history, and I realize it is certainly
not binding, seems to me to may be a trend in the judiciary. As a
scholar yourself and a judge, but more as a scholar, do you think
it is a trend to go away from legislative history, or just a phenom-
ena?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I don't see it as a trend in the Federal courts
generally. Your colleague Senator Grassley was good enough to
supply me with one of my decisions that I didn't remember until
he handed it to me, United States v. Jackson, a 1987 decision of
mine. I think it is typical. Yesterday, I tried to sum up how I ap-
proach legislative history. I said that I consult legislative history
with an attitude of hopeful skepticism.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, I saw that.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Jackson is a typical case where I said the stat-
utory language we are obliged to construe is not free from ambigu-
ity, and in light of the textual ambiguity, we must look elsewhere
for clues to the legislators' intent. The legislative history of the act,
while itself not free of ambiguity, which is often the case, offered
more support for one position than for the other. I then referred to
the Senate report and the House report, and continued for a page
and a half citing material from the legislative history.
  Senator DECONCINI. I guess in answer to my question, you don't
think it is a trend, or do you have an opinion which you care to
give, as to it being textualism or a veering away from legislative
history?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I think a judge must try to find out what the
legislature meant. One hopes Congress' meaning will be clear on
the face of the statute, and it sometimes is. It sometimes is not,
however. Then, I think, a judge will want to consult all of the
sources that bear on the question, what does the statute mean. I
also said yesterday that some parts of legislative history are more
reliable than other parts. If everything in the legislative history
goes one way, you feel more comfortable than you do when one
statement goes one way and another statement goes another way.
  To answer the question, what did the legislature mean, if it is
not clear from the text, we need help, and legislative history can
be a source of help that should be considered.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge. I think that is quite ade-
quate and I appreciate your response. I am sorry to drag you
through that subject matter again, but I couldn't get it off my
mind.
                                               327

  Judge Ginsburg, the famous case of Miranda v. Arizona, as you
so well know, defined the parameters of police conduct for interro-
gating suspects held in custody. Since that decision, the Supreme
Court has limited the scope of Miranda in certain cases. The proc-
ess might be termed as kind of chipping away at it. Miranda, like
the exclusionary rule, is a pragmatic rule that the Court adopted
to provide better administration of constitutional rights.

  I am interested in your opinion, if you would share with us:
Should the Court be in the business of adopting pragmatic rules?

  Judge GINSBURG. The purpose of the Miranda warnings is to
make certain that a defendant's rights are known to the defendant,
so the defendant can exercise them--the right not to speak and the
information that, if you do, your words can be used against you,
the right to an attorney and the knowledge that if you are unable
to pay for counsel, a lawyer will be provided for you by the State.
Those, it seems to me, are constitutional rights that should be
brought home to every defendant.

  Now, sophisticated defendants will know them without being
told, but the unsophisticated won't. This practical approach, the
Miranda warnings, has become familiar to all, thanks to television.
I think it has worked.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU think it is a proper area for the Court
to be involved in, certainly in the Miranda case, I suspect you do,
but just in general of putting forth pragmatic rules?

  Judge GINSBURG. In a situation like this, where the object is to
ensure that a defendant knows about the right to counsel, knows
that the defendant is not obliged to incriminate herself or himself,
these are salutary rules that have safeguarded the constitutional
right. Frankly, from my point of view, it makes the system run bet-
ter because then one need not ask case-by-case: Did this defendant
know that he had a right to counsel? Did he intelligently waive
that right?

  It avoids controversies. It is an assurance that people know their
rights. It is an assurance that the law is going to be administered
even-handedly, because, as I said, sophisticated defendants who
have counsel ordinarily will know about their rights, so it is an as-
surance of the even-handed administration of justice.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, let me go to another subject. I have
been involved in this subject matter for a long time; it is judicial
discipline. Had I been the member of the committee who heard
your nomination some 13 years ago, I would have asked you this
question. I was not, to my recollection.

  So I would like to just give you some background of my interest.
There are now 842 Federal judgeships. We are expecting that to in-
crease to more than a thousand in the next decade, many more
than the Framers of the Constitution I think ever possibly thought
we would have.

  The impeachment process is the only avenue to remove a judge.
As we all know, the impeachment process is slow and cumbersome.
It is left to the most egregious cases, some argue without adequate
due process. Prior to 1986, the Senate hadn't heard an impeach-
ment trial for 50 years, and since then there have been three. Fur-
thermore, there are two more judges who have failed to resign, al-
though they have been convicted. If only a fraction of the number
                                      328

of sitting judges are accused of misconduct, the Congress could be
just inundated with impeachment proceedings on an annual basis.

  There have been a number of proposed constitutional amend-
ments introduced over the years to address this problem. One ap-
proach would require that an article III judge who is convicted of
a felony and has exhausted all appeals forfeit his or her office and
all the benefits thereto.

  Another approach would give Congress the power to legislatively
set standards and guidelines by which the Supreme Court could
discipline judges who have brought disrepute on the Federal courts
or the administration of justice.

  As a judge, do you think the impeachment process serves as a
great enough deterrent to prevent the misconduct of judges? Is that
a threat to a judge or intimidation at all in the process of a judge's
conduct?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator DeConcini, I am afraid that there may
be a real conflict of interest, possibility of bias and prejudice on my
part. I am a member of the third branch of government; I prize my
independence and the tenure I hold during good behavior. I think
that Federal judges take their oaths to heart. Of course, there is
always the rare exception, and I think it remains the very rare ex-
ception, even though, as the numbers go up, there is going to

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me put it this way, Judge: Do you think
there is any merit to a process within the judicial branch of govern-
ment, which under a constitutional amendment, would permit the
removal of a judge?

  In other words, what if a constitutional amendment set up or
gave authority to the judicial branch to set up procedures where
complaints could be heard? A judge would have an opportunity to
respond and to have a hearing and to appeal the hearing, and what
have you, and the Supreme Court or somebody within the judicial
branch could, in fact, dismiss the judge. Have you given that any
thought?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I understand that the Kastenmeier Commis-
sion has been looking into the discipline and tenure of judges. The
Commission has published a preliminary draft of its report. The
Commission has been operating for some time; it has broad charter
to take a careful look at all these areas. I will read the final report
when it comes out with great interest, but I don't feel equipped to
address that subject.

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me ask you this: Is it offensive to you,
if the judiciary had authority to discipline judges and that dis-
cipline could also include dismissal?

  Judge GlNSBURG. We already have an in-house complaint proce-
dure, as you know.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, I do.
  Judge GlNSBURG. And I think it has worked rather well. In all
my years on the District of Columbia Circuit, no complaint has
warranted a call for removal.
  Senator DECONCINI. My problem, Judge, is what do you do with
a convicted judge? Wouldn't it be appropriate for the judiciary to
have a process where they could expel that judge? I mean I am giv-
ing you the worst of all examples. I am not talking about the liti-
                                      329

gant who is unsatisfied, doesn't like the ruling of the judge and,
thereby, files a complaint as to moral turpitude of the judge, and
then you have a hearing on that. I am talking about something
that is so dramatic as a felony conviction of a judge.

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator, I appreciate the concern you are
bringing up. It isn't hypothetical. There are judges who are in that
situation. They are rare, one or two in close to a thousand.

  Senator DECONCINI. I think there are two.
  Judge GINSBURG. SO I appreciate the problem. When I was asked
before about cameras in the courtroom, I was careful to qualify my
own view. I said I would, of course, give great deference to the
views of my colleagues on this subject. An experiment is going on
right now in the Federal courts on that subject.
  I don't feel comfortable expressing my own view, without infor-
mation concerning the view of the U.S. Judicial Conference on this
subject. I know that the judges are going to study the Kastenmeier
report, and they are going to react to it. I can just say that I appre-
ciate it is a very grave problem.
  Senator DECONCINI. I won't beat it any further. It has troubled
me and been a problem that I have dealt with here. I have legisla-
tion and constitutional amendments trying to get the court to be
a bit more aggressive. They have set up the circuit disciplinary
complaint procedures or whatever they are called, and there are
some studies that show that they actually have taken some action.
  What concerns me is all branches of government are suspect
today, I think, by the public for a lot of reasons, some of it our own
doing and some may be exaggeration by the press or whatever. And
I am just trying to find a solution that would give more credibility
to the judiciary. I would like to find that same solution for the leg-
islative branch, but I am just really kind of grasping for thoughts
and ideas without wanting to put you in an embarrassing situation
that, my goodness sakes, what if the Judicial Conference turns
down Kastenmeier or adopts it. And I am not absolutely sure what
is in it, but I don't believe it goes near as far as I have suggested.
And I was really looking for an opinion of a judge. I can probably
find some other judges, and I have on many occasions, and most
of them don't want it. Most of the judges I talk to that are personal
friends of mine or people that I have been involved with for years
in the judicial system, they just say no. Although, you know, can-
didly, some of them will say, yes, we should do that but it is impos-
sible for us to do that, such as the charge or the opinion sometimes
it is impossible for us in the Senate to criticize and really review
our own conduct.
  I am just looking for some thoughts on it without putting you in
an embarrassing position because that is not my intent. And if you
don't care to comment any further, I will let it go. I am just very
frustrated about it. For almost 15 years now, I have tried to see
and encourage the courts to be more involved in it, and going
through the impeachment process here, it only frustrates me more
because of our lack of being able to address that in a better proce-
dural way.
  Judge GINSBURG. Just as Members of Congress prize their speech
or debate immunity, so judges prize their independence, the guar-
antee that they shall hold office during good behavior.
                                               330

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge. I will try another judge.
[Laughter.]

  I have enjoyed, Judge, your frankness, and I want to compliment
you again for it as we conclude my second round. I appreciate your
attempt to be open with us and convey your views as much as you
can. That is important to this Senator. I find this process not just
fun, but trying to get inside the mind of a nominee to the Supreme
Court without violating their oath and their potential conflicts,
what have you, Js fascinating, intellectually challenging, and very
rewarding when you are as candid as you have been. And Judge
Souter and others have fallen into that category.

  As you noted in your opening statement, we hold these hearings
to aid us in the performance of our task. I take it very seriously.
I really don't think there is anything more important that I do as
a Senator than addressing nominees to the bench, and particularly
to the SupremeTCourt. The advice and consent duties here are ex-
tremely important, and I think Chairman Biden and the ranking
member have certainly demonstrated that we take it seriously. And
I know the nominees do.

  If confirmed, our Constitution will endow you with immense
power, and there is no doubt in this Senator's mind that you are
well aware_of_that, having served as long as you have, and there
is no doubt in my mind that you will take it extremely seriously
and in a very wise manner. And I .anticipate, unless something
comes out in these hearings or in other procedures prior to the re-
port of this committee, that you will be confirmed. And you have
certainly demonstrated, I think, to the public and to this committee
your knowledge of the law, your ability to be straightforward, your
consciousness-and sensitivity toward delicate issues that might
come before the Court. And I give you high praise, Judge, for what-
ever that may be worth.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Thank you.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Thank you so much, Senator. I appreciate
those kind words.
  Senator DECONCINI. The Senator from South Dakota is recog-
nized. Senator Pressler? North Dakota, not South Dakota.
  Senator PRESSLER. Thank you very much.
  Judge Ginsburg, I will take up where I left off yesterday. I have
reviewed the answers to some of your questions in the area of In-
dian Country law and have found them lacking, very frankly, in
terms of what some of the tribal leaders are looking for.
  Let me say that many States west of the Mississippi are very in-
volved in litigation, whether it is California or any of the States
that have reservations or tribes or whatever they are referred to,
as California uses a different name. I am told that 10 percent of
all the cases decided by the Supreme Court last year involved In-
dian law questions, and it is a matter of growing concern with In-
dian gaming issues throughout the country, with issues of tribal
lands, with issues of civil rights of Indian people. And yesterday
you frequently responded by saying that Congress is responsible.
And, indeed, it is and I am a great critic of Congress for not acting
more.
                                      331
  But on the other hand, 80 years ago Congress passed a law re-
garding property rights and deeded land, and courts have ruled on
the issue. In the last 10 or 15 years, there has been probably more
law made by the Supreme Court and the courts regarding tribal
law than has been made by Congress. That is probably not appro-
priate, but it is the way things have been done. I am a great critic
of Congress, and Congress should do more. But in some cases, Con-
gress has taken action and passed legislation, such as regarding
patented deeded land, but the courts have ruled otherwise.
  Congress has taken steps regarding the codification of tribal
court decisions. Except for the Navajos, there is no judicial codifica-
tion of tribal court decisions and no judicial training involved. The
National Farmers Union Insurance case in the Supreme Court cre-
ated such a situation of confusion that tribal leaders tell me insur-
ance is hard to obtain on the reservations.
  The case in Wisconsin where a Federal judge decided against
congressional actions regarding fishing rights, where there had
never been any history of netting fish, suddenly a district judge
ruled that certain areas had to be set aside for netting fish at great
expense to the State of Wisconsin. And this is a judicial decision
without Congress acting.
  Many of these are social policy decisions made by district court
judges and appealed, and they end up in the Supreme Court. It is
amazing the number of tribal laws and tribal matters that end up
in the Supreme Court. As I said, it appears the Supreme Court,
you can correct me on this, only takes about 100 or so cases a year,
and perhaps 10 percent of those decided each year deal with Indian
law.
  I guess tribal leaders want to know--they want to get some feel-
ing, and you have expressed your feelings in other areas--what it
is that you know about Indian law, your familiarity from your
years of teaching and from your years on the bench. They want to
get a feel for your thinking.
  Can you give us some response?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Pressler, I would bring to this area of
the law the same care and the same thought I bring to the vast
array of Federal law I have handled in the last 13 years on the Dis-
trict of Columbia Circuit. I did not have any familiarity with In-
dian law as a student. I didn't take any course on that subject in
law school. I did not teach in that area. I have not written in that
area. That is true of most of the business I have handled on the
District of Columbia Circuit, and it is true of most of my col-
leagues. With the wealth of Federal law, none of us can possibly
be specialists in most of the cases that come before us.
  I have had to deal with many cases involving complex questions
about the environment, about surface mining, for example, cases
using terms I had never heard of before I got the particular case.
But then I boned up as hard as I could, with the information from
the record, the information supplied to me by the capable attorneys
in each case. And although I felt very much at a loss at the start,
by the time I reached the point of making a decision I felt confident
that I knew what was necessary to make a sound decision. And I
would bring that same approach and hard work to bear on this
question.
                                                332

  In fact, one of my colleagues, who observed the questions you
asked me yesterday; was it yesterday? When I got back to Cham-
bers, had placed an article on my desk, with a note that said, "In
view of the questions you have been asked, I regret that I did not
send this to you earlier." And it is a fine article called "Criminal
Jurisdiction on the North Carolina Cherokee Indian Reservation: A
Tangle of Race and History." It is by my colleague, David Sentelle.
So there are in many parts of the country, as you have indicated,
these very complex problems.

  I cannot pretend to any special knowledge in this area of the law,
but I can undertake that I will approach it in the same way I have
approached all other difficult areas I have had to confront in my
13 years on the District of Columbia Circuit.

  Senator PRESSLER. I did raise this issue, so I am not surprising
you with questions here. I did raise it when you were in my office,
and I sent you a series of questions that I would ask in advance.

  But, in any event, I have got two or three questions here, and
then I will conclude this area of questions. It isn't that I expect you
to know detailed things about Indian law, but it is the basics that
concern me. It is what the tribal leaders, non-Indians, Western
States, and the State attorneys general are concerned with. The
Western States attorneys general have meetings on these issues
frequently.

  Yesterday in your answers to my line of questions in regard to
Indian sovereignty, Indian civil rights, tribal jurisdiction, and law
enforcement in Indian country, you were very consistent in stating
your view that Congress has full power, or plenary power, over In-
dian affairs, and that the Federal courts will follow the policy Con-
gress sets in this area.

  I guess the point I am trying to make here is that in many cases
where Congress has acted, the courts in the last few years have
overruled, in such as the deeded and patented land cases, the Wis-
consin case, the insurance case, and so forth. Indeed, the courts
have felt an obligation to act.

  I am interested in finding out what you believe to be the limits
on Congress' power when dealing with Indian affairs or courts.
While it is true that Congress has plenary power in this area, the
Court has not been clear identifying the source of Congress' power
in this area. Early cases attributed this power to the treaty clause
of the Constitution, the property clause, and the war power.

  In an 1886 case, United States v. Kagama, the Supreme Court
attributed the power to enact a major crimes act to the trust rela-
tionship. The Court rejected the Indian commerce clause as a basis
because crimes are not commerce.

  However, in a 1973 case, McClanahan v. State Tax Commis-
sioner, the Court acknowledged the confusion regarding the source
of Federal authority over Indian matters. It rejected the trust rela-
tionship as a source of congressional power and instead recognized
that such power derives from the language in the commerce clause
dealing with Indian tribes and from Federal treatymaking author-
ity.

  Now, I guess my questions are: To what do you attribute Con-
gress' plenary power over Indian matters? And does the source of
the authority vary with the subject matter of the legislation?
                                               333

  Judge GINSBURG. The Supreme Court has said repeatedly that
Congress has full power over Indian affairs. A major source of that
authority is, of course, article I, section 8, where the power is
lodged in Congress. It surely is not lodged in the courts. The one
thing that is clear is that the courts are obliged faithfully to follow
the treaties and laws in this area as set by Congress. The courts
do not have any law-creation role to play. This is not a common law
area. This is an area for Congress to control. It is a very difficult
area, and the courts will have construction questions presented to
them. But that the Congress has the lead role and not the courts
I think is plain.

  I have done my best, Senator, to answer your questions on this
subject. As I have explained, a judge works from a specific case. I
have said that in answer to a number of your questions. I can't an-
swer abstract inquiries even in areas I have studied. I can't answer
an abstract issue. I work from a specific case based on the record
of that case, the briefs that are presented, the parties' presen-
tations, and decide the case in light of that record, those briefs. I
simply cannot, even in areas that I know very well, answer an
issue abstracted from a concrete case. That is not the way a judge
works.

  Senator PRESSLER. It is the feeling of many tribal leaders that
the courts currently make more law on reservations than does Con-
gress, because of court rulings and the Congress' inaction. So they
are very interested in what goes on in the court system, because
that is where most of the new law comes from.

  My second question--as you may know, many members of Indian
tribes, in their relations with their tribes, do not enjoy the protec-
tions other Americans have through the Constitution's Bill of
Rights. They have a statutory bill of rights which Congress en-
acted, but it is not as complete as the Constitution's Bill of Rights.

  Yesterday, I asked you whether the Native Americans are enti-
tled to the same constitutional protection in Federal courts afforded
to all American citizens. You answered, "All I can say is that Con-
gress does have the full power over Indian affairs, and the Federal
courts will follow the policy that Congress sets in this area."

  My question is, If you feel Congress has full power over Indian
tribes, you must regard Congress' abrogation of the U.S. Supreme
Court's decision in Duro as constitutional, even though it delegated
criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians who do not have con-
stitutional bill of rights protection against the authority of the
tribe. Would that be a fair interpretation of your view?

  Judge GINSBURG. I have no question about the authority of Con-
gress to override the Supreme Court decision in Duro v. Reina
(1990).

  Senator PRESSLER. Are there any limits to Congress' power to
delegate to the tribes criminal or civil jurisdiction over non-Indi-
ans?

  Judge GINSBURG. I can only repeat the answer that I gave you,
Senator Pressler, that Congress has full power over Indian affairs.
There is no restriction on a Native American to live in any commu-
nity that he or she chooses. So we are discussing only the difficult
concept of tribal sovereignty and how Congress has chosen to treat
that. I certainly didn't mean to suggest that a Native American
                                                334

outside of a tribal setting doesn't have the same rights as you and
I do.

  Senator PRESSLER. Are you uncomfortable that the Constitution's
Bill of Rights does not extend to Native Americans?

  Judge GlNSBURG. I can't express my personal view on that sub-
ject. I know that there are many people who care deeply about the
concept of tribal sovereignty. I am not a member of one of those
communities and, as a judge, I will do my best to apply faithfully
and fairly the policy that Congress sets with respect to tribal gov-
ernance.

  Senator PRESSLER. I have been informed that Indian tribes, the
tribal leadership--and this is complained about by some of the trib-
al members--successfully convinced the American Civil Liberties
Union not to take cases regarding the civil rights of Indian tribal
members in their relations with their tribes. As I said earlier, Indi-
ans in their relations with their tribes have only limited statutory
bill of rights protections and do not have the full panoply of con-
stitutional rights available to most Americans.

  Given these circumstances and I believe your prior involvement
with the ACLU in winning civil rights cases involving sex discrimi-
nation, are you aware of any ACLU policy or understanding re-
garding taking cases involving the civil rights of Indians in their
relationships with the tribes, and, if so, what was that policy or un-
derstanding or your reaction to it?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I have no knowledge or recollection of
any policy of the kind that you have just described.

  Senator PRESSLER. My final question in this area: Yesterday, I
asked you a question on an Indian tribe's ability to impose fines
and forfeiture against non-Indians who reside on a reservation with
regard to activities on the land owned by non-Indians. Again, you
answered this was an area that is particularly committed to the
judgment of Congress.

  My questions are, do non-Indians have any due process rights or
property rights which they can assert against the authority of the
tribal government? And, two, similarly, what due process rights are
guaranteed to Indians who are not members of the tribe against a
tribal government?

  Judge GlNSBURG. The authority of the tribal courts is something
for Congress to decide. I believe that was my answer yesterday.
Those courts will have such authority as Congress chooses to give
them, and judges are bound to respect the decisions Congress has
made.

  Senator PRESSLER. The problem is that the courts have fre-
quently overruled or defined Congress' mandates. Of course, I sup-
pose it is Congress' fault, in the sense that maybe it should pass
another law. But much of this ends up in the Supreme Court and
the Supreme Court makes the law. That is the way it seems to a
lot of people living in the West.

  Judge GlNSBURG. But the Supreme Court, as any court, has an
obligation to construe and apply the laws Congress passes faith-
fully, and on whatever court I serve that would be my endeavor,
no matter what area of the law.

  Senator PRESSLER. That concludes my questions. Thank you very
much.

  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  Senator SIMON. The Chairman is tied up and I am going to
  The CHAIRMAN. Please go right ahead.
  Senator SIMON. All right.
  Judge, you and your family will be pleased to know in the second
round I have only one question.
  Judge GINSBURG. Yes, I am pleased. [Laughter.]
  Senator SlMON. You will bring to the Court more background in
international law than any other member of the Court. You will
certainly be the only member of the Court who has ever translated
Swedish law into English, I am absolutely positive of that. Though,
come to think about it, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is a very
Swedish name, and he may
  Judge GINSBURG. Swedish or Norwegian.
  Senator SlMON. He is Norwegian?
  Judge GINSBURG. It could be. Swedish or Norwegian, I don't
know.
  Senator SIMON. It sounds Swedish, but we will have to check
that very important question. [Laughter.]
  The U.S. Supreme Court, in what I think was a terrible 6-to-3
decision, the Alvarez decision, said that the FBI could legally go
into another country and kidnap someone, because the kidnaping
was not covered by the extradition law. It is the only case I can
think of where every country around the world condemned what we
did, and Senator Moynihan and I have legislation in to make sure
this doesn't happen again.
  Article VI of the Constitution, as you know, says treaties made
or which shall be made under the authority of the United States
shall be the supreme law of the land. I do not want to ask you
about the Alvarez case, because I am sure you would, understand-
ably, decline to comment on that.
  But if you would comment on the general theory that because
something is not covered in an extradition treaty--and you have
had, at least my staff has discovered at least seven cases where
you have been involved in international law on the appeals court,
and one, Ward v. Rutherford, in 1991, involved extradition law--
if an extradition treaty does not cover going in and kidnaping
someone, or if a country owes us some money, does not cover going
in and robbing a bank or any number of illegal activities, what is
your opinion about the legality of our doing things that are under-
stood by all the countries of the world to be in violation of inter-
national law?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Simon, I can only tell you the code of
conduct I would adopt for myself wherever I am, here or abroad,
and that is the Constitution of the United States. I would consider
it binding on me.
  I can perhaps cite an example. There is a good book called "Judg-
ment in Berlin," written by a former Federal judge, Judge Stern,
who was sent to judge a hijacking case in Berlin. It was a sensitive
case in the international community. A plane was hijacked from
Poland, I believe, to take people who had been in East Germany
into West Germany. The hijacking presented a sensitive question
within Germany. So a court that had been created in World War
                                               336

II, called the United States Court for Berlin, was resurrected, and
a U.S. district judge, Judge Stern, was sent there.

  He was told by the State Department that the alleged hijackers
would have only such rights as the State Department chose to give
them. Judge Stern said, I am a Federal judge, the Constitution is
my law, and that is the law I am going to apply in any proceeding
over which I preside.

  He made sure that defendants had very able counsel--there were
two defendants--and that they got the full panoply of rights we ac-
cord criminal defendants. He did something remarkable in a coun-
try that does not use juries. He insisted that there be a jury trial.
The case was tried under German law, under German substantive
law, but according to U.S. procedures. And that procedural law was
largely determined by the rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitu-
tion. It is a wonderful example, I think, of the way any Federal of-
ficial should behave at home or abroad. The Constitution and the
Federal law should be our guide wherever we are.

  Senator SIMON. If I could get you to be a little more specific here,
if I can ask, not in commenting on the substance of the Alvarez
case--incidentally, he was tried in the United States and not found
guilty--but were you at all startled, when you heard about the re-
sults of the Alvarez case?

  Judge GlNSBURG. If I may, Senator, I would not like to comment
on my personal reactions to that case. I think I told you what my
view is on how U.S. officials should behave, and I would like to
leave it at that. You have cited a decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court. I have tried religiously to refrain from commenting on a
number of Court decisions raised in these last couple of days.

  Senator SIMON. I understand. Let me just say that I hope you
were startled, and my hope is that this particular case--first, I
hope we overturn it in Congress, so that this cannot happen again.
But the fact that an extradition treaty doesn't spell out that we
can't go in and kidnap people in another country or we can't rob
banks or we can't do all kinds of other things doesn't give us the
authority to do those things. My hope is that this is one case
where, if we don't pass something in Congress, that you will not
let precedent stand in the way of what the international commu-
nity believes is in our best interest.

  If I may add one other thing, Mr. Chairman, that has nothing
to do with this procedure: I was over on the floor of the Senate,
and I believe you were, too, when our colleague Senator Heflin
made a speech that took an incredible amount of courage. I just
want him to know I have never been prouder to serve in the U.S.
Senate than when I heard that speech.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  I, too, heard that speech and, for the public listening to this, the
Senator made a very moving and eloquent speech, as a son of the
Confederacy, acknowledging that it was time to change and yield
to a position that Senator Carol Moseley-Braun raised on the Sen-
ate floor, not granting a Federal charter to an organization made
up of many fine people who continue to display the Confederate
flag as a symbol. The charter would have given them the right, the
imprimatur of the Federal Government to do that.
                                              337

  It had nothing to do with the first amendment, Judge, so don't
worry. But the Senator made a very significant speech rivaled only,
in my view, by a private speech given to me personally by a man
whose office I now occupy, Senator John Stennis from Mississippi.

  Judge, I hope some day you are able to come to my office and
see the conference table in my room, which Judge Stennis--he was
a judge--Senator Stennis presented to me as he left the Senate. It
was a table that he referred to as "the flagship of the confederacy,"
where he indicated to me that every Wednesday, I believe it was,
the Senators from the old Confederate States would meet with the
most powerful member of the U.S. Senate, from what I hear, in the
last 40 years, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. They would sit
at this table at lunch, and to quote Senator Stennis, beginning in
the late fifties through the early sixties, plan the demise of the civil
rights legislation in the Senate.

  The first time I came to his office, as a young Senator at age 29,
just having been elected, he asked me why I ran for public office.
And being as impolitic as I am, not stopping to think, I said civil
rights, Mr. Chairman. As soon as I said that, I realized who I was
speaking to, and I remember the beads of perspiration breaking out
on my forehead, and he said, "Remember the first time you came
to me see me."

  And I hadn't, Judge, and he reminded me it was to pay my re-
spect as a young Senator, and he said, "I wanted to tell you then
what I want to tell you now." He said,

  It's appropriate that this table, the flagship of the confederacy, is now yours, for
the Nation has changed, and it is good that it has.

  I got up to leave, and he said to me, "One more thing." He said,
"The civil rights laws in America have done more to free the white
man than the black man."

  I thought that was an astounding statement for a then 84-year-
old man, I believe, who had served in the Senate over 42 years, and
in the minds of young activists or semiactivists, like me in the six-
ties, was one of the symbols of resistance to change.

  You have never been a symbol of resistance to change, but you
have been a symbol of courage, and today was one of those days.
For the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, and me to cast the
vote we did today, it takes no political courage. But for you it did,
and it was moving.

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, if I may just add, I wish you the
best, Judge Ginsburg. I think you are going to bring honor to the
U.S. Supreme Court. I will cast my vote for you with great pride.

  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you so much, Senator Simon.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have attempted to survey my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to see who has additional questions, and I
understand that Senator Brown and Senator Heflin have some ad-
ditional questions, and Senator Specter has some additional ques-
tions. I have a very few, maybe 5 minutes worth.
  I asked the staff now, I put the staff of all the Senators here on
notice that it is my intention to excuse the witness this evening at
whatever time, so that she need not come back and is able to see
a good movie this weekend or whatever she would like to do. So
I would ask you to ask your Senators, if you would, please, in the
                                               338

next 20 minutes or so to let me know if they have a desire to ask
additional questions.

  I understand you have begun this round, Judge, at about 5 after
5. If it is appropriate, I would yield now to Senator Brown, whose
turn it is to ask questions. After his round of questions, depending
on how long they go, you can let me know whether you would like
to break then or we should continue with Senator Heflin and his
questions. But, hopefully, we will get you home at a reasonable
hour, and you will be able to do what I am sure you will, watch
the remainder of the proceedings on television. I am sure you will
be glued to your television. But that is my intention, if that is ap-
propriate, if that is all right with you.

  Judge GlNSBURG. That is the greatest thing I have heard all day.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Ginsburg, I appreciate the long day that you put in. The
only thing I know that is somewhat comparable to this process is
the bar exam. The only difference, of course, is this is oral and that
is written. In this case, many of the people who grade the test have
different answers, so it is more of a challenge.
  The CHAIRMAN. And they are not as informed as you, and I in-
clude myself in that category.
  Senator BROWN. I never thought that was a major impediment
for people who took the bar exam.
  Judge GINSBURG. That was 2 days, at least when I took it, back
in ancient times. The bar exam was 2 days. I don't know what it
is now.
  Senator BROWN. I guess in the older days when I took it, it was
3.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was 3 for me as well, but maybe the Senator
and I were slower.
  Senator BROWN. Our State was less benign. [Laughter.]
  It is really quite an extraordinary treat to have you here. You
not only have a distinguished academic record that we have talked
about, but really a very excellent record in terms as an adjudicator
and as a teacher.
  If I were to describe an area of the law where perhaps you have
as much or more experience than anyone we have had the pleasure
of coming before the committee, it would be on the equal protection
clause. We touched on it in our earlier discussions, and I thought
I would follow up with questions in this area. And I appreciate the
sensitivity with regard to how you would rule, and I would want
to direct this more to the pleadings and your writings in this area.
I say that because I think people should keep in mind that when
you are filing pleadings you are an advocate. That doesn't nec-
essarily mean that it is how you would rule. I think anyone who
reviews your record knows that.
  But with that in mind, as I review the equal protection clause,
I guess my first question is if you feel that that clause suggests,
in effect, a sex-blind standard with regard to legislation and pro-
grams?
                                      339
  Judge GlNSBURG. In most instances, that is correct. "Nor shall
any person be denied the equal protection of the laws." It is my
firm belief that for purposes of being whatever a person wishes and
is able to be, sex is not a relevant criterion.
  One of the things I think is so wonderful about being the second
woman and looking forward to the third and the fourth, is that I
am thought of as judge, who happens to be a woman.
  Recently, I sat on a complex case with Judge Karen Henderson
and my former Chief Judge, Patricia M. Wald. When the three of
us left the courtroom at the conclusion of argument we noticed
there were three women. We sat together for close to 3 hours. And
nobody even remarked on it. That was a tremendous change from
the way it was 10 years ago. We were judges who happened to be
women, but we were judges. So I think for most purposes, sex is
not a relevant criterion for choosing.
  Senator BROWN. I particularly appreciated your comment the
other day or observation that sometimes that which has been in-
cluded in our laws that are defined as favors, sometimes is not that
at all in the long run for women. And we explored that a bit yester-
day. My mother had gone through law school in the 1940's and
worked as an attorney in the 1950's and 1960's, and I know from
firsthand experience with her life that that is a keen observation.
  What I thought I might do is go through questions that occurred
to me, though, as I thought about the application of the equal pro-
tection clause and ask you to help me understand it, help us under-
stand certain instances in which it may or may not apply.
  Nan and I were lucky enough to have twins. They turned out to
be a boy and a girl. In the process of their growing up, we have
run into occasions where the law and the world treats them dif-
ferently. I suppose the first thing that happened was that my son
had the opportunity to register for the draft, which my daughter
did not. Indeed, a provision of the law which may not be extended;
the draft is obviously up before Congress right now. But as it is
structured now, young men register for the draft; young women do
not.
  Is this an example of unequal protection under the laws?
  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Brown, once it was just that way with
jury duty, not that long ago. It wasn't a question that your son had
the opportunity. He had the obligation. And so it was with jury
duty. Men had the obligation, and women, it was thought, had the
opportunity. They could serve if they wanted to. And we may see
someday a similar change in this area.
  It is not unknown in the world that women are obliged to serve
their country as men are. That is something that has been before
Congress, and may be before it again.
  Senator BROWN. About that time also, both got driver's licenses,
and we had the unique pleasure, as I know you have in your fam-
ily, to add a rider to your policy or to secure different auto insur-
ance rates. As it turned out, the auto insurance companies that we
dealt with seemed to think that my son was a significantly greater
risk than my daughter. An observation, incidentally, which appears
to have some basis in fact.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Boys drive more, drink more, and commit more
alcohol-related offenses. That, on average, is certainly true, and the
                                                340

Supreme Court acknowledged it in a case called Craig v. Boren
(1976).

  Senator BROWN. This is obviously not a function so much of our
statutes as a function of our market system with insurance. That
is not to say we don't legislate insurance rates. Sometimes we do.

  Is this an area where the equal protection of the laws may well
require uniform insurance rates?

  Judge GINSBURG. Not unless the Government takes over the
business of insurance. You know that differentials of that same na-
ture work the other way for pensions. Women, on average, live
longer than men. Many women die young; many men live long.
But, on average, it is unquestionably true that women live longer
than men. And so, until not so long ago, when people retired, the
women got less than the men because it was thought that there
was actuarial equality. Women would live longer. Women, on aver-
age, would live longer so, in the end, they would get the same
amount, but it would be stretched out over a longer period of time.

  Lawsuits were brought challenging that differential under title
VII. The hook was not the Constitution because the Constitution
restricts government action, not private action. It was the civil
rights, equal employment opportunity legislation Congress had
passed. Title VII is applicable to the private sector. And it was
often private employers who were providing these plans to their
employees. The private employer is covered by title VII and cannot
discriminate on the basis of sex, not because of the Constitution
but because of the law that Congress passed.

  So in group plans connected with employment, those differentials
are unlawful. They aren't unlawful yet--unless Congress passes a
law so regulating the insurance industry--on an individual basis.
If I want to buy an annuity from a private insurance company,
then, barring some State law, the insurance company can still say
I will get less per month than a man of identical age because, on
average, women live longer than men. But in group plans that is
no longer permissible because of title VII.

  It isn't true for individual plans any more than it is for auto-
mobile insurance, and I know just what you are talking about be-
cause we had the identical experience when my son got his driver's
license. Our premium went way up.

  Senator BROWN. I certainly hope that that differential was not as
justified as it is in some families. [Laughter.]

  Judge GINSBURG. I will remain silent on that subject.
  Senator BROWN. I don't know that there is any bar to incrimina-
tion of your family.
  One of the other areas that comes to mind is the whole question
of affirmative action. You have drawn, I think, a very clear and
succinct differentiation between government programs and the pri-
vate sector with your last response in the application of the con-
stitutional protections for equal protection.
  Affirmative action comes, I guess, as a remedy for areas where
discrimination has been spotted and perhaps well may involve gov-
ernmental standards that restrict discrimination.
  Would the equal protection clause apply to affirmative action
programs?
                                      341
  Judge GINSBURG. The equal protection clause applies to govern-
ment action, and there have been two cases that have come up in
the course of these discussions: one, the Croson(1989) case, involv-
ing city plans, and the other, MetropolitanBroadcasting (1990), in-
volving Federal plans. Government action is restricted; it is con-
trolled by the equal protection guarantee. Private action in the em-
ployment sector is controlled by title VII prohibiting discrimination
on the ground of race, national origin, religion, sex.
  So while the equal protection principle doesn't apply, the title VII
legislation does apply and does control affirmative action programs
in the private sector.
  Senator BROWN. I wanted to cover one last area, and it may be
an area you would prefer not to explore. If you do, I would cer-
tainly understand.
  I believe earlier on Senator Cohen and others had brought up a
question with regard to homosexual rights. I would not expect you
to comment on something that may well involve a case before the
Court in the future. But there is a question I thought you might
clear up for us that I think has some relevance here.
  The equal protection clause, as we have explored it this after-
noon, requires, in effect, sex-blind standards with regard to govern-
ment action or legislation. That relates to classes of people; in this
case, males and females. Obviously, there are other classes.
  In the event we are dealing with forms of behavior--and I appre-
ciate that is not a foregone conclusion with regard to homosexuals.
In other words, it is open to debate whether or not it is a class of
people or forms of behavior. But in the event we are dealing with
forms of behavior, would homosexuals be protected under the provi-
sions of the equal protection clause?
  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Brown, I am so glad you prefaced your
inquiry by saying you would understand if I resisted a response,
because in this area, I sense that anything I say could be taken as
a hint or a forecast of how I would, treat a classification that is
going to be in question before a court, and ultimately the Supreme
Court. So I think it is best that I not say anything that could be
used as a prediction of how I might vote with regard to that classi-
fication.
  Senator BROWN. Judge, thank you for your responses.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. It is a convenient time. There are 6
minutes left for us to go vote. Why don't we break now for 15 min-
utes?
  Judge, I think we are moving along. Senator Specter, I was going
to ask his staff, it might be appropriate to ask him after the vote
if he wishes to question after we come back. I know he has ques-
tions. And I don't think there are any other questions on our side
of the aisle. I have a couple, but I may submit them in writing to
you, on Chevron. But at this moment I am not sure anyone would
understand except you Chevron from Chivron.
  So we now will recess for 15 minutes to go vote, and come back,
and then we will see where the next round takes us. But we are
getting there, Judge.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you. I appreciate that.
  [A short recess was taken.]
                                               342

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN [presiding]. The Judiciary Committee
will reconvene.

  Senator COHEN. It is quite a day for you, isn't it?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Tell me about it.
  I understand that Senators Grassley, Specter, and Cohen have
questions of the nominee.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Madam Chairman, for the benefit of my col-
leagues, I only have questions that probably will take no more than
5 or 6 minutes.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. And I understand--and perhaps I am
wrong about this--that you were going to defer to Senator Specter
to go first?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Not if he will let me go first.
  Senator SPECTER. How can I stop him?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Ginsburg, I would like to discuss some-
thing with you that we probably would have discussed at our ses-
sion tomorrow, but if we discussed it tomorrow, we still probably
would have to discuss it again in open session anyway. So for the
benefit of time, I would like to go ahead with something I have cor-
responded with you about. If I could put you at ease, recent cor-
respondence that you have had with me basically satisfies me, but
I want to go ahead and bring it out for the record, anyway.
  I want to address your membership in the Woodmont Country
Club. This committee has looked at the club membership of nomi-
nees to determine if the club engaged in any discrimination, and
you know about our concern about that on this committee. At least
for the last several years it has been a major concern. It is even
something we debated as recently as our last two executive meet-
ings.
  You belonged to the Woodmont Country Club in Rockville for
several years in the 1980's. You said you resigned after the club
changed its by-laws and you felt it caused Judge Harry Edwards,
the only black member of the club, to resign.
  So I would like to explore not that aspect of it, but another as-
pect of this club membership, and that is the ethical implications
of your membership at Woodmont. When you joined the club, you
did not pay any initiation fee, is that correct?
  Judge GINSBURG. That's correct, Senator. We paid dues, but not
initiation for the period from August 1980 when I joined, until
April 1983, when I resigned.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Then you have answered another ques-
tion I was going to ask, and that was whether or not you paid dues
or fees.
  The next point is, do you know the amount of initiation fee that
was paid by incoming members at that particular time?
  Judge GINSBURG. NO, but I do know what the dues were at the
time that I resigned, I mean the initiation. The initiation at the
time I resigned, which Judge Harry Edwards and I were asked to
pay, I believe was $25,000.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I thank you for that very certain answer.
There were press reports to the effect that it was somewhere be-
tween $20,000 and $25,000. It is my understanding today's initi-
                                                343

ation fees would be about $65,000. You could buy a good Iowa farm
for that.

  Anyway, moving on, the ABA Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits
the acceptance of gifts, bequests, favor or loan, except in limited
circumstances. Canon 4 requires that if a gift or favor meets one
of the exemptions and is accepted, and it must be reported like
compensation, if its value exceeds $150. And at the time you joined,
it is my understanding that that was $100.

  In addition, the Code of Judicial Conduct of the Judicial Con-
ference contains a similar provision in canon 5. I know that you did
not consider the waiver of the initiation fee to be a gift, because
you only accepted special membership or at least a membership
that was classified as special, as opposed to the regular. As you ex-
plained in your written response to me, that category of member-
ship did not entitle you to voting privileges. In addition, you could
not pass on your membership to your children.

  Other than these two distinctions, were there any other restric-
tions to your special membership?

  Judge GlNSBURG. It was terminable at will, as I understand it.
My membership was a membership category that was terminable
by the club at any time.

  Senator GRASSLEY. SO that was an additional restriction.
  Judge GlNSBURG. Those three, as I understand it: no right to
vote; no right to obtain any membership for my children; and the
membership was terminable by the club at any time.
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU did have a good reason for resigning, but
if there had not been that reason for resigning, and considering the
fact that you could expect to be on the Court for life, you could
have had membership in the club for the rest of your life, as long
as you were still a sitting judge, presumably?
  Judge GlNSBURG. The membership was terminable by the club at
any time, as it in fact was. We were not given notice. We didn't
know in advance, because we weren't voting members. Both Judge
Edwards and I were informed that our special membership would
be terminated, and that is what led to my resignation.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I don't argue with that and I am only trying
to make the point that, at the time you had it and until they noti-
fied you that you would have to pay an initiation fee to stay in,
that special membership could have been, by the waiving of the ini-
tiation fee, could have been good for the rest of your life.
  Judge GlNSBURG. It could have been for the term of my Govern-
ment service.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes. I think I will go on.
  You had full use of club facilities, but a waiver of initiation fees.
At the time you received this benefit, you did not consider it a gift
or favor. But in a letter you wrote to me dated July 21, and which
I received today, you indicated that you should have regarded this
as a gift and disclosed it, as required under the code of conduct.
I am glad to hear that you acknowledge that the waiver of the ini-
tiation fee should have been reported.
  I would like to have that letter placed in the record, Madam
Chairman.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Without objection.

                             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
                                   WASHINGTON. DC 2OOO1

                                           July 21, 199"3

The Honorable Charles E. Grassley
 135 Senate Hart Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Grassley:

          In my July 16 response to your question, did I regard
Woodmont Country Club's special government membership category --
 in which I participated from August 1980 to April 1983 -- as
conveying a gift to me, I said no. My responses to your question
pointed out that regular membership, which required the payment
of initiation fee as well as annual dues, was voting and
permanent and carried with it the significant right to obtain
memberships for the member's children. Special membership
required payment of dues but not the payment of initiation fee; a
special membership was terminable by the Club at any time,
terminating automatically when government service ended, and
included no right to vote or to obtain any membership for
children of the special member.

          I did not regard special membership as a gift from Woodmont,
because the lower cost of special membership, embodied in the
absence of an initiation fee, reflected the lower level of
privileges and rights that inhered in the special membership
class.

          Nonetheless, following preparation of my response to your
questions, I inquired through the White House counsel's office of
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerning
applicable Judicial Branch regulation, if any, of a judge's
acceptance of a social club special membership. In a response
from the Administrative Office General Counsel I have learned
these things.

         First, neither of the primary sources of such regulation --
the regulations of the Judicial Conference concerning gifts made
under Title III of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 as
amended, and the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, as
adopted by the Judicial Conference -- expressly addresses the
question at hand.

         Second, in 1975 in Advisory Opinion No. 47 the Judicial
Conference Advisory Committee considered a factual variant of the
question at hand. The 1975 case asked the propriety of a judge's
accepting a complimentary country club membership under which the
judge would not be required to pay either dues or an initiation
fee. Assuming, as was also true of Woodmont, that the club would
not likely be a litigant in the federal court and that the
special membership was not proffered to exploit the judge's
position, the Committee concluded:

         - The judge's receipt of the membership was permitted under
Canon 5C(4)(c).
                                  346

          - The value of the membership, if in excess of $100, should
be reported as a permitted gift on the judge's financial
disclosure form.

         My 1980-83 special membership in Woodmont is different from
the situation in Advisory Opinion No. 47, in that the initiation
fee was waived and annual dues were not. Despite that
distinction, however, I believe it would be reasonable to
conclude that the Woodmont membership should be reported as a
gift under Advisory Opinion Ho. 47 because the money value of the
initiation fee waiver exceeded $100.

         Accordingly, applying the conclusions of Advisory Opinion
No. 47, I now believe that prior to 1984 I should have disclosed,
on my annual financial disclosure form, as a permitted gift the
special membership I held in Woodmont County Club during the
period August 1980 to April 1983.

         I sincerely regret that I was not in the period 1980-83, and
indeed until now, aware of the conclusion embodied in Advisory
Opinion No. 47.

                                               Sincerely,

                                               Ruth Bader Ginsburg

                    RESPONSES OF JUDGE RUTH BADER GINSBURG
                             TO JULY 16,1993 QUESTIONS FROM

                           THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                            CONCERNING HER MEMBERSHIP IN

                                 WOODMONT COUNTRY CLUB

  l(a). When did you join Woodmont Country Club?

          I joined Woodmont Country Club in or about August 1980.

  l(b). Did you pay an initiation fee upon joining the Club?

          No.

  1 (c). Was the fee you paid the standard fee paid by other individuals joining the Club?

          As explained more fully below in the answer to question 3(b), I was a member of
          Woodmont in a special membership category. Initiation fee was not charged to
          special members. Individuals joining Woodmont as regular members did pay an
          initiation fee.

  2(a) Did you pay monthly dues and fees during the time you held membership at
          Woodmont Country Club?
                                      347

         Yes.

2(b). Were the dues and fees you paid the standard rates paid by other Club members?

         I believe so, but I am not certain. See my answer to question 3(b).

3(a). If any answer to l(b), (c), 2(a), (b) above is no, did you regard your membership at
         Woodmont Country Club as a gift'

         No.

3(b). If not, why not?

         Woodmont Country Club, in common I understand with other clubs in the
         Washington metropolitan area, for many years has maintained a special
         membership category open to Senators, Representatives, higher officers in the
         Executive branch, and, prior to a 1983 change in Woodmont's by-laws (described
         below in the answer to question 4(a)), federal judges. Special members do not pay
         initiation fee, but do pay annual dues and fees. To the best of my knowledge, dues
         and fees charged special members and regular members were the same.

         At Woodmont the privileges of regular membership and the privileges of special
         membership differed. Regular membership was tenured; provided he or she
         continued to pay annual dues, a regular member maintained membership in
         Woodmont for life. The child of a regular member, upon becoming an adult, was
         permitted to become a regular member of Woodmont in addition to and ultimately
         m replacement of the parent member.

         At Woodmont a special membership was temporary. Special membership was tied
         to continued government service; termination of government service automatically
         terminated membership in the Club. In addition, the Board of Governors could
         terminate a special member at any time. Special members did not vote. The child
         of a special member, upon becoming an adult, did not become a member of
         Woodmont either in addition to or in substitution for the parent special member,
         and instead lost the privilege of using the Club facilities.

         The lower cost of special membership, embodied in the absence of an initiation
         fee, reflected the lower level of privileges and rights that inhered in the special
         membership class. A regular member, paying initiation fee, was assured
         permanence of membership and the right to pass membership on to children. A
         special member, not charged initiation fee, was not able to pass membership on to
         children, lost membership upon termination of government service, and could at
         any time be terminated as a special member by action of the Board of Governors.

4(a). Please explain in detail the change in Woodmont Country Club by-laws which
         caused your resignation from the Club.

         When I joined Woodmont Country Club in August 1980 as a special member, that
         category of governmental membership, I was informed, had existed for a great
         many years and throughout that period had encompassed federal judges as well as
         other government officials above a certain level on the protocol list. At the time I
         joined Woodmont, I was told, there were a number of special members from
         Congress and the Executive, but, while other federal judges had been special
         members in the past, I was currently the only federal judge special member. In
                                       348

         March 1982 Judge Harry Edwards, a D C . Circuit colleague and friend, joined
         Woodmont as a special member. Judge Edwards is black.

         In November 1982 Woodmont circulated to the regular members a set of proposed
         changes in the by-laws of the Club. Among the proposed changes was a revision
         in the special membership category that would, among other things, eliminate
         federal judges as special members. Proposed by-law changes were not circulated
         to special members, because they did not vote, and thus Judge Edwards and I,
         although we were the only two members of Woodmont directly affected by the
         proposal, received no notification of it in November 1982.

         In March 1983 I received a letter from Woodmont for the first time informing me
         that a change in the by-laws had been adopted under which federal judges were no
         longer eligible to be special members. The letter told me mat I could remain in the
         Club until the end of 1984 at which time either my membership would terminate
         or, upon payment of initiation fee, I could opt to become a regular member. The
         letter also informed me that, to facilitate that choice, I would be given priority on
         the waiting list for regular membership in the Club. I correctly assumed that an
         identical letter was simultaneously sent to Judge Edwards.

         This change in the by-laws, in my view, had the practical effect of strongly
         discouraging Judge Edwards from continuing his membership beyond 1984, and in
         fact upon receiving the Club's letter Judge Edwards promptly resigned. I can not
         with certainty say that prompting that resignation was the purpose of the by-law
         change, but the circumstances were, to me, suggestive of that conclusion.

         Immediately upon receiving the letter notifying me of the by-law change, I
         attempted to initiate a reversal of that action. My spouse, who was our family's
         active user of the Club facilities, met the following day with members of
         Woodmont's Board of Governors. The Board, however, was unwilling to reverse
         the by-law change and, although the president of Woodmont did confer with Judge
         Edwards in an effort to retain him as a member, that effort did not succeed.

         No longer comfortable at Woodmont, like Judge Edwards I promptly resigned my
         membership.

4(b) How did mis change affect you and your judicial colleague who also resigned at
         the same time you did?

         See my answer to question 4(a).

5(a) When did the by-law change become effective?

         As explained in my answer to question 4(a), the revised by-laws were adopted
         sometime after November 1982 and before April 1983. I do not know the exact
         date because I received no notification of the proposed change until after the
         change had been adopted. Also as explained in my answer to question 4(a), I was
         informed that I could retain special membership in Woodmont until the end of
         1984. I did not elect to do so.

5(b) When did your resignation become effective?

         I do not recall the exact date, but I believe it was in early April 1983, although it
         may have been on a date toward the end of March 1983.
                                      349
  Senator GRASSLEY. The rule against accepting gifts and favors,
I believe, is designed to ensure the impartiality of judges. In fact,
the canon that covers gifts states that judges are prohibited from
accepting gifts or favors where the donor is a party to a case or
other persons who has come or is likely to come or whose interests
have come or likely to come before a judge.
  Did you give any consideration, in accepting the waiver of the
initiation fee, to the possibility of other Woodmont members or
their interests would come before you, as a judge, and did you have
a recusal policy with respect to the country club?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I did not think that the membership in that
golf club would present a conflict. But, of course, if any affair in-
volving the Woodmont Country Club had come before my court, I
would have recused myself. I was hardly the first member of my
court to be a special member of that club. A long-time Chief Judge
of my court, Judge Bazelon, had been a member, and a few of the
district judges, I believe, had been members. But at the time of my
membership, the only other Federal judge in the club was Judge
Edwards. He took up golfing and came, particularly with my hus-
band, to play at Woodmont; he liked it, and therefore joined the
club. At the time of my resignation, only Judge Edwards and I
were members of Woodmont, but earlier Judge Bazelon and a cou-
ple of district judges held memberships.
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU may not even be in a position to answer
this, I recognize that, and I wouldn't have thought of it, except for
the statement you just made. Because of colleagues' membership in
the same club, do you know of any recusal by any member because
of potential conflict?
  Judge GlNSBURG. I don't recall any matter having to do with
Woodmont Country Club during my tenure on the court having
come before the court.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge, I am satisfied with your answer. From
my perspective, this oversight is not necessarily a disqualifier. As
I said when the media one time asked me about Clarence Thomas
trying marijuana, my answer was that we weren't confirming him
for sainthood, we were confirming him for the Supreme Court. We
are all human and all fallible, and I am satisfied that we have had
an opportunity to discuss this.
  I thank you and I yield the floor.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. At this time, I have questions as a
member of the committee, but I don't know if it is appropriate. Sen-
ator Specter had indicated that he wanted to
  Senator HATCH. It is entirely appropriate for you to go ahead,
and then we will go to Senator Specter after. How is that?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I didn't know whether or not you had
a reason for wanting to leave now.
  Senator SPECTER. I would be glad to wait my turn, Madam
Chairman.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Fine. Thank you very much, Senator
Specter. That is very nice of you.
  Judge I would like to talk about the first amendment a little bit,
particularly in the area of violence or having to do with violence.
Obscene expression is considered by the Court to be unprotected
speech, that is longstanding law, and it may, therefore, be prohib-
                                               350

ited. Expression which is sexually explicit may be indecent, but not
obscene, and, therefore, under the rule in FCC v. Pacifica Founda-
tion and other cases, that speech may be regulated, but not prohib-
ited.

  Indeed, you wrote an opinion in the case of Action for Children's
Televisiony. FCC, which involved an attempt by the FCC to regu-
late material which was indecent, but not obscene, and which was
having to do with the protection, the notion being that the children
should be protected in terms of the hours that such material might
be viewed.

  There are many, including this Senator, who believe that vio-
lence in our media, in the television and the movies, has had a pro-
found effect on our society, and particularly on our young people.
Indeed, in a hearing here regarding Senator Simon's initiative in
this area, one cf the witnesses testified that it is no longer debat-
able, but that the depiction of violence does have the effect of in-
creasing young people's proclivity to violence.

  In your decision in Action for Children's Television v. FCC, you
have upheld, in part, the FCC's attempt to regulate obscene mate-
rial, and so my question to you is: One, do you think that violence
may be categorized as indecent material in the first instance? And
what standards do you think ought to be applied to violence as
speech? The threshold question is do you see violence as an expres-
sion which would rise to the level of being speech? Then, second,
do you think that it, therefore, can be categorized as indecent, if
not in extreme cases obscene speech, and then, if so, what stand-
ards do you think ought to be applied to violence as speech in the
media?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator, I can begin with that question. You
referred to Action for Children's Television (1988), which is still in
the courts. My opinion at a prior stage of the litigation differen-
tiates between regulating in the interest of children, which my
court said was entirely lawful, and overregulating to the extent
that adults have no access.

  We know that regulations permissible for the broadcast media
are impermissible for the print media. The question of violence is
one that may well come up, and I don't want to deal in the speech
area with a category that the FCC, under Congress' direction or on
its own initiative, may decide to regulate. Then it will come before
the Court, just as the indecent speech question came before the
Court, so I don't want to be seen as prejudging it.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Without looking at just regulatory ac-
tion in this area, if challenged on constitutional grounds as obscene
or indecent, would you be inclined to see extreme violence, gratu-
itous violence as unprotected speech, or as speech which might be
amenable to regulation?

  Judge GlNSBURG. Speech that is obscene is outside the first
amendment. Speech that is indecent is inside, but subject to regu-
lation. Where this would fit has not come up yet, where this cat-
egory of speech would belong I can't say at this time.

  I can say to you, as a parent, that I am as concerned, perhaps
more concerned about the exposure of children to violence, and I
have had some experience with a controlled system, as my daugh-
ter will confirm. When she was with me in Sweden, violent films
                                      351
were off-limits to children. Children were not permitted to attend
such films, and it was the first time it had occurred to me that a
State reasonably might regulate in that area. But I can tell you
that this has not yet occurred. It may very well occur. It would cer-
tainly be subject to challenge on first amendment grounds, and so
I don't want to express any legal opinion on it.

  But if I may, after we had our conversation yesterday, I was un-
comfortable with an answer I gave you. When I went back to the
courthouse, I read the Presley v. Etowah County Commission (1992)
case, and can tell you a little more than I did earlier. The Court's
opinion focused solely on section 5. But the Court said nothing in
the opinion that implies the conduct at issue in these cases is not
actionable under a different remedial scheme. The Etowah County
case, as I understand it, is back in the lower court for consideration
of other claims made. These include title VI of the Civil Rights Act
and the constitutional claim of deliberate discrimination in remov-
ing the functions of individual commissioners when the first black
commissioner was elected.

  So the case is still alive in Court. It is still possible that there
may be a further ruling. But what the Court said under section 5
is not the end of the road for that particular case.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I appreciate that followup. I guess my
concern in Presley really was a matter of your view of the language
of the statute, the specific language of section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act, and, given the facts of that case, whether or not the
Court gave too narrow an interpretation of the language in such a
way that essentially frustrated the meaning of the statute as a
whole.

  Judge GINSBURG. I avoided commenting on Supreme Court deci-
sions when other Senators raised that question, so I must adhere
to that position.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Then another softball in the first
amendment area. The Senate has been dealing fairly extensively,
in fact, just recently passed legislation in the area of campaign fi-
nance regulation. As you are aware, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Court
considered the constitutionality of the act of 1971 and upheld con-
tribution limits, disclosure and reporting provisions of the public fi-
nancing scheme, but invalidated the limitation of expenditures. In
short, the Court took the view that contributions could be limited,
because contributions are only a means of expressing one's views,
but that expenditures could not be limited, because to limit expend-
itures would effectively limit the total quantity of an individual or
a candidate's speech.

  In an important passage, the Court declared in Buckley that "it
is wholly foreign to the first amendment for government to restrict
the speech of some elements of our society, in order to enhance the
relative voice of others." In other words, although the Government
can attempt to improve the marketplace of ideas in a variety of
ways, including contribution limitations, it cannot constitutionally
attempt to improve public debate by silencing those who already
have too much speech.

  Implementing that proposition, the Court, in First National Bank
of Boston v. Bellotte, invalidated a Massachusetts statute prohibit-
ing corporations from making contributions.
                                      352

  Following the decision in that case, Justice White wrote a scath-
ing dissent, in which he said it is critical to obviate or dispel the
impression that Federal elections are purely and simply a function
of money, that Federal officers are bought and sold, or that political
races are reserved for those who have the facility or the stomach
for doing whatever it takes to bring together those interest groups
and individuals that can raise or contribute large fortunes, in order
to prevail at the polls.

  My question to you, Judge Ginsburg is, Do you believe with Jus-
tice White that the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley case
was an example of judicial activism into an area that Congress it-
self should have ruled on?

  Judge GINSBURG. That falls in the same category as the prior
question. You are inviting comment on Supreme Court opinions, or
separate opinions, in an area live with business. We get Federal
election campaign business regularly in the District of Columbia
Circuit. The Supreme Court gets some of that business. So this is
a vibrant area for challenge.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. All right. Well, to move along, if I un-
derstand you to say you can't answer that question. You might say
that I couldn't possibly comment, as they might say.

  In Red Lion v. FCC, the Court, as you know, rejected an attack
by a Pennsylvania radio station on the fairness doctrine--And I
don't know. Have these questions been asked already? I was on the
floor a little while this afternoon. OK. Thank you--which required
radio broadcasters to permit people attacked on the air the oppor-
tunity to reply.

  The station was resisting an FCC order to give free time to an
author who had been accused of Communist activities on the air.
NBC and CBS joined the station, arguing, as Justice White put it,
that the first amendment secured the station's right to "broadcast
whatever they chose and to exclude whomever they chose."

  Justice White, in writing for a unanimous Court, said, "There is
no sanctuary in the first amendment for unlimited private censor-
ship operating in a medium not open to all." It was not simply that
Government had granted the radio station its FCC license. The
point was that the first amendment protected the public's right to
nave a dialog, not the corporation's right to censor that dialog.

  Again, to quote Justice White,

  The right of free speech of a broadcaster, the use of a sound truck, or any other
individual does not embrace the right to snuff out the free speech of others.

  And so I guess my question in this area goes to the extent to
which you see a role for the Court in the absence of--we have de-
veloped standards in regards to obscenity. We have developed
standards with regard to sexually explicit speech on the one hand.
But in areas going to other forms, other important forms of speech,
such as violence, such as campaign expenditures and the use of the
media, the air waves to communicate in this area, the Court has
been less clear.

  Just as a broad, general question, do you see a need for the de-
velopment of standards that will give us some guidelines as to an
approach to those issues going to speech which are, frankly, non-
traditional? When the early first amendment cases came down, we
didn't have to worry about satellite transmission of campaign com-
                                               353

mercials, but now we do. And we have the specter of violence again
that we have never had before. And so I suppose my question to
you, Judge Ginsburg, is: Do you see a need for some clarity there?
Because, after all, that is supposed to be the role, to have some cer-
tainty, some clarity in the areas of conduct that is permissible
under our Constitution? Do you see some need for clarity in those
areas?

  Judge GINSBURG. YOU brought up the Red Lion (1969) case,
which indicates one line that has been drawn. There is no right to
reply to a newspaper comment. There is no fairness doctrine appli-
cable there. Tornillo (1974) is the rule. The different regime for the
broadcast media was once explained on the basis of the scarcity of
the spectrum. That is a less tenable ground for distinction today.
The fairness doctrine is up for consideration again. The must carry
rules are alive and are in litigation. Again, I can refer to the dis-
tinction drawn between the print media and the broadcast media.
But beyond that, I can't comment on the fairness doctrine or the
"must carry" rules, the differential regulation of the broadcast
media. You said it so well, and in a lot fewer words that I have
been using. I can't go further at this point.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Judge Ginsburg, thank you very much.
I would have loved to have taken a class with you.

  Judge GINSBURG. YOU are so kind, and I know it has been a very
busy, important day for you.

  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.
  I will try to be relatively brief, Judge Ginsburg. It has been a
long day. But there are a number of other subjects that I would
like to touch on with you.
  At the conclusion of our last round, you made reference to an ex-
change of correspondence that you and I had had when I wrote to
you about a comment in your article on confirming Supreme Court
Justices, thoughts on a second opinion rendered by the Senate. And
referring to Judge Bork, you had stated, 'The distinction between
judicial philosophy and votes in particular cases having blurred as
the questions wore on." And I then asked you to provide me with
examples of such questions to Judge Bork in order to help us in
the course of your hearing. And I just wanted to make for the
record my letter to you dated July 15 and your reply to me dated
July 16 and my reply to that dated July 19 a part of the record.

Washington, D.C. 20001

Dear Judge Ginsburg:

         Thanks again for your offer to meet with me; and,
as you know, I would like to do that before the
hearings are concluded.

         In the meantime T do have one question which I
would appreciate your answering before the hearing.

         I have just read the article in the University of
Illinois Law Review entitled "Confirming Supreme Court
Justices: Thoughts on the Second Opinion Rendered by
the Senate."

         In that article you said, as I read it, that thorn
should be a difference before Judge Bork's answers and
responses from Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice
Kennedy. Referring to Judge nork at page 114 you
state:

         "The distinction between judicial philosophy
        and votes in particular cases having blurred
        as the questions wore on."

I would appreciate your providing me with examples of
such questions to Judge Bork. I would be most
interested in any such questions, as you see it, which
were asked by me.

         I hope this request is not unduly burdensome; but
it would obviously be helpful to me in preparing
questions for the hearings to have your specific views
on which questions, you think, went too far with Judge
Bork.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.

                                                                SJ/icorely(

The Honorable Arlen Specter
Senate Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
Washington, D.c. 20510

Dear Senator Specter:

          Thank you for your letter of July 15, and ror your kindnuso
 in offering to meet with me soon so that we may become better
acquainted.

          Your letter refers to my article "Confirming Supreme Court
Justices: Thoughts on the Second opinion Rendered by the
Senate," published in 1988 in the Illinois Law Review. You
nailed my attention, specifically, to a sentence on page 144.
The sentence comments that, although Judge Bork explained at tho
outset of his hearings that he would not say how he would vote in
any particular case, "'[tjtie distinction between judicial
philosophy and votes in particular cases . . . blurred as the
questions and answers wore on." You asked me to provide you with
specific examples of such "questions to Judge Bork," and
particularly such questions asked by you.

          The sentence you cite was not designed to criticize the
Senate for asking questions that blurred the line between general
 judicial philosophy and particular cases. Rather,rayaim was to
indicate, in the context of Judge Bork's stated intention to draw
a line between the two, that in tho course of his hearings it
became increasingly difficult for him to do so. (I am just now,
as you will appreciate, all the more sensitive to both the need
to, and the difficulty of, adhering to the distinction.)

          It has been five years since the Illinois article was
published and I have long since discarded my notes for the
article. At this distance in time, I am unable to cite
particular exchanges in point. However, i can represent with
assurance that my concern focused on instances in which Judge
Bork, confronting a question of constitutional interpretation or
judicial philosophy, descended the slope and answered in more
detail than he first declared he would. As you know, the purpose
of my article was to examine the historical antecedents to the
modern problems facing the Committee and the nominees who come
before it, not to suggest that the Senate or the Committee had
overstepped its bounds in questioning.

         I hope this brief explanation orthe sentence at page 144
will suffice, at least for now. If you wish, I will be glad to
review the traneorlpt of Judge Bork'n hearings anew and mipply a
more detailed response, onca next week's hearing oonoludcs.

         Ploaae call If there la anything further you would likeno
to supply before July 20.

U. S. Court of Appeals
Washington, D.C. 20001

Dear Judge Ginsburg:

         Thanks very much for your letter of July 16, 199 3.

         I appreciate your assurance that you were not
criticizing Senators for any questions asked during
Judge Bork's hearings.

        While I would be interested academically in your
response after your hearings are concluded, that would
obviously not be helpful in determining the appropriate
range of questions to you during your hearings.

         Perhaps you could supply a few examples -- even
two or three would be helpful. If not, I understand.

  Senator SPECTER. We are working through the whole process as
to appropriate lines of questions. I have already expressed my own
respectful disagreement with the limited answers that you have
provided, and you had offered to give examples as to Judge Bork
after the hearings were over. If you have the time to do so, I think
it would be of interest, although obviously it could not be of assist-
ance in the formulation of questions to you during these hearings.

  A couple of substantive areas that I want to cover with you: The
area of hate speech is one which is on the horizon, and whether
it will come before the Court, I don't know. The Supreme Court in
a very important decision, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, upheld enhanced
sentencing because the defendant had picked out the victim based
on race. And that case, while not based on speech because it in-
volved conduct, has some bearing on the whole subject of hate
speech.

  I have personally always felt that Justice Holmes' dissenting
opinion that the marketplace of ideas requires the broadest range
of speech was very, very important, but have since had some sec-
ond thoughts in line with the hate speech which is coming out. I
was personally a victim going to college, having a swastika outside
of the Pi Lam House at the University of Oklahoma many years
ago. The discriminated-against groups, the victims of the hate, are
now making a pretty strong case that it is not a matter of being
offensive speech, that it is a matter of being injurious speech that
actually interferes with their ability to work, their livelihood, and
their enjoyment of liberty.

  They are raising a concept in rather novel terms of a liberty in-
terest under the Constitution that ought to be balanced off against
freedom of speech. I find it both intriguing and meritorious and
wonder if you would have a comment as to how you would ap-
proach philosophically, judicial ideology, a balancing of interests in
this complex emerging area.

  Judge GlNSBURG. Senator Specter, may I say I appreciate your
indulgence. I would like to comment on the first question. In re-
sponse to a question by another Senator, I tried to explain the sen-
tence to which you referred: "The distinction between judicial phi-
losophy and votes in particular cases blurred as the questions and
answers wore on." I apologize for any ambiguity in that sentence.
I meant to refer to the answers. I said that had come home to me
all the more in these last few days. I am appreciating, in a way
that I never could in the closeness of my chambers, how easy it is
to slip down the slope from speaking on a lofty philosophical plane
to addressing specific cases. I meant to imply no criticism of the
committee. I meant to say how difficult it is for the responder to
adhere to that line.

  The question you just raised is one very much alive on colleges
across the country, and university administrators are struggling
with it. As you know, there are hate-speech codes on a number of
campuses. Faculties try hard to teach students that in an academic
setting there should be free but civil discourse. On the other hand,
there is harassment of individuals. There has been an attempt to
distinguish between speech on the corner of a campus, speech on
a campus mall, that anyone who doesn't want to hear it can avoid,
                                      358
and following an individual and harassing that individual. Those
kinds of distinctions have been attempted in these codes.

  They have come before courts. A case in Michigan is one exam-
ple. I think it is almost certain that these questions are going to
come before the Federal courts and ultimately the Supreme Court.

  I understand the competing tugs. I understand the importance of
the free speech value. And I understand the difficulty university
administrators have in trying both to be tolerant of speech and to
deal with youngsters who, for the first time, are free from their
parents' control. They are in an atmosphere in which they some-
times behave very badly with little or no regard for the feelings of
their fellow students.

  I appreciate the tremendous difficulties in this area, the effort to
teach tolerance and the value of reasoning together. The line be-
tween speech and harassing an individual is not an easy one to
draw and apply. That matter is likely to come before the Court,
and all I can do is repeat what you have already stated. There are
competing considerations. We are a society that has given, beyond
any other, maximum tolerance for the speech that we hate; on the
other hand, we have a deep concern for the equality and dignity
of individuals. Those two principles collide in this area.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Ginsburg, do you think that there
is a liberty interest or an equality interest under the Constitution
to be balanced off--I am not asking how you would decide it--to
be balanced off on one side against freedom of speech on the other?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, I have said that there is a free
speech value on one side. There is the equal dignity of the individ-
ual on the other side. I cannot say more on that subject except this
is an area where two values are in tension. How they will be re-
solved in any given case will depend on the facts of that particular
case.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you articulated in terms of an equal dig-
nity interest, which is a little different than a liberty interest or
an equality interest. But do you see an equal dignity interest rising
to constitutional proportion?

  Judge GINSBURG. The arguments are being made, Senator Spec-
ter, as you well know, in constitutional terms, and they are being
made on both grounds. They are being made in terms of the com-
munity, the group that is being assaulted, and also in terms of the
individual, who is being denigrated or harassed because of the indi-
vidual's membership in that particular group.

  This is a very trying issue for our time: the individual's right to
be free and the individual's respect for others. One hopes that we
can reason together and get the message of mutual respect across
to our young people so that there will not be the kind of clashes
that we have seen.

  But our country has gone through this periodically. I remember
in the late 1960's--what was that movement called? It was particu-
larly big in California. The free speech movement, was it not? I re-
member teaching in New Jersey in the late 1960's when there was
turmoil all over, and I vividly recall a class I was teaching, a proce-
dure class. A student sat in a tree outside the classroom thumbing
his nose at me throughout the class. I had to face the question,
                                      359
should I call the police to take him away, or should I try to ignore
him?

  In 1965 or 1966, Earl Warren came to Newark, NJ, to attend the
dedication of our law school building. People paraded around the
block in various costumes to mimic cases he had decided. The po-
lice asked him, should we remove these people because they are
causing a disturbance? And he said, "No, let them demonstrate. Let
them exercise their free speech rights."

  I can recall on that campus, again in the late 1960's, when uni-
versities contended with both racial turmoil and the free speech
movement, that some minority students charged genocide against
the Jews for their treatment of the Palestinians. I placed on a bul-
letin board, side by side with their charge, an explanation of the
U.N. Genocide Convention and how it had come about, how it had
emerged from the Holocaust. And I watched as some students,
looking at what I posted, said, "We really got a rise out of that Jew,
didn't we?" That was their response to my attempt to be reason-
able, to reason with them about the Genocide Convention.

  So I know how difficult these situations are to resolve. I know
how much, as an individual with emotions, I would want to call in
the police and say, this person is doing an injury to me, to my feel-
ings. But I never did, Senator Specter, because I know, too, the les-
son Holmes tried to teach about maximum freedom for the speech
we hate.

  I can tell you those personal experiences, and say that what we
are witnessing is not something new. What we are seeing on our
college campuses now, altogether we have seen before. And some-
how we came through that period of the late 1960's. We went back
to the relative calm and peace of the universities we knew before
then and will know again. And that is about what I can say on this
subject.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, you responded to a question
by Senator Kennedy quoting your opposition to discrimination
against gays, saying that you were against discrimination as to all
people. And I don't know to what extent you will comment about
this based on the answers you have given so far, but I want to ask
the question.

  In considering the discrimination in our society to a variety of
categories of individuals--disabled, gays, mentally ill--to what ex-
tent do you think it appropriate for the Court to use the standard
which you articulated as an advocate in favor of women's rights
under the equal protection clause, looking to the rights of various
groups discriminated against as I have particularized them? Would
you think it appropriate for the Court to employ in general terms
the boldly dynamic interpretation, radically departing from the
original understanding of the 14th amendment, which you wrote
about in the Washington University Law Quarterly as interpreta-
tion as to women's rights?

  Judge GINSBURG. I have no comment on that, Senator Specter.
I have said that these issues will be coming before the Court. I will
not say anything in this legislative Chamber that will hint or fore-
cast how I will vote in cases involving those particular classifica-
tions.
                                                360

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Ginsburg, again as to rights for women,
you have urged the strict scrutiny standard for equal protection. Do
you think that strict scrutiny is any less applicable to the free exer-
cise clause of the first amendment, free exercise of religious free-
dom under the first amendment?

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, I will address questions that
come to me in the context of a specific case, on the basis of the
facts of that specific case, on the record that is presented in that
case, on the arguments the lawyers make, and on the applicable
law and precedent, but I will not address an abstract issue. Issues
do not come before judges in that form.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I ask it as a matter of judicial philosophy
or judicial ideology, but let me move on.

  On the establishment clause, the dictum of Jefferson has been
quoted repeatedly and it does not go to the heart of the Lemon test
or the divergence over establishment, but I would be interested, if
you would care to respond, to whether you agree with the Jefferson
doctrine that the clause against establishment of religion was in-
tended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.

  Judge GINSBURG. Senator Specter, the first amendment prohibits
the establishment of religion and protects the free exercise thereof.
How the line is drawn between those two safeguards will depend
upon the facts of the specific case. I am not going to expound on
the matter at large and answer an abstract question. I have said
what I feel comfortable saying on that subject.

  Senator SPECTER. The final question I have, Judge Ginsburg, re-
lates to the habeas corpus, which is the Federal procedure for con-
sidering State cases, and there has been some reference and you
have been asked about this to some extent, and it creates enormous
delays on the carrying out of the death penalty as a deterrent, and
I just want to call one case to your attention. Based on the re-
sponses you have given, I anticipate an unwillingness to answer
here, but I want to raise the issue.

  It is a case which came out of Philadelphia captioned Castile v.
Peoples, and there was challenge under habeas corpus to the con-
stitutionality of the conviction, and the district court said that the
defendant had not exhausted his State remedies, the Third Circuit
reversed and said the defendant had exhausted his State rem-
edies--this is somewhat technical for some who may be listening,
but I know this is something that is before the courts consist-
ently--and then the Supreme Court of the United States reversed
the Third Circuit, saying that the defendant had not exhausted his
State remedies, because when it got to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court they turned down what is called a petition for allocatur or
on discretionary grounds. The Supreme Court held that that discre-
tionary turndown may or may not have been considered by the
State court, and then they sent it right back down for reconsider-
ation.

  It is the kind of a case which perplexes law enforcement officers
and legislators. Rather than ask you a question about it, let me
just conclude by saying that I hope that, if confirmed, there would
be more of an effort by the Court to try to deal with these issues,
with as minimal procedural entanglements as possible. If you
would care to comment, I would be pleased, but it is your choice.
                                      361
  Judge GlNSBURG. The only comment that I have, Senator Spec-
ter, is that I appreciate the difficulty that State and Federal courts
alike have had in this area. I have explained that in the District
of Columbia Circuit, we do not have such cases. We do not engage
in habeas review over State court decisions. Our counterpart to
State courts, our District of Columbia courts, have their own
postconviction remedy identical to 28 U.S.C. 2255, and applications
for review go from there to the Supreme Court, with no collateral
review, no collateral attack in the Federal courts.
  So, if confirmed, this will be new business for me. I know it is
very difficult business for State and Federal courts in the regional
circuits across the country, but I will come to it, if confirmed, new.
It is not business I have had, as my colleagues on other Federal
courts have had.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Ginsburg. I end
with a compliment, as I began, on your academic, professional, and
judicial career. I compliment you on your stamina.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  Senator HATCH. Senator Cohen, do you have any questions?
  Senator COHEN. One brief one.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator Cohen.
  Senator COHEN. I am told we are going to start voting in about
5 minutes, and I just have one question I think perhaps you can
clarify for me, Judge Ginsburg.
  Earlier today, Senator Specter asked the question about the reso-
lution of war powers. Whenever you have a conflict between the ex-
ecutive branch and the legislative branch, the Court is generally
reluctant to intervene, particularly as it involves foreign policy.
  I think you suggested that one way of bringing this to a state of
ripeness before the Court would be in a situation in which the
President has committed forces. Congress could pass a resolution
objecting to the action taken by the President, and that might in
and of itself present a justiciable issue or a ripe issue for the Court.
Am I correct?
  Judge GINSBURG. Such a controversy, whatever other threshold
barriers might be argued, would be ripe only if Congress as a body
put itself in opposition to the Executive.
   Senator COHEN. Through a legislative action.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator COHEN. I would like to just ask the one question in an-
other field. It does involve foreign policy, but it is something that
we have dealt with. I will not ask you how you would rule on the
issue, but, rather, the process which Congress might follow.
   In the field of foreign policy, the President generally asserts the
fact that the President is the primary mover, as such, in the field
of foreign policy, the spokesperson for the institution that executes
foreign policy. But Congress also have a role to play and a major
role to play in the formulation of foreign policy. That is clear when
we talk about overt programs.
  We move into a somewhat different field when we talk about cov-
ert programs. There has always been a conflict between the Execu-
tive and the congressional branches dealing with the so-called cov-
ert actions. We saw that during Iran-Contra.
                                                362

  We have a law on the books, that was passed I believe back in
1980, in which Congress said that if a covert action is to be under-
taken, then the President should notify the requisite members,
heads of the committees, intelligence committees and the majority
and minority leaders in both Houses in advance. If that were not
possible to do, then it should be done within a reasonable time-
frame. The assumption was it would be within a relatively short
period of time, a day or two.

  During Iran-Contra, of course, there was no notification of a cov-
ert action that was undertaken by the Executive, and an interpre-
tation was delivered by the Justice Department. The Attorney Gen-
eral wrote an opinion which indicates that the President could give
notice whenever he, or conceivably she, decides to give notice. It
could be a day, it could be 2 days, it could be a week, it could be
a month, it could be 6 months, whenever the President decides. So
you have a basic conflict between the two branches.

  What I would like is to ask you, again not the result, but the
process. Suppose that Congress passes a law which mandates that
a President must notify the congressional leaders of a proposed cov-
ert action within, let's say, a 48-hour period. The President either
allows the bill to become law without signing it or he vetoes it and
the veto is overridden, and the President were to challenge it at
that point, saying it is unconstitutional.

  My assumption would be--and I am very rusty on this issue--
my assumption would be the Court would probably decline to hear
it, because it was not yet ripe, that there was no justiciable issue
before the Court. You can either nod or not, under those cir-
cumstances.

  But let me just take it one step further. Let's suppose the Presi-
dent vetoes the bill, does not challenge its constitutionality, but
simply it is overridden, it becomes law, as such, even though the
President still maintains it is unconstitutional. Let us assume that
he goes forward with a covert action. Congress is placed in a very
difficult position. On the one hand, we can't disclose that the Presi-
dent has undertaken the action, without violating our own respon-
sibilities here. Second, it might very well endanger the lives of
those individuals who are undertaking that particular covert ac-
tion. So we are presented with a dilemma. We cannot cut off fund-
ing, we cannot go public, we cannot really do very much about it.

  Would you recommend under those circumstances, in order to get
a case before the Court procedurally, that Congress pass a resolu-
tion in order to bring the case to the Court, without violating its
own rules about disclosing that--how would we get the case to the
Court is what I am asking you. I am asking you as Professor Gins-
burg, not as Judge Ginsburg.

  Judge GINSBURG. But I am not Professor Ginsburg. I am Judge
Ginsburg and I belong to the third branch. You have a very able
Senate counsel. He has appeared before us a number of times. I
would refer that question to the Office of Senate Counsel for ad-
vice. One thing I can't do is give an advisory opinion, even if the
parties file pleadings for one.

  Senator COHEN. I thought you gave one to Senator Specter ear-
lier about the War Powers Act. One a day?
                                               363

  Judge GINSBURG. No, I spoke of a position I had taken in court
on ripeness. I have taken the position, together with my colleague,
my former colleague Judge McGowan, that these cases are not fare
for the courts, unless and until Members of Congress stand up and
are counted. I was simply repeating a position that I have taken.

  Senator COHEN. Fair enough.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator Hatch.
  Senator COHEN. Thank you
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. I'm sorry, Senator Cohen, I thought
you were finished.
  Senator COHEN. I am finished. Thank you, Judge Ginsburg. I
have a number of questions. I am looking at the clock and I am
looking at you, and you have held up extraordinarily well.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
  Senator COHEN. I thank you for your answers.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Are you sure?
  Senator COHEN. That I am finished?
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.
  Senator COHEN. I am sure for this evening.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Senator Cohen.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
  I am going to wind up, Judge Ginsburg, with one question and
then some comments. The question I have is on the establishment
clause, and I don't want to keep you any longer. It has been a real
ordeal, but it is an important thing, because you have been asked
a wide variety of questions by both sides of the aisle, you have an-
swered an awful lot of questions here, and I have great respect for
your legal acumen.
  On the establishment clause, of course, the establishment clause
of the first amendment provides that Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, as you know. Under the
test devised by the Supreme Court in 1971, the Lemon v. Kurtzman
test, a practice establishes the establishment clause only if, one, it
reflects a clearly secular purpose, two, has the primary effect that
neither advances nor inhibits religion, and, three, avoids an exces-
sive entanglement with religion.
  Judge GINSBURG. Right.
  Senator HATCH. I am very concerned that this abstract, a histori-
cal test is often applied in a manner that is insensitive to practices
that are part and parcel of our political and cultural heritage. In
particular, narrow reliance on the Lemon test ignores the richer
strain of Supreme Court precedent that recognizes that the inter-
pretation of the establishment clause should "comport with what
history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its
guarantees." Of course, I am quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, the case
that you know back in 1984.
  In Justice Brennan's words, "The existence from the beginning of
the Nation's life of a practice is a fact of considerable import in the
interpretation" of the establishment clause. That is in Walz v. Tax
Commissionerin 1970. Now, do you agree or disagree that the his-
torical pedigree of practice should be given considerable weight in
the determination of whether a practice amounts to "the establish-
ment of religion"?
                                               364

  Judge GINSBURG. I can simply cite what I have accepted as en-
tirely compatible with my job as a judge, and that is the historical
practice of opening each court day with "God save the United
States and this Honorable Court." I don't regard that historic prac-
tice as a violation of the establishment clause. If I did, I would
have no business entering court when those words are said.

  Senator HATCH. All right. I think I could press you on that, but
I think that is good enough.

  Let me just do this: You sit back and relax now. I don't think
there are going to be any more questions from anybody, and we are
going to end this hearing for you, but I would like to end it this
way.

  I would like briefly to run through with you some cases you de-
cided that demonstrate in my mind your willingness to issue rul-
ings that you believe to be compelled by the law, even though you
might personally have preferred different results as a matter of
policy. I would just like to kind of end the record with this, because
I admire you for it.

  In the 1990 case of Women's Equity Action League v. Cavazos,
you wrote an opinion holding that because Congress did not intend
to give a cause of action to civil rights groups or anyone else to sue
Federal officials to force them to enforce civil rights laws as those
groups would have them enforced, you as a judge, you ruled, have
no authority to create such a cause of action for those civil rights
groups. You declined an opportunity to legislate from the bench in
that case, even though, from your background as a woman's rights
lawyer, you might have been thought to have been sympathetic to
the plaintiffs.

  Similarly, in another case you decided in 1990, Cokerv. Sullivan,
you wrote an opinion holding that because Congress did not pro-
vide any such cause of action, homeless persons and advocacy
groups could not sue to force the Department of Health and Human
Services to monitor and enforce State compliance with Federal
emergency assistance guidelines. Quite obviously, homeless persons
and their advocacy groups are sympathetic litigants, but you did
not allow that consideration to sway you from applying the rel-
evant law, which was that Congress had not given them the right
to sue that they claim. Now, maybe Congress should have, but they
have not, and you applied the law as it was written.

  In a 1988 case, Randolph v. Meese, you wrote an opinion that
was joined by Judge Silverman, a Reagan appointee, from which
Judge Mikva, a Carter appointee, dissented. In that opinion, you
ruled that an alien who was present in this country on a visitor's
visa and who was denied adjustment of status to permanent resi-
dent alien had to first exhaust her administrative remedies pro-
vided for by law, before seeking judicial recourse.

  Now, this is an elementary principle of administrative law that,
when properly adhered to, as you did in this case, reduces litigation
and permits adjudication, if it must finally occur, to be based on
a fully developed record. Again, you could have bypassed the law,
been an activist judge and resolved that problem well in advance,
whether it was worthy of resolution or not, but you applied the law
as it really was.
                                      365
  In a 1984 case of Dronenburg v. Zech, you alone of the Carter
appointees on the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with Judges
Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia that a homosexual sailor's con-
stitutional challenge to the military's homosexual exclusion policy
was precluded by a controlling Supreme Court decision that had
summarily affirmed the district court decision upholding a Virginia
statute criminalizing homosexual conduct. Your liberal colleagues
on the court wanted you to extend the right of privacy announced
in other cases to this particular situation, but you, properly, in my
view, concluded that the Supreme Court's summarily affirmance
was controlling, and that whatever your own views on the right to
privacy, there was no latitude to apply it in that particular case.
  In the 1983 case of Conair Corporation v. NLRB, raised by some
of my colleagues here, a very significant loss for the labor unions,
they thought, you wrote an opinion that was joined by then Judge
Scalia, over the dissent of Judge Wald. There an employer had en-
gaged in outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices in connec-
tion with an election to determine whether a union should rep-
resent the employees.
  Since the union, however, had not otherwise shown that it had
majority support among the employees for the use of cards des-
ignating the union as their bargaining agent, you ruled that the
NLRB could not impose a bargaining order on that particular em-
ployer. You reasoned that to do so, in the absence of an expression
of majority sentiment, would violate the National Labor Relations
Act principles of freedom of choice and majority rule. In reaching
this result, you disagreed with Warren Court dictum.
  Now, I just cite these few cases, but I believe the ability of a
judge to separate his or her own--and in this case your own--per-
sonal views from the task of interpreting the law is an essential
qualification for the bench, and certainly on the Supreme Court. In
these and other cases, I think you seem to have demonstrated that
quality, and I just want my colleagues in this body to understand
that you have covered a wide variety of issues from the left to the
right. On occasions you are going to disappoint everybody. And I
happen to believe that is probably a pretty good position to be in
to go on the Supreme Court.
  I disagree with you on a number of things, and I am sure you
disagree with me. But that isn't the issue, is it? If we don't want
to politicize the Supreme Court of the United States and we want
to keep that independent so that Justices are not afraid--they don't
have to test the winds before they decide cases--then we have to
keep politicization aware from the Court.
  Frankly, I admire you for--in most cases, I presume that if you
had your own personal policy views that you could implement
merely by a stroke of the pen on the bench and you didn't believe
in the rule of law, you certainly could have done so, and you prob-
ably would have in each of those cases, and others as well.
  But I think it is important for my conservative colleagues to un-
derstand that you have stood there time after time and interpreted
the law the way it was written. There are many times when the
law isn't written clearly. There are many times when there are fine
dividing lines that you have to make decisions on. And I don't con-
                                                366

sider those activist decisions even though I might disagree with one
or more of them.

  The fact of the matter is that I hope my colleagues in this body
realize that you are a person of tremendous integrity, a person of
great legal acumen--you have demonstrated that throughout these
proceedings--a person who has served well on the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, I think one of the most impor-
tant courts in the world, let alone here. And some even have ar-
gued that it may even be more important than the Supreme Court
because of the thousands of issues that they decide every day that
affect all of our lives every day. But, of course, it isn't. The Su-
preme Court has the final say with regard to judicial review mat-
ters.

  But I just want to say in closing that I think you have acquitted
yourself well. I think your family has acquitted themselves well,
and they ought to be very, very proud of you, as you, of course,
have demonstrated you are of them.

  I for one have been uplifted by much of your testimony, and I
would be crazy to not say that there are some things I wish I could
change. But the fact is that I am sure there are things you wish
we up here in the legislative branch would change, too, and you
will be directing us to do so from time to time.

  But I want you to know that you have acquitted yourself well.
You have earned the right, in my opinion, to be on the Supreme
Court before you started to testify, but you have augmented that
right as you have testified here today.

  So I personally am proud of you and the patience that you have
had, the endurance that you have undergone, and the way that you
have undergone it. And I just want you to know that I have great
respect for you. I had it back in 1980 when we first visited. I have
watched you on the court ever since, knowing that someday you
may have this opportunity. And now that you are on the threshold
of having that opportunity, I want to compliment you for all of the
exemplary life that you have lived and the way you are approach-
ing the Court, the way you are approaching the law, and the way
you have over the last 13 years.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator Biden, Senator Hatch and I
were just about to get together--my friend and I were going to get
together and collaborate about recessing this hearing and letting
Judge Ginsburg go to dinner and the like, but then you came back.
So I guess you will have to take the Chair, take the gavel.
  Senator HATCH. I have got to go vote, so you will have to forgive
me, but I wish you well.
  Judge GINSBURG. May I say, if my mother-in-law is watching,
she just loves you, Senator Hatch? [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Well, she is a person of great refinement and
discernment. That is all I can [laughter].
  And I want you to know that I love her, and I haven't even met
her yet. But I intend to.
  I think a great deal of your family, too. They are very fine people.
It is apparent.
  Judge GINSBURG. Thank you.
                                                367

  The CHAIRMAN. I think he likes you, Judge. I only have another
hour-and-a-half of questions. [Laughter.]

  Judge, as I announced earlier, tomorrow morning at 9 a.m., we
will get to see you again pursuant to Senate rule XXVI. Pursuant
to that rule, the Senate will go into closed session to review the
FBI report on you and to consider any other investigative issue any
member wishes to raise, if there are any, in a closed session. An
FBI report is filed on every single nominee, so there is no connota-
tion of an FBI report being filed.

  The closed session will be held in Senate Dirksen room 212,
which is a small room on the other side of this wall in the other
building. This is a separator. The open portion of that hearing will
begin because we will have to have a vote to go into closed session
under the rules.

  The committee will vote in open session. We will then go into
closed session. The transcript of the closed session with you will be
part of the confidential record of the nomination, made available to
all Senators for inspection in a confidential briefing prior to the
vote on the Senate floor.

  As I have said before, from this point forward, starting with
you--and it is delightful to start with you because it is so easy--
a closed hearing will be conducted for every Supreme Court nomi-
nee so that the holding of such a hearing cannot be taken to dem-
onstrate that the committee has received adverse confidential infor-
mation about that nominee, and also to protect the privacy of the
nominee.

  And so, Judge, I concur with the assessment of my friend from
Utah. You have been an extremely good witness. I would also point
out that my concerns about your not answering questions have
been met. You have answered my questions the second day and
third day. At least from my perspective, you have been as forth-
coming as any recent witness we have had. But as I suggested, we
probably will never have a witness to be as forthcoming as we
would like them to be, as I would like them to be. But I understand
the line you have drawn. I respect it, and I respect you.

  So as far as any further public testimony, Judge, with the grace
of God, as my mother would say, and the goodwill of the neighbors,
there will be no more public testimony for you. I have been handed
this gavel. My staff is more anxious for me to rap it than maybe
you are. And so this hearing will adjourn until 9 a.m. tomorrow
morning, where you will go into closed session with us for what I
expect to be a relatively brief meeting, and then we will move for
the staff and the public. After that hearing is concluded, the closed
session, we will move into public session again in this room with
six panels of witnesses who wish to testify relative to this hearing,
this nominee.

  And it is my intention to take that hearing as long as is nec-
essary to finish tomorrow night. If we do not finish tomorrow night
because of the panels, we will be here Saturday. I know the press
is anxious for that to occur. Every one of them knows it is great
to spend Saturday up here. But I don't expect that will go to Satur-
day. And it is my expectation, Judge, we will close down the hear-
ing Friday night or Saturday sometime, and with a little bit of
                                                  368

luck, we will vote in the committee on your nomination very short-
ly thereafter, within a week.

  My intention is to try to get a vote on the floor of the entire Sen-
ate to put you on the Court before we adjourn for August. And that
is the first show of emotion I have seen on the part of your hus-
band, which you could not see. He sat behind you and went like
that. I go like that too.

  We are adjourned.
  [Whereupon, at 7:53 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re-
convene at 9 a.m., Friday, July 23, 1993.]
NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                               FRIDAY, JULY 23, 1993

                                                               U.S. SENATE,
                                            COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:58 a.m., in room
216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee), presiding.
  Also present: Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Heflin, Simon,
Kohl, Feinstein, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen,
and Pressler.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Rule XXVI of the United States Senate provides for committees
to move into closed session for several enumerated reasons. One
provision of that rule permits closure of a meeting if a matter dis-
cussed "will tend to charge an individual with a crime or mis-
conduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing of an indi-
vidual, or otherwise to expose an individual to public contempt
* * * or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the pri-
vacy of an individual."
  A second provision of that rule permits cloture of a meeting if is-
sues discussed may divulge matters required to be kept confiden-
tial--that is, the FBI report--under other provisions of law or Gov-
ernment regulations.
  We will now vote in open session whether or not my colleagues
believe there is sufficient reason under rule XXVI to go back into
closed session. If the vote is that we go back into closed session,
we will retire to the conference room directly behind this wall. We
will discuss the FBI report and the confidential investigative efforts
of the minority and majority staff, and will, as I indicated earlier,
beginning with this nominee and future nominees, call the nominee
into the room to discuss those matters whether or not there is any-
thing in either of those reports that warrants any serious discus-
sion.
  Senator COHEN. Would the Senator yield just on one point?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, I will yield to the Senator from Maine.
  Senator COHEN. Would you make clear for me and the committee
that while we talk about "FBI reports," there is no such thing as
a report? It is an FBI file.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct.

                                                         (369)
                                               370

  Senator COHEN. It is a compilation of interviews conducted by
FBI agents who make no analysis, who seek out no contradiction
and no rebutting witnesses. It is simply a compilation of informa-
tion. It is not a report.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is absolutely correct, Senator, and I know
the Senator from his vast experience on the Intelligence Committee
knows this, and I think it warrants being stated again in public,
which I stated numerous times at the end of the last Supreme
Court hearing.

  The FBI routinely, on every single, solitary nominee for the
Court--as a matter of fact, on every nominee for a significant posi-
tion in the executive branch--routinely does a background check on
that nominee. As part of that background check, it goes and inter-
views employers, folks with whom the individual worked, people
they went to school with, neighbors, and it is almost all on a ran-
dom basis that they do it.

  When they conduct an interview, the FBI agent has a pad of
paper and takes notes, does not even record it, comes back and put
those notes in a file.

  All of that background information is then made available to this
committee for us to peruse. The FBI does not reach any conclusion
as to whether or not someone is good, bad, or indifferent. It is like
that old thing on that program that used to be on in the 1950's:
The facts, ma'am, nothing but the facts. In this case, it is not the
facts. It is: Hearsay, sir, nothing but hearsay. That is what gets
put in the file.

  Senator COHEN. The statements made by individuals are not nec-
essarily identified, they are not made under oath, and they are not
subject to cross-examination.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is exactly correct, unless we then direct the
FBI to go back and do that.

  One other point warrants being made with regard to FBI files.
There is a Federal law designed to protect the person being inves-
tigated routinely, as well as protecting those who participate in the
investigation. When the FBI agent goes to interview a person re-
garding a nominee, that agent says to that interviewee, 'Tour
name will be kept confidential." It is a useful investigative tool, al-
lowing the FBI to garner information that they might not other-
wise be able to garner if they went to the person and said, "By the
way, speak to us and everything you say to me will be made pub-
lic."

  We are not even allowed under the law to share with the nomi-
nee the contents of the FBI report by identifying individuals who
say things within the report. The reason for that is to protect the
anonymity of people who, in fact, are willing to talk to the FBI. It
is an investigative tool.

  Second, we are not allowed to divulge to the public or anyone
under any circumstances any information in the FBI report be-
cause that would violate the rights of the person being inves-
tigated. It would violate their civil rights because what is in that
report is purely hearsay. It has not been corroborated. It has not
been followed up on. It does not relate to any matter of proof. It
is one individual anonymously telling an FBI agent something.
                                         371

  You say, well, if that is the case, why do it? It is an investigative
tool that is the first step in determining whether or not there is
a need to seek out any further information.

  I know there is a vote, but this is so important and so often con-
fused by the press, by the public, and by our colleagues.

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, now--yes, Senator.
   Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I intend to vote to go into
closed session. I have looked at some of the FBI report, but I want
to--I do this because I think the chairman has established the cor-
rect policy that we do this on all such nominees, leaving no infer-
ence whatsoever that my review of the report indicates that there
is anything in question here.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct. That is the committee position.
Now we will vote. The clerk will call the roll about going into
closed session in the conference room behind this large room.
   The CLERK. Mr. Kennedy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Aye, by proxy.
   The CLERK. Mr. Metzenbaum.
   The CHAIRMAN. Aye, by proxy.
   The CLERK. Mr. DeConcini.
   Senator DECONCINI. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Leahy.
   The CHAIRMAN. Aye, by proxy--no, I beg your pardon. We don't
have a proxy. And, by the way, I might note Senator Leahy's son
is having a serious operation today, and that is why he is absent.
   The CLERK. Mr. Heflin.
   Senator HEFLIN. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Simon.
   Senator SIMON. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Kohl.
   Senator KOHL. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mrs. Feinstein.
   Senator FEINSTEIN. Aye.
   The CLERK. MS. Moseley-Braun.
   Senator FEINSTEIN. Aye, by proxy.
   The CHAIRMAN. Aye, by proxy.
   The CLERK. Mr. Hatch.
   Senator HATCH. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Thurmond.
   Senator HATCH. Aye, by proxy.
   The CLERK. Mr. Simpson.
   Senator SIMPSON. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Grassley.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Specter.
   [No response.]
   The CLERK. Mr. Brown.
   Senator BROWN. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Cohen.
   Senator COHEN. Aye.
   The CLERK. Mr. Pressler.
   [No response.]
   The CLERK. Mr. Biden.
                                                372

  The CHAIRMAN. Aye. The vote is 15 to 0 to go into closed session.
The committee will now adjourn. We will go vote, come back and
go into closed session. When that session is completed, we will
come back for the public witnesses who wish to testify on this nom-
ination.

  [The committee recessed to closed session at 10:06 a.m.]
  [A short recess was taken.]
  [The committee resumed in open session at 11:50 a.m.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  We will now begin the portion of the hearing where outside wit-
nesses will come and testify. As is the tradition of the committee
for Lord knows how many years, all the years that I have been
here, over 20--and I think well before that--the honor and in a
sense the duty of the first outside panel, the first person to testify
other than the witness himself or herself has been, on matters re-
lating to the Supreme Court, the American Bar Association.
  By way of very brief background, we ask the American Bar Asso-
ciation, as does the administration--and all have--to do their pro-
fessional analysis of the competence and capability and the fitness
of the nominee to sit on the bench, not only for the Supreme Court
but for all Federal courts. They do their job, in my view, diligently
and, I might add, without remuneration and at considerable ex-
pense of their time and effort. The committee appreciates it very
much.
  Let me call now our first panel of William E. Willis, Esq., Chair-
man of the Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, the Amer-
ican Bar Association, and Mr. Best, also an attorney, the D.C. Cir-
cuit Representative on the Standing Committee on the Federal Ju-
diciary, the American Bar Association in Washington, DC.
  Gentlemen, welcome, and as we have indicated ahead of time, we
have had the advantage of your report, and we are aware of it. We
would truly appreciate it if you would summarize in 5 minutes, if
you would, the findings of the committee. Then we will yield to
committee members for any questions they might have.
  Mr. Willis, welcome.
STATEMENT OF WILLIAM E. WILLIS, CHAIRMAN, STANDING
  COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AMERICAN BAR ASSO-
  CIATION, ACCOMPANIED BY JUDAH BEST, D.C. CIRCUIT REP-
  RESENTATIVE, STANDING COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL JUDICI-
  ARY, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION
  Mr. WILLIS. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the commit-
tee, my name is William E. Willis. I practice law in New York City
and am Chair of the American Bar Association's standing commit-
tee on Federal judiciary. With me today is Judah Best of Washing-
ton, DC, one of our committee members who took a principal role
in this investigation. Bob Watkins, another of our members, in-
tended to be here but was called away today.
  We appear here to present the views of the American Bar Asso-
ciation on the nomination of the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States.

  At the request of the White House, our committee investigated
the professional competence, judicial temperament, and integrity of
Judge Ginsburg. Our work included discussions with more than
625 persons, including Justices of the Supreme Court, Federal and
State judges, a national cross-section of practicing lawyers, and law
school deans and faculty members, some of whom are specialists in
constitutional law, as well as experts on Supreme Court practice.
In addition, Judge Ginsburg's opinions were independently re-
viewed by three reading groups--a reading team of lawyers who
have practiced actively in the Supreme Court, chaired by Rex E.
Lee, former Solicitor General of the United States and currently
president of Brigham Young University; and two panels of law pro-
fessors, one chaired by Professor Ronald J. Allen at Northwestern
University Law School and one chaired by Dean Mark G. Yudof of
the University of Texas Law School. And finally, Judge Ginsburg
was interviewed personally by three members of this committee.

  Our committee began its investigation of Judge Ginsburg on
June 14, 1993, and concluded on July 13, 1993. Based upon our
evaluation, we reported to the White House and to this committee
that the Standing Committee is unanimously of the opinion that
Judge Ginsburg is entitled to the committee's highest evaluation
for a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States: well
qualified. That evaluation is reserved for those who are at the top
of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and wide ex-
perience, meet the highest standards of professional competence,
judicial temperament and integrity, and merit the committee's
strongest affirmative endorsement.

  I have filed with the Judiciary Committee a letter describing the
results of our investigation and shall not repeat those results in de-
tail here. I request that the letter be included in the record of these
proceedings.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will make it a part of the record.
  Mr. WILLIS. Thank you.

Re: Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

   DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter is submitted in response to the invitation from
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to the Standing Committee on Federal Judi-
ciary of the American Bar Association (the "Committee") to present its report re-
garding the nomination of the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

   The Committee's evaluation of Judge Ginsburg is based on its investigation of her
professional qualifications, that is, her integrity, judicial temperament and profes-
sional competence. Consistent with the Committee's long standing policy it did not
undertake any examination or consideration of Judge Ginsburg's political ideology
or her views on any issues that might come before the Supreme Court.

   To merit the Committee's evaluation of Qualified or Well Qualified the Supreme
Court nominee must be at the top of the legal profession, have outstanding legal
ability and wide experience and meet the highest standards of integrity, professional
competence and judicial temperament. The evaluation of Well Qualified is reserved
for those found to merit the Committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.
                                          374

  I am pleased to report that the Committee finds Judge Ginsburg to be Well Quali-
fied for appointment as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States. This determination was unanimous.

                        THE PROCESS

  The investigation of Judge Ginsburg began on June 14, 1993 and ended on July
13, 1994. Judge Ginsburg was interviewed personally by members of the Committee.

  In conducting the investigation members of the Committee personally interviewed
over 400 federal judges, including present and retired members of the Supreme
Court of the United States, members of the Federal Court of Appeals, members of
the Federal District Courts, Federal Magistrate Judges, Federal Bankruptcy Judges,
and members of State Courts. The investigation included colleagues of Judge Gins-
burg from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Members of the Committee personally questioned approximately 225 others, in-
cluding practicing lawyers throughout the United States, former law clerks and law-
yers who have appeared before Judge Ginsburg. Committee members inquired of
law school deans, faculty members of law schools and constitutional scholars
throughout the United States, including professors at Rutgers University and Co-
lumbia University Law School, where Judge Ginsburg served as a member of the
faculty.

The Committee also had at its disposal the report prepared in 1980 by the Com-
mittee in connection with the investigation of Judge Ginsburg for appointment to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She was
at that time found by   a majority of the   CapopmominittmteeenttotobethEaxtcceoputirotn.1ally  Well  Quali-
fied and by a minority  Well Qualified for

It has been the practice of the Committee to ask groups of distinguished legal
scholars and Supreme Court practitioners to review independently all of the opin-
ions of nominees for the Supreme Court. This practice was followed again here and
Judge Ginsburg's opinions were reviewed by: (1) a Reading Group of distinguished
lawyers chaired by Rex E. Lee, formerly Solicitor General of the United States and
presently President of Brigham Young University. This group consisted of 11 law-
yers, all of whom have practiced and argued cases in the Supreme Court; (2) a
Reading Group chaired by Professor Ronald J. Allen of the Northwestern University
School of Law, consisting of 21 members of that law school's faculty; and (3) a Read-
ing Group composed of 12 professors from the University of Texas Law School,
chaired by its Dean, Mark G. Yudof.2

  The three Reading Groups reported to the Committee their independent analyses
of Judge Ginsburg's opinions. These reports were evaluated by the members of our
Committee, each of whom also read opinions of Judge Ginsburg and her published
writings on a variety of legal subjects.

                                                           EVALUATION

Integrity
  Judge Ginsburg has earned and enjoys an excellent general reputation for her in-

tegrity and her character. No one interviewed by the Committee had any question
or doubt in this respect.

Temperament
  Judge Ginsburg's judicial temperament also meets the high standards set by the

Committee for appointment to the Supreme Court.
  A very few who were interviewed commented on what they perceived as her tend-

ency to be a "loner" and questioned her ability to be collegial. Such reservations
were wholly dispelled by comments from her colleagues who have known and
worked closely with her over the years who uniformly found her to be collegial and
to be a consensus builder.

  The Committee also investigated a published comment claiming that Judge Gins-
burg had bad relationships with her law clerks. Our investigation, including inter-
views with virtually all of her former clerks now living throughout the country,
found such claim to be without foundation. From our interviews with her former law
clerks it is apparent that she enjoys a group of fiercely loyal former clerks who re-
gard her with admiration and respect and who enthusiastically support her appoint-
ment. Moreover, she and her clerks have remained in close personal contact over

  1 In 1980 the Committee's highest rating for lower court judges was Exceptionally Well Quali-
fied. This rating was subsequently discontinued. The highest rating is now Well Qualified for
all courts.

  2 Members of the three Reading Groups who participated are listed on Exhibit A to this letter.
                                              375

the years, and she has regularly followed and supported the family and professional
development of many of them. The training received by the clerks in Judge Gins-
burg's chambers resulted in many being selected as law clerks by several Supreme
Court Justices.

  There were isolated comments from several lawyers who had practiced in her
court that she could on occasion be impatient in questioning at oral argument. Such
comments were^earefully investigated. Judge Ginsburg is a judge who prepares thor-
oughly for every oral argument by reading the briefs, defining the issues and formu-
lating questions to present to counsel. The overwhelming majority of counsel respect
this preparation, welcome the judge's questions, and find no basis for any complaint
as to her questioning during oral argument.

  Judge Ginsburg clearly possesses and exhibits the highest level of judicial tem-
perament.
Professional Competence

  Judge Ginsburg's educational background amply prepared her for Supreme Court
service. She graduated at the top of ner class at Cornell University, attended Har-
vard Law School for two years and served with its top students on its Law Review
and completed her legal training at Columbia Law School where she also was at
the top of the class and served as an editor of its Law Review.

  Her scholarship led to an academic career which began at Rutgers University Law
School, where she served for 9 years and was named Professor of Law, and contin-
ued at Columbia Law School, where she served with distinction as Professor of Law
for 8 years.

   She also comes with extensive experience as an appellate advocate, including six
cases in which she was counsel of record and argued in the Supreme Court. She
has not had trial experience, but she served for two years as law clerk to one of
New York's most distinguished district judges.

   She has developed and maintained broad interests. Throughout her career she has
participated actively in bar association work, serving in leadership capacities in sev-
eral organizations, is an active member of the American Law Institute, serving on
its Council, has participated actively in the work of the American Bar Association,
and since ascendancy to the Bench has been active in court administration and the
preparation of a history of the District of Columbia Circuit.

   Her extensive scholarly writings cover wide-ranging subjects. She has, for exam-
ple, written extensively on the law of Sweden, civil rights, the rights of women, pri-
vate international law, constitutional law issues and even the confirmation process
for Supreme Court Justices. These writings not only reflect the high level of her
scholarship but the breadth of her interests, qualities that will contribute to her ef-
fective service as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

   The comprehensive reports submitted to us by the three Reading Groups of schol-
ars and Supreme Court practitioners confirm the Committee's own conclusions con-
cerning the scholarship and writing ability of Judge Ginsburg.

   One group used such words in describing her opinions as "lawyerly" "thoughtful"
"careful" "measured, clear, precise and judicious."

   The report of another of the three Reading Groups summarized Judge Ginsburg's
writings as follows: Judge Ginsburg has an unmistakable and deeply ingrained style
of decision. She invariably lays out the case with remarkable clarity, informing the
reader of the relevant procedural background and precisely what is to be decided.
She then proceeds to explain the decision the court has reached with great care and
attention to detail in direct and accessible prose. She has no rhetorical or literary
flair that we observe, but what her opinions lack in inspiration they compensate for
in lucidity. She obviously strives hard to be fair, even-handed, and open-minded,
and she adequately addresses all relevant arguments in the cases she decides.

   The third group commented with respect to her opinions that they "are uniformly
well crafted" and that their "greatest virtue . . . is their clarity." "The reader comes
away convinced that no stone has been left unturned in rehearsing the state of the
record, the parties' contentions or the applicable doctrines." The report noted that
after recognizing and identifying critical issues "she sets forth facts pertaining to
the issues and then deals with the cases and other apposite authority in a scholarly
fashion." There were also favorable comments on the brevity and conciseness of her
opinions. One of the Reading Group members noted: "She is bright, able, sincere,
and apparently a hard worker. Moreover, she is committed to being an excellent ju-
rist and is a better writer than many of her colleagues. She graces the bench with
style and understanding and the confidence of one with a well-trained mind and a
sense of herself."

  This group also specifically commented on her concern with the institutional
needs of the court and the necessity for maintaining collegiality. A member noted

      75-974 O - 94 -- 13
                                              376

that "few of [her] opinions have an edge or sting to them," and that her comments
"are usually relatively mild in dismissing an argument that she finds unpersuasive
or unfounded." The report noted that from the tone of her opinions "she genuinely
cares about the collegial dimension of appellate judging."

  Our Committee is fully satisfied that Judge Ginsburg meets the highest standard
of professional competence required for a seat on the Supreme Court. Her academic
training, her work as an appellate advocate, her service on the faculties of distin-
guished law schools, her scholarly writings and her distinguished service for thir-
teen years on the Court of Appeals dealing with many of the same kind of matters
that will come before the Supreme Court fully establish her professional com-
petence.

                                                          CONCLUSION

  Based on the information available to it, the Committee is of the unanimous opin-
ion that Judge Ginsburg is Well Qualified for appointment to the Supreme Court
of the United States. This is the Committee's highest rating for a Supreme Court
nominee.

  The Committee will review its report at the conclusion of the public hearings and
notify you if any circumstances have developed that would require a modification
of these views.

  On behalf of our Committee, we wish to thank you and the members of the Judici-
ary Committee for the invitation to participate in the confirmation hearings on the
nomination of Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  Respectfully submitted,

                                                                                         WILLIAM E. WILLIS, Chair.

  Mr. WILLIS. TO summarize our findings, the committee is fully
satisfied that, by virtue of her academic training, her work as an
appellate advocate, her academic service, her scholarly writings,
and her distinguished service for 13 years on the court of appeals,
Judge Ginsburg meets the highest standards of professional com-
petence required for a seat on the Supreme Court. She enjoys the
admiration and respect of her colleagues on and off the bench, and
her integrity is above reproach.

  We are pleased to have the opportunity to appear here today to
present the committee's findings and would be happy to respond to
any questions about our evaluation.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I only have one question. Was there any dissenting vote on the
committee at all?
  Mr. WILLIS. There was no dissenting vote whatsoever, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO it was unanimous that the highest rating that
the American Bar Association gives in this circumstance was unan-
imous; each individual, no one abstaining, voted for that rating?
  Mr. WILLIS. NO abstentions. Every member of the committee
voted for the rating of well qualified.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have no further questions. I only want to thank
you again because I think people vastly underrate the incredible
amount of work that you all undertake. We in this committee know
because our staffs read every one of the opinions. We know what
it is like.
  You are in active practice at the time while you are doing it. We
appreciate it, and I would like to publicly extend my thanks to you,
both of you, and to the Bar Association generally for being willing
to perform this function.
   I yield now to my friend from Utah.
   Senator HATCH. I want to join in that praise because I think the
changes that have been made at the ABA and the renewed look at
the committee and the restructuring of the committee have been
very excellent. And I know that it takes a lot of time. It is a lot
of effort. You folks are doing a tremendous job for the benefit of the
legal community at large, but really for the public at large. And I
just want to personally compliment you. I am glad to see that the
committee has approached this in an apolitical way, as it should,
and I just want to personally acknowledge that in front of every-
body here today.
   So thank you for the efforts you have put forth, the testimony
you have given, and the work that you all have done.
                                                378

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. WILLIS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I want to join my colleagues in thanking
you for your efforts, but I sort of think that my good friend from
Utah's comment was a little bit negatively pregnant with the fact
that you have suddenly gotten religion and now you are doing a
good job. And I have the feeling that you have done a good job over
the years. I haven't always agreed with your conclusions. Most of
the time I have. But I thought I was really bemused when some-
times in the past the ABA was accused of being too liberal. I was
a practicing lawyer, and I have been a member of the ABA for a
long time. And I never thought it was a liberal organization. Quite
the opposite, I thought it was too damn conservative.
  But having said that
  Senator HATCH. Of course, he thinks everything is too damn con-
servative. [Laughter.]
  Senator METZENBAUM. Especially you, Orrin. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Well, I think I probably am.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO far things are going well. Senator, do you
have any further comment?
  Senator METZENBAUM. With that said, thanks very much for all
your efforts.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to take just a moment or two to discuss the one
question which really concerns me about the confirmation proceed-
ings, and I join in expressing appreciation for the work that your
organization has done. Your work, of course, was completed before
these hearings started. I have already expressed my concerns about
how much information we got on judicial ideology and judicial phi-
losophy.
  I was concerned, illustratively, that on a question about whether
the Korean military engagement was a war raising the constitu-
tional issue about the authority of the Congress to declare war.
Judge Ginsburg wanted to have it briefed and argued before she
would make a statement. Certainly the Korean conflict is not going
to come before the Court, and I think many of the other questions
which were asked on ideology and philosophy come into the same
line.
  When we had Justice Scalia, then Judge Scalia, for confirmation
and I asked him about Marbury v. Madison as a pillar of constitu-
tional interpretation that the Supreme Court is the final word, he
wouldn't answer the question because it was an issue which he
thought might come before the Court. At that time I expressed the
sentiment, as I did with Judge Ginsburg, that so far as I am con-
cerned that issue is rockbed; and if someone is not going to uphold
Marbury v. Madison, I don't think that person is fit to serve on the
Supreme Court.
  I think Justice Scalia would uphold Marbury v. Madison, which
was my conclusion, and I voted for him. But he wouldn't say. The
question about whether the Congress has the power to take away
jurisdiction of the Court on constitutional issues, I think, is also
rockbed. I don't think that is subject to being litigated.
                                      379

  I asked Judge Ginsburg whether she would rule out Congress'
authority to take away the jurisdiction of the Court on equal pro-
tection, an issue on which she is really a champion. And in my
questioning of Judge Scalia, it took all the way to a question of,
"Will you let somebody litigate after you are on the Supreme Court
the question of whether you have an obligation under your oath to
uphold the Constitution?" "Judge Scalia: I think you have finally
gone over the edge of certainty so much that I have to say of course
not."

  But that is what it took to find an answer for Justice Scalia that
he wouldn't have litigated before his Court.

  Judge Ginsburg wrote an article on the authority of the Senate
giving a second opinion after the President gives the first opinion,
said it was not a secondary opinion; and at the conclusion of the
article, she accepted the language of her former Columbia col-
league, Prof. Louis Henken, to this effect: In an appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court, the Senate comes second but is not secondary.
The standards the Senate should apply are the same as those that
should govern the President, what would serve the national inter-
est, not simply for today's cases but for the long term.

  And I would just like your opinion, if you would give it to me,
Mr. Willis, Mr. Best. Do you think it is within the purview appro-
priately of a Senator to vote against a nominee who won't answer
questions, say to the extent that Judge Scalia took a question
about challenging his oath before he would respond?

  Mr. WILLIS. I won't myself pretend to give advice to a Senator
on a subject like that. I think the Senator has to use his own con-
science and conviction in deciding what action to take.

  I should emphasize that the work of our committee is limited to
investigating the qualifications of the nominee with respect to in-
tegrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence. We do
not get into philosophy. We do not get into where the judge, the
judicial candidate stands with respect to a particular issue.

  Obviously the interest of this body may very well be broader
than that, but when it comes to integrity, professional competence,
and judicial temperament, Judge Ginsburg has our very strong en-
dorsement.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Willis, you are a New Yorker?

   Mr. WILLIS. Yes, sir.

  Senator SPECTER. I hope you run for the Senate so you can give
me some advice.

  Mr. Best, you are from the District of Columbia. I hope you have
a chance to run for the Senate.

  Mr. BEST. Well, I would be pleased to have that opportunity
sometime, Senator.

  Senator SPECTER. What is your view on my question?
  Mr. BEST. Well, my view is coincident with Bill Willis. We have
a very narrow spectrum of interest, and certainly if I ever decide
to run for the Senate, then maybe I could address the issue of
whether or not there is discretion in a U.S. Senator on the issue
that you have presented.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Best. Thank you,
Mr. Willis.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. I just got here. Does somebody else want to ask
questions?
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Senator Feinstein.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. I have no questions. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I have always enjoyed listening to you,
and I think you all do a very thorough job on this type of work.
I always somewhat feel like somehow you ought to have a profes-
sional staff. It calls for a tremendous amount of work that is called
upon for each individual member, in particular relative to the Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals in the District Court. It does call for a tre-
mendous amount of work. I at one time made a speech on the floor
advocating that you consider a staff, but you always felt like it was
more of a lawyer approach that you wanted.
  But, anyway, we appreciate the effort by the American Bar, and
I think it does have a great deal of weight pertaining to nominees,
in particular the work that you do reading every opinion and re-
searching everything else. It is rather remarkable that you spend
as much time as you do.
  But as I understand it, you are unanimous in the highest rating
here. Is that correct?
  Mr. WILLIS. That is correct, Senator. The entire committee re-
viewed the entire record and concluded unanimously, without any
dissent or abstention, that Judge Ginsburg deserved the highest
recommendation.
  Mr. BEST. And without any hesitation.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, that is remarkable. Without any debate?
  Mr. WILLIS. There was obviously discussion. I don't think it got
to the level of debate, but I think that every member participated
actively in the discussions that followed the completion of the
record.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Gentlemen, again, thank you. Please thank the entire committee.
I sincerely mean it when I say that on behalf of the whole commit-
tee, we appreciate the incredible amount of work you do, and the
service you provide.
  Mr. WILLIS. I will do that, Senator, and thank you very much.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley may have some
questions. His staff member was trying to find him. But what we
will do, if we can keep the record open to submit those questions
in writing, I think that would be fine.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done.

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM E. WILLIS

  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
  My name is William E. Willis. I practice law in New York City, and I am Chair
of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. With
me today is Judah Best of Washington, D.C., one of our Committee members who
took a principal role in this investigation
  We appear here to present the views of the American Bar Association on the nom-
ination of the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Judge of the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to be Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States.
                                          381

  At the request of the White House, our Committee investigated the professional
competence, judicial temperament and integrity of Judge Ginsburg. Our work in-
cluded discussions with more than 625 persons, including Justices of the Supreme
Court, federal and state judges, a national cross section of practicing lawyers, and
law school deans and faculty members, some of whom are specialists in constitu-
tional law, and experts on Supreme Court Practice. In addition, Judge Ginsburg's
opinions were independently reviewed by three reading groups--a reading team of
lawyers who have practiced actively in the Supreme Court, chaired by Rex E. Lee,
former Solicitor General of the United States and currently President of Brigham
Young University, and two panels of law professors, one chaired by Professor Ronald
J. Allen at Northwestern University Law School and one chaired by Dean Mark G.
Yudof of the University of Texas School of Law. And finally, Judge Ginsburg was
interviewed by three members of our Committee.

  The Committee began its investigation of Judge Ginsburg on June 14, 1993, and
ended on July 13, 1993. Based upon our evaluation, we reported to the White House
and to this Committee that the Standing Committee is unanimously of the opinion
that Judge Ginsburg is entitled to the Committee's highest evaluation for a nominee
to the Supreme Court of the United States: Well Qualified. That evaluation is re-
served for those who are at the top of the legal profession, have outstanding legal
ability and wide experience, meet the highest standards of professional competence,
judicial temperament and integrity, and merit the Committee's strongest affirmative
endorsement.

  I have filed with the Judiciary Committee a letter describing the results of our
investigation, and shall not repeat those results in detail here. I request that the
letter be included in the record of these proceedings.

  To summarize our findings, the Committee is fully satisfied that, by virtue of her
academic training, her work as an appellate advocate, her academic service, her
scholarly writings, and her distinguished service for thirteen years on the Court of
Appeals, Judge Ginsbug meets the highest standards of professional competence re-
quired for a seat on the Supreme Court. She enjoys the admiration and respect of
her colleagues on and off the bench and her integrity is above reproach.

  We are pleased to have the opportunity to appear here today to present to Com-
mittee's findings and would be happy to respond to questions about our evaluation.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW our next panel is comprised of leading fig-
ures in the legal community. The first is William T. Coleman, Jr.,
of O'Melveny and Myers. Mr. Coleman served as Secretary of
Transportation during the Ford administration from 1975 to 1977,
and Mr. Coleman stands as one of the Nation's pre-eminent law-
yers, particularly civil rights lawyers, having argued many land-
mark cases with the last Justice Thurgood Marshall. As a matter
of fact, I believe he was Thurgood Marshall's attorney as well. He
also is presently chairman of the board of the NAACP Legal De-
fense and Education Fund.

  Welcome, Mr. Secretary.
  Next is Judge Shirley Hufstedler. She is a former United States
Circuit Court of Appeals judge for the Ninth Circuit, and served as
Secretary of Education during the Carter administration. She is
presently a partner in a leading law firm.
  Joining them are Chesterfield Smith of Holland & Knight of
Miami, FL, former president of the American Bar Association. Good
to see you back, Mr. Smith.
  Mr. SMITH. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Aiid Ira Millstein, a senior partner of Weil,
Gotshal, and Manges in New York City.
  We welcome you all, and I should say, with no reflection on Mr.
Millstein and Mr. Smith, were I president two of the four people
sitting before me would be my choices for the Supreme Court of the
United States, and I say that without reservation. Mr. Coleman,
you would make a great Supreme Court Justice. I wish I had had
an opportunity to participate in having you on the Court; as well
                                                    382

as you, Judge Hufstedler. I know you both well, and it is a com-
pliment to the nominee that you two are here, as well as the other
two of your colleagues are here.

  Senator HEFLIN. I will take exception at your omission of Ches-
terfield Smith. I don't know Mr. Millstein as well, but he

  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Millstein, you are qualified as well to be on
the Court, but I mean it. I think the Nation would have been
served extremely well had William T. Coleman been a Supreme
Court Justice.

  But having said that, enough of my advertising for future nomi-
nees for the Court. Let me

  Senator SPECTER. It may be yet, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know. I said that. That is why I don't want to
continue to advertise, because I learned one lesson, at least as it
related to my children in the colleges and universities they attend.
Whatever university you want your child to attend, do not mention
it. Whoever you would like to see appointed to the Supreme Court,
don't tell the President.
  But, at any rate, Mr. Coleman, why don't you begin.

PANEL CONSISTING OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.,
  OTVIELVENY AND MYERS, WASHINGTON, DC; CHESTERFIELD
  SMITH, HOLLAND & KNIGHT, MIAMI, FL; SHIRLEY M.
  HUFSTEDLER, HUFSTEDLER, KAUS, AND ETTINGER, LOS AN-
  GELES, CA; AND IRA M. MILLSTEIN, WEIL, GOTSHAL AND
  MANGES, NEW YORK, NY

              STATEMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I have
submitted a seven-page statement, but then there are attached
some memoranda because I either read or had people read and
then explain to me most of the judge's cases. I certainly think that
with her background and everything she certainly should be con-
sidered well qualified.

  But I would like just to indicate to you why in my judgment this
is a superb appointment, because I think that you have to look to
the character of the person, for in the end, particularly in constitu-
tional matters, the only sense on a Justice's exercise of power is his
or her own sense of self-restraint.

  Now, the factors that I think that you ought to consider, first, is
what she has been exposed to and done with her life in the last
60 years: a great education, a superior mind, great intellect and in-
telligence, her seizing of every opportunity, and her just being able
to discharge both the responsibilities in the profession, but also as
a wife and mother.

   She certainly has made an outstanding record as a jurist. I think
if you would look at her readings and just walk through her library
and just watch the diversity of things that she has read, in addi-
tion you often will see her at the opera, the theater, the symphony,
the ballet, the art museum, the Council on Foreign Relations. And
she has, as you already know, a very wide range of friends. And,
believe me, as quiet as she is, she will discuss and argue almost
any issue with them. She has written in a lot of different fields.
                                                  383

  With it all, however, we still know the great Justices had to have
something that touched them with fire. Holmes had his Civil War.
Frankfurter had his battles as an immigrant coming to this coun-
try at age 12, not speaking a word of English, and, as once he said,
"belonging] to the most vilified and persecuted minority in his-
tory." Chief Justice Marshall had his battles to make this country
a Nation, and Thurgood Marshall his battles to end racial segrega-
tion and all the deleterious effects thereof.

  In Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I have confidence that the fire was set
by the discrimination Ruth Bader Ginsburg encountered when she
first came to the bar and by the challenges she met in developing
legal theories which ended some of such discrimination and unfair-
ness. But even more important, that fire rests in her disciplined de-
sire that she excel as a judge, as a legal scholar, as an American,
and as a human being.

  So I urge this committee to advise and consent favorably for this
nomination. I also want to congratulate the country, the legal pro-
fession, President Clinton, our great educational and cultural insti-
tutions, and the Ginsburg family that in this case the process and
system worked, and worked quite well.

  I would like to conclude by adding something which may create
a slight controversy. That is, on the first day when Judge Ginsburg
was introduced, the senior Senator from New York indicated that
Justice Frankfurter would not even interview her. I speak as a
former Justice Frankfurter law clerk. I would ask that be checked
and not be made a part of history. I became his law clerk in 1948.
I know that in 1953 when a lady whose last name was Holmes and
was the first one to make the Harvard Law Review, that he at that
time indicated that, gee, she would be a great law clerk.

  In addition, because the statement was made that he would not
interview her, the fact is that Justice Frankfurter would interview
no one. I was not interviewed by him. His law clerks were selected
by Henry Hart, Paul Freund, and, later on, Al Sachs. I say that
only to try to keep the record straight. In my heart, I just feel that
Felix Frankfurter had the judgment and wisdom that I know Judge
Ginsburg has to have the vision that in this country we have the
ability to recognize those of great ability.

  Thank you.
  [The prepared statement of Mr. Coleman follows:]

                          PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, Jr.

   The country is fortunate that the end result of the Presidential selection process
to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States arising from the re-
tirement of the Honorable Justice Byron Raymond White was the nomination of
someone with the talent of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg who with her heart, char-
acter, determination and background gives promise that she will be a worthy addi-
tion to the highest Court.

  Among the bar and in the academic community, there is no doubt that Judge
Ginsburg ranks among the best jurists who presently sit on the various Courts of
Appeals in the United States.1

   11 have read or caused to be read and explained to me all of the cases that Judge Ginsburg
has written that could be classified as civil rights cases, all cases dealing with the standing to
raise such issues, including personal constitutional issues, and all cases dealing with constitu-
tional issues involving individuals rights. Attached hereto are three interesting and excellent
memoranda that were of great aid in this task.
                                              384

  She brought to the Court of Appeals bench a mind well honed by training at two
of the nation's best law schools--Harvard and Columbia--served on the law review
of each of these schools and had a magna cum laude performance. Previously there-
to she was a stellar student at Cornell University. Thereafter she became a law pro-
fessor, teaching conflict of laws, civil procedures, both national and international,
constitutional law and also acquired learning in the law of Sweden. So as not to
be completely cloistered in the life of academia, she got involved in litigation that
helped women greatly on their road to equality. All who have been exposed to her
recognize that she is bright, able, sincere and apparently (so much of a jurist's and
scholar's work is done in solitude) a hard worker. Moreover, she is committed to
being an excellent jurist and is a better writer than many of her colleagues. She
graces the bench on which she presently serves with style and understanding and
the confidence of one with a well trained mind and a sense of herself.

  But initiates know that excellent technical skill as a federal Court of Appeals or
district court judge or as a judge on any state court, does not necessarily mean that
that person will do well on the Supreme Court. For as Justice Flex Frankfurter re-
minded us:

  ". . . One is entitled to say without qualification that the correlation between
prior judicial experience and fitness for the functions of the Supreme Court is zero.
The significance of the greatest among the Justices who had such experience,
Holmes and Cardozo, derived not from that judicial experience but from the fact
that they were Holmes and Cardozo. They were thinkers, and most particularly
legal philosophers. The seminal ideas of Holmes, by which to so large an extent he
changed the whole atmosphere of legal thinking, are formulated by him before he
ever was a judge in Massachusetts. And while the court of appeals gave Cardozo
an opportunity to express his ideas in opinions, Cardozo was Cardozo before he be-
came a judge. On the other side, Bradley and Brandeis had the preeminent qualities
they had and brought to the Court, without any training that judicial experience
could have given them." 105 U. of Penn. L. Rev. 781 (1957).

  Thus for me and more particularly for you we must find elsewhere the indicia to
predict success on the Supreme Court of the United States. Such search requires
some informed judgment as to the possible issues that will come before the Court
during the nominee's tenure. For the issues before the Supreme Court are usually
difficult, novel and few judges on the courts below have come to grips with them
on a regular basis. The great issues other than the few that involve war and peace,
international relations, basic business relationships, and the reach of statutes en-
acted to benefit the general welfare, deal with how to balance the existence of a
democratic society based upon majority rule with the fact that minorities, women
and other discrete groups have rights and concerns that often are not properly rec-
ognized (or indeed sometimes are denigrated) by the majority. This grows in part
out of the fact that two groups not present at the Constitutional Convention in 1789
were blacks and women. And the poor in this country, though not small in number,
often have no champions in the federal and state legislative chambers despite Mr.
Lincoln's statement that God must have loved the poor because he made so many
of them.

  Each of us can pick the issues that will likely come before the Court that we hope
a resilient, acute and understanding mind can resolve correctly. Abortion is and will
be with us for a long time. Church and state, free speech, and privacy are always
recurring issues; the important issues of the rights of a criminal defendant in a civ-
ilized society, including the recurring issues of habeas corpus and search and sei-
zure and the right to adequate counsel. Questions surrounding sexual orientation
and complicated voting rights issues have an increasing call on the Court docket.
And though we have become one nation, federalism for many of us is thought to
be a strength and calls upon the Court to revisit the issues of state sovereignty
every so often. If we would ask civil rights lawyers to describe some of the chal-
lenges before the Court they would include:

  (1) how to overrule Croson or distinguish it so that state and local set aside pro-
grams are still valid; (2) how to preserve the provisions of the Voting Rights Acts
of 1965 and 1982 designed to ensure election of more representatives who are re-
sponsive to minority voters (in other words, to overrule or limit greatly the effect
of Justice O'Connor's decision in Shaw v. Reno, 61 U.S.L.W. 4818 (June 28, 1993)
(5--4 decision)); (3) how to make effective the provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act
concerning burdens of proof in employment discrimination cases (including to limit
or overrule St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 61 U.S.L.W. 4782 (June 25, 1993) (5-
5 decision); and (4) how to overrule or minimize the effect of San Antonio Indep.
Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973) (5-4 decision), which refused to upset a
Texas school finance system which permitted poor, mostly minority, children living
                                       385

in poor school districts to study in much lower quality schools than children living
in affluent, mostly white school districts.
  And, if the political process with respect to eliminating poverty continues to fail
the society as it did on race and sexual issues until 1960, the Court may be asked
to take bold steps to address that problem.
  What is there in Judge Ginsburg's record and background that would give you
confidence that, if given the opportunity, she will approach each of the difficult is-
sues properly, even though you may or may not agree with the result? For so much
of the confidence and acceptance of Court decisions in difficult social and political
issues depend upon the integrity of the opinions written and the character of the
Court's members. For in the end, particularly in constitutional matters, the only
check on a Justice's exercise of power is his or her own sense of self-restraint. First
is what she has been exposed to and done with herself over the last 60 years--a
great education, a superior mind, great intellect and intelligence, her seizing and
taking advantage of opportunities in both the academic and professional worlds and
mixing with great success her professional life and responsibilities as a mother and
a wife. Second, she has acquitted herself extremely well as a jurist recognized by
the bar and greatly appreciated by her colleagues. Third, her reading and experi-
ences are far beyond the law. She is as familiar with Locke, Rousseau, Keynes,
Nietzsche, Santayana, Voltaire, Longfellow, Montesquieu and de Tocqueville, to
name a few of her reading companions, as she is with Holmes' Common Law,
Cardozo's The Nature of the Judicial Process and Blackstone. (A visit to her well
used library at home would be a treat and a challenge to us all.) You will often see
her at the opera, the theater, the symphony, the ballet, art museums, the Council
on Foreign Relations. Next she has a wide range of friends and will discuss just
about any subject. She has written books and law review articles, given talks in
many diverse fields and traveled extensively.

  With it all, however, we still know that the great justices had something that
"touched them with fire." Holmes had his Civil War battles, Frankfurter had his
battles as an immigrant coming to this country at 12, not speaking a word of Eng-
ilnishhiasntodr,ya."s2  he once said,  "belonging] to the most  vilified and persecuted minority
                        Chief Justice  Marshall his battles to  make this country a nation and
Thurgood Marshall his battles to end racial segregation and all the deleterious ef-
fects thereof.
  In Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg I have confidence that that fire was set by the
discrimination Ruth Bader Ginsburg encountered when she first came to the bar
and by the challenges she met in developing legal theories which ended some of
such discrimination and unfairness. That fire also rests in her disciplined desire
that she excel as a judge, as a legal scholar, as an American, and as a human being.

  I thus urge that your Committee recommend that the Senate favorably advises
and consents to the President's nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as an As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. And I congratulate the
country, the legal profession, President Clinton, our great educational and cultural
institutions, and the Ginsburg family that in this case the process and system
worked and worked quite well.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Chesterfield Smith, former president, but once a president,
always a president. Mr. President.

               STATEMENT OF CHESTERFIELD SMITH
  Mr. SMITH. Forever.
  The greatest interest of my life as a trial lawyer has been the
justice system, the quality of justices and judges. I have worked at
it. I have cared about it. I have been right and wrong in my posi-
tions. I have changed and modified. But in an unyielding and un-
ceasing way, I have been devoted to it.
  Without reservation, Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg in my
opinion will, if confirmed, be an absolutely magnificent Supreme
Court Justice. As both a lawyer and a person, I know her quite
well, perhaps extremely well. I believe that she possesses the tem-
perament, the character, and the professional skills and abilities

2 Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 646 (1943).
                                              386

necessary to go up to my standard of an absolutely superior mem-
ber of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  She is scholarly, reflective, judicious, and humane. She knows
when to act with vigor, but equally important, she knows when not
to act. And she has the wisdom and experience to know in those
actions the value of judicial restraint.

  As both a lawyer and a judge, she is extremely experienced in
appellate practice and procedure at all levels. As a lawyer, she her-
self has both briefed and orally argued with great skill multiple
cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. And as an appellate judge, her
industry and skill have been recognized nationwide for more than
a dozen years.

  However, she is not limited to just appellate skills. She is a per-
son well versed and experienced in all aspects of the law as it will
be presented from time to time for decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  While I recognize it to be a very broad statement, I firmly be-
lieve--and I have a large acquaintance in the American law estab-
lishment because I was a bar politician for so many years. I firmly
believe that there is no single lawyer in America, male or female,
better qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. Truly she is excep-
tional. Certainly I personally like Ruth Ginsburg. I have served
and participated through the years with her in multiple activities.
But I fervently assert that my endorsement of her to you for con-
firmation is based solely on my idea of merit. Over the years I have
become convinced that she has one of the superior legal minds that
I have ever been around, talked to, argued with, discussed or de-
bated.

  Her legal writing suits me. It is succinct, pithy, concise, schol-
arly, and absolutely on target. She conserves energy and words.
While her experience and intent perhaps have been focused pri-
marily on procedure and constitutional law, I find that she has a
broad and roving interest in all aspects of law and justice. She
truly loves the law, and she represents it as its best.

  Additionally, she is a completely well-rounded person who has
the professional and personal capacity to bring to her judicial du-
ties wisdom, moderation, compassion, and justice in the myriad
areas of the law routinely a part of the Supreme Court docket.

  As a citizen, I strongly urge that you speedily confirm her ap-
pointment to the Court. As a trial lawyer, I tell you that she is the
kind of judge that I want to go before and advocate causes because
I believe that she will consider the facts and the law of that case
and make a right and proper decision under the law.

  Thank you very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. High praise, Mr. Smith. Thank you.
  Judge, welcome.

                STATEMENT OF JUDGE HUFSTEDLER
  Judge HUFSTEDLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Because I was admitted to the bar 43 years ago when the num-
ber of women who went into law were very, very few, in my enthu-
siastic endorsement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the U.S. Supreme
Court I thought it might be useful to place what Ruth has accom-
plished in a somewhat broader historical framework.
  When President Johnson appointed me to the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit in 1968, I was the second woman in the
history of the United States ever to be appointed to a Federal ap-
pellate court. The honor of being the first went to Florence Allen,
and the President who appointed her was Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt in 1934. When she was appointed, she was then a justice of
the Supreme Court of Ohio, a position to which she was elected by
the women who had worked with her to obtain passage and ratifi-
cation of the amendment to the U.S. Constitution permitting
women to vote. Judge Allen had died before I was appointed, and
it was to be many years before another woman was to have that
honor.
  I resigned from the bench in 1979 when President Carter asked
me to become Secretary of Education of the United States. The
U.S. Supreme Court, however, has been a matter of intense schol-
arly scrutiny and more than slight interest to me during my entire
professional life.
  The Court has been called upon, as each of you are aware, to in-
terpret and apply the Constitution under circumstances of more
than 200 years of history. That great charter of government is also
the Nation's great charter of freedom in the Bill of Rights. The Su-
preme Court has been repeatedly required to decide the issues that
most deeply divide our citizens one from the other, invoking that
great Bill of Rights. Those rights include not only the right to wor-
ship as one pleases, to own property, to have the right to petition
for grievances, but also the right to equal protection of the laws,
                                      388
no matter what may be the color of skin or previous condition of
servitude, our Nation of origin, our race, our ethnicity, or our gen-
der.

  When the membership of the Supreme Court has been equal to
that awesome task, the results have been great. When the member-
ship of the Court sometimes has not, the results have been tragic.
No one here needs to be reminded of the impact of the tragic deci-
sion of the Dred Scott case when that Court could not face the chal-
lenge of human slavery under the Constitution of the United
States. But when the majority of the Court has had depth of under-
standing to interpret the Constitution to meet the vast needs of
this country, the results have been not only fine, but ofttimes bril-
liant.

  The Warren Court knew that this Nation could not long endure
with legalized apartheid any more than it could have endured half
slave and half free. The Warren Court, after that decision and im-
mediately before it, created decision after decision which made it
possible to start stripping away the elements and remnants of slav-
ery and the change of bigotry that affected black men.

  Unfortunately, the Court was much slower to recognize that the
only persons subject to invidious discrimination were not limited to
black men. That discrimination was affecting adversely half the
population of the United States--women.

  Even the gifted group of colonial gentlemen who drafted the Con-
stitution were unable to escape the dictates of custom, the dicta of
St. Paul, and centuries of dominance by men that had systemati-
cally reduced women to second-class citizenship.

  Until nearly the end of the 19th century, women were denied the
basic rights of citizenship. Not one of them could vote. With trivial
exceptions, women could not own property, or even their own
wages. Single women were slightly better off, however, than were
their married sisters because, under the eyes of the law, when a
woman married the personalities of the husband and wife merged,
and the wife's disappeared altogether.

  Women who were married were classified by the law as were in-
fants and idiots. The traditional excuse for that blatant discrimina-
tion was expressed by Justice Bradley in a deservedly famous, or
perhaps infamous, opinion to which Senator Feinstein adverted
during her commentary earlier. Every member will recall that the
issue was whether Myra Bradwell had had her privileges and im-
munities rights under the Constitution violated by the law of the
State of Illinois, which refused to permit her entrance into the
practice of law. And Justice Bradley explained in his special con-
curring opinion the reason why, explaining that that sex was not
entitled to the privileges and immunities granted to males. He
said, "The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs
to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of
civil life * * *. The paramount destiny and mission of women is to
fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the
law of the Creator."

  Now, Justice Bradley knew perfectly well that tens of thousands
of women were performing hard physical labor under conditions
anything but dainty. And he also knew that other thousands of pio-
neer women were fighting side by side with their husbands under
                                      389

conditions that were downright perilous. Then why in the world did
he say that? Because he had persuaded himself that God, not man,
had prescribed women's roles, and those who did not follow those
assignments were either biological curiosities or victims of
humankind's inexcusable rebellion against God's will. Justice Brad-
ley and those who shared his views confused the signs of a domi-
nant culture with the signs of the Creator, and he mistook the laws
of man for the laws of nature.

  It took decades of struggle for suffragettes, like Florence Allen,
and the men who could be enlisted into their cause to amend the
Constitution to give women even the right to vote. It took decades
of more work for the Supreme Court of the United States to realize
that women, as well as men, were entitled to equal protection of
the laws.

  As late as 1948, Justice Frankfurter, bless him, wrote the major-
ity opinion upholding a State statute that forbade women to obtain
licenses as bartenders unless the women were wives or daughters
of the male owner of the establishment. To uphold the statutory
classification, Justice Frankfurter harked back to Shakespeare's
ribald ale wife and stated that the 14th amendment "did not tear
history up by the roots." And then he said, re-echoing much of
what Justice Bradley's sentiment had earlier revealed,

  The fact that women may now have achieved the virtues that men have long
claimed as their prerogatives and now indulge in the vices that men have long prac-
tices, does not preclude the States from drawing a sharp line between the sexes
* * *. [T]he oversight assured through ownership of a bar by a barmaid's husband
or father minimizes hazards that may confront a barmaid without such protecting
oversight * * *. [W]e cannot give ear to the suggestion that the real impulse behind
this legislation was the unchivalrous desire of male bartenders to try to monopolize
the calling.

  A majority of men perhaps in this country may have applauded
that decision, but the women did not. Like every campaign that has
been successful in constitutional law, there has to have been an ar-
chitect. One of the major architects to change the Supreme Court's
collective mind about the place of women in the Constitution of the
United States is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Then Professor Ginsburg
knew very well, and she still remembers extremely well, that in
constitutional adjudication the Supreme Court does not make
major progress in miles, but in millimeters.

  The particular case that was chosen for making her points in
constitutional law, like so many others that have seemed to be triv-
ial, was the case called Reed v. Reed.And what was the issue? The
question was the constitutionality of a State law which granted
automatic preference to men over women when both were equally
qualified to administer decedents' estates. She argued that that law
giving mandatory preference to men over women without any re-
gard to their individual qualifications violated the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment.

  Now, in making that argument, Ms. Ginsburg was after larger
constitutional game than the right of women to administer dead
men's estates. The point she succeeded in establishing was that the
statutory classification based on sex, like that based on race, is con-
stitutionally suspect, thereby requiring strict scrutiny. The result is
that a statute cannot be upheld constitutionally merely on that
basis that a legislature could have had some rational reason for en-
                                      390

acting it. And that was the standard that Mr. Justice Frankfurter
adverted to in the case I earlier described, along with the tradi-
tional deference paid to any legislation that bans liquor.

  The importance of the principle decided in Reed became apparent
to less sophisticated scholars in the Frontierocase where the ques-
tion was the validity of a Federal statute which gave special privi-
leges and perks to servicemen with respect to their wives, but de-
nied exactly those perks to servicewomen.

  Writing for the majority of the Court, Justice Brennan relied
heavily on Reed's holding and observed that the Nation's unfortu-
nate history of sex discrimination had been rationalized on bases
of "romantic paternalism." And he said, and I quote, "the practical
effect put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage."

  She won that case, and with it she succeeded in building the
equal protection platform upon which not only she, but many oth-
ers, representing both men and women, were able to establish gen-
der as a subject of deep concern under the equal protection clause.

  Long before I knew Judge Bader Ginsburg personally, I had ad-
mired her work very much as a legal scholar and as an extraor-
dinarily able constitutional advocate. Since she has been appointed
U.S. circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg has performed her judicial role as successfully as she did
her earlier roles--as a professor, as a scholar, as a constitutional
advocate. She has been obliged to follow the law as laid down by
the U.S. Supreme Court whether she agreed with it or not, and she
has faithfully done so.

  Her judicial writings, like her briefs and also like her scholarly
writings as a professor, are concise, tightly reasoned, and persua-
sive. She has also proved herself to be a healer of rifts that always
exist in any close structure such as the judiciary. She is an excel-
lent negotiator. She is a moderator who has, nevertheless, managed
to maintain her intellectual integrity and her dedication to her
ideals of equality for all Americans under the law.

  Perhaps it would not unduly disturb Justice Bradley's ghost to
know that she well performs, very well performs the only roles he
would have permitted her to have: As wife, mother, and as loyal,
marvelous friend.

  This committee has had very few nominees come before it who
begin to have the qualities of distinction that Ruth Bader Ginsburg
has. She deserves your votes for swift confirmation. Her appoint-
ment is a credit to the President. Her swift confirmation will be a
credit to you, and as Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, she will be a credit to the Nation.

  Thank you.

                          PREPARED STATEMENT OF SHIRLEY M. HUFSTEDLER

  My name is Shirley M. Hufstedler. I was admitted to the Bar 43 years ago. Half
of my professional life has been devoted to private law practice and half to public
service. I was a judge on state and federal courts, trail and appellate. When Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson appointed me United States Circuit Judge for the United
States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit in 1968, I became the second woman
in the history of the United States to be appointed to a federal appellate court.

  The first was Florence Allen who was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1934. At the time
of her appointment she was a Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, a position to
                         391

which she had been elected by the woman of Ohio who had worked with her to ob-
tain ratification of the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote.
Judge Allen had died when I was appointed, and thereafter it was many years be-
fore another woman was appointed to the federal appellate bench.

I resigned from the bench in 1979 when the Senate confirmed President Jimmy
Carter's nomination of me as the Nation's first Secretary of Education. When I re-
turned to private life in 1981, I became a partner in the law firm in which I con-
tinue to practice, Hufstedler, Kaus & Ettinger, with time out to teach as Phleger
Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and to lecture in other universities and
colleges throughout the United States and abroad.

The United States Supreme Court has the awesome task of interpreting and ap-
plying the United States Constitution. That great charter of our government is also,
in the Bill of Rights, our great charter of freedom. The Supreme Court has been
repeatedly been called upon to interpret the Bill of Rights in deciding the issues
that most deeply divide our Nation. Those issues include not only the rights to
speak, to follow our own religions, to vote, to own property, to enjoy privacy, but
also the right to equal protection of the law no matter what may be the colors of
our skins, our previous condition of servitude, our race, our ethnicity, or our gender.

When the membership of the Supreme Court has proved unequal to their task,
the results have been tragic. We remember the Dred Scott case in which the Court's
failure to resolve the issue of Black slavery was one of the causes of the country's
tearing itself apart in the Civil War. When the majority of the Justices in the 1930's
were unable to accommodate their Nineteenth Century views of the Constitution to
the urgent demands of the country, the majority imperiled the Court itself.

When the Justices have been equal to their task, the Court has succeeded admira-
bly--often brilliantly. Thus, the Warren Court decided that the Nation could no
more long endure with legalized apartheid than it could with human slavery. The
Court unanimously decided Brown v. Board of Education to strike down racial seg-
regation in the public schools. The Warren Court produced decision after decision
carefully dismantling the remnants of slavery and diminishing invidious discrimina-
tion against Black men.

The Court was much slower to recognize that invidious discrimination was not
limited to Black men, but extended to all women. Even that gifted group of Colonial
gentlemen who drafted the noble words of the Constitution were unable to escape
the dictates of custom, the dicta of St. Paul, and centuries of dominance by men that
had systematically locked women into second class citizenship. Although human
slavery was recognized, women were conspicuously missing in the Constitution.

Until nearly the end of the Nineteenth Century, women were denied basic rights
of citizenship. None could vote. With trivial exceptions, they could not own or dis-
pose of their property, even their own wages. Single women were slightly better off
than their married sisters because, in the eyes oT the law, the personalities of the
husband and wife merged on marriage, and the wife's disappeared.

The traditional excuse for that blatant discrimination was expressed by Justice
Bradley in his famous concurring opinion in Bradwell v. Illinois in which a majority
of the Supreme Court held that, in barring Ms. Bradwell from admission to practice
law, the State of Illinois did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the
Constitution.1 Justice Bradley explained: "The natural and proper timidity and deli-
cacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations
of civil life. * * * The paramount destiny and mission     of a  owfotmheenCraeraetotor."f2ulfill  the
noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the   law

Justice Bradley knew perfectly well that tens of thousands of women were per-
forming hard physical labor and that frontier women worked side by side with their
husbands under grueling and often perilous circumstances. He nevertheless per-
suaded himself that God, not man, had prescribed womens' destinies, and those who
did not follow their assignments were either biological curiosities or the victims of
humankind's inexcusable rebellion against God's will. Justice Bradley and those
who shared his views confused the signs of a dominant culture with the signs of
the Creator, and he mistook man's laws for the laws of nature.

It took decades of struggle by the suffragettes, like Florence Allen, and the men
who would be enlisted in the cause, to amend the Constitution to give women the
right to vote. It took decades of more work before the Supreme Court would realize
that women, as well as men, were entitled the equal protection of the laws.
As late as 1948, Justice Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion upholding a state
statute forbidding a woman to obtain a license as a bartender unless she was "the
wife or daughter of the male owner" of the establishment, To uphold the statutory

classification, Frankfurter harked back to Shakespeare's sprightly and ribald ale
wife and stated that the Fourteenth Amendment did not tear history up by the
roots." He then reechoed Justice Bradley^ sentiments: "The fact that women may
now have achieved the virtues that men have long claimed as their prerogatives and
now indulge in vices that men have long practiced, does not preclude the States
from drawing a sharp line between the sexes. * * * [T]he oversight assured through
ownership of a bar by a barmaid's husband or fattier minimizes hazards that may
confront a barmaid without such protection oversight. * * * [W]e cannot give ear
to the suggestion that the real impulse behind this legislation was an unchivalrous
desire of male bartenders to try to monopolize the calling."3

  A majority of men undoubtedly applauded, but women did not. One of the major
architects of the campaign that changed the Supreme Court's collective mind about
women is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Like every sophisticated constitutional advocate,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg knew that Supreme Court's constitutional interpretations,
with very rare exceptions, move forward by millimeters, not miles.

  The particular case that the Supreme Court chooses for each nudge may at first
seem almost trivial. The case that Ms. Ginsburg argued, Reed v. Reed,4 was just
such a case. The issue was the constitutionality of a state statute providing that,
when two individuals are otherwise equally entitled to appointment as an adminis-
trator of a decedent's estate, the male applicant must be preferred to the female.
She argued that the statutes giving mandatory preference to men over women with-
out regard to their individual qualifications violated the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.

  In making that argument, Ms. Ginsburg was after larger constitutional game
than the right of women to administer decedents' estates. The point she succeeded
in establishing was that statutory classifications based on sex, like those based on
race, were constitutionally suspect, thereby requiring strict scrutiny. The result is
that a statute cannot be upheld constitutionally merely on the basis that the legisla-
ture could have had some rational basis for creating it--the standard invoked by
Justice Frankfurter in the women bartenders' case.

  The importance of the principle decided in Reed became apparent to less sophisti-
cated lawyers when she won Frontiero v. Richardson in 1973.5 In that case, the
question was the validity of a federal statute that gave servicemen the right to
claim medical and other benefits on behalf of their wives who were dependents, but
denied the same rights to servicewomen on behalf of their husbands.

  Writing for the majority of the Court, Justice Brennan relied heavily on Reed's
holding that classification based on sex are inherently suspect and must be sub-
jected to close judicial scrutiny. Justice Brennan observed that the Nation's unfortu-
nate history of sex discrimination "was rationalized by an attitude of 'romantic pa-
ternalism' which, in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage."
Citing Justice Bradley's opinion as an example of such stereotypical notions, he con-
cluded that "statutory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidi-
ously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard
to the actual capabilities of its individual members." 6

  After she had successfully built the equal protection platform for women, she was
able to argue case after case dismantling the legal cages in which women had been
so long enclosed.7 Other advocates used the same platform to carry on her work in
extirpating gender discrimination.

   Long before I knew Ruth Bader Ginsburg personally, I admired her work as a
legal scholar and as an outstanding constitutional advocate.

  When those qualities came to the attention of President Carter, she was ap-
pointed United States Circuit Judge for the Untied States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. She has performed her judicial role as successfully as
she did her earlier roles as a professor of law and a constitutional advocate. As a
Circuit Judge, she is required to follow the law as laid down by a majority of the
Supreme Court, whether she agrees with it or not. She has done so. Her opinions
have nevertheless expressed her conspicuous concern for civil rights for all Ameri-
cans. Like her scholarly writings as a law teacher and her briefs as an advocate,
her judicial opinions are concise, tightly reasoned, and persuasive. She has also

proved herself to be a healer of rifts among judges, as excellent negotiator, and a
judicial moderate who has nonetheless maintained her intellectual integrity and her
dedication to the ideals of equality before the law for all our people.

  Perhaps it would not disturb the shade of Justice Bradley too much to know that
Judge Ginsburg has also admirably fulfilled the only roles he would have permitted
her to play: She is a devoted wife and mother and a treasured friend of all those
who have come to know her.

  This Committee has had few nominees for appointment as Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States who as richly deserve your votes for swift con-
firmation. Her appointment is a credit to the President. Her confirmation will be
a credit to you, and she will be a credit to the Nation as Justice Ginsburg.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge.
  Mr. Millstein.

                      STATEMENT OF IRA M. MILLSTEIN

  Mr. MILLSTEIN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I submitted a state-
ment which I hope will be incorporated in the record, and I will try
to be brief.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be.
  Mr. MILLSTEIN. I have known Ruth and Martin Ginsburg since
the summer of 1957 when Martin joined our firm as a summer as-
sociate. We were then about 20 lawyers located on 42nd Street in
New York. And we are now about 650 in the same city, and in
about nine different locations.
  I have been their friend since 1957, even though we lost Marty
as our partner in 1980, when Ruth came down to become a circuit
court judge--a moment I remember as sort of bittersweet: sweet in
being able to help her on that task, and a real loss to the firm in
losing one of the very best tax lawyers in the United States when
Martin's geography caused him to separate from the firm.
  Ruth Ginsburg's moderate views on the interstitial role of the ju-
diciary and the need for collegiality on the appellate benches has
been demonstrated well in the last few days, and I don't intend to
replicate or duplicate. You don't need to hear any more from me
on that subject.
  I think something else of importance is happening for the bench
and the bar, and I don't think we ought to let that moment pass
without comment.
  Having chosen as a candidate a lawyer/judge from a pool, a very
small pool of very highly qualified people, I would like to think that
President Clinton and soon you in the Senate have chosen with
gender-blindness a person whojust happens to be a woman. If per-
haps that is an overstatement this time, maybe it won't be the next
time.
   I have practiced law now for about 45 years, and I have watched
the bench and the bar become populated with women, but ever so
slowly and with a great deal of room for improvement.
  Martin, Ruth, my wife Diane, also a professional woman, and I
were friends when our children were small in the 1960's and
1970's. We saw each other and our children quite often. I watched
with growing concern over the unfairness and indignities which
were met by both of them, Ruth and Diane, and by the women law-
yers whom we had begun to hire in our firm.
  In those years, a person with Ruth's qualifications should have
been fought over and sought for by law firms on graduation. It
didn't happen. She should have had no trouble securing tenure on
                                      394
a faculty like Harvard, Yale, or Columbia, and that didn't happen
either. And it is no wonder that in the 1970's Ruth turned her
quality mind to gender issues under the Constitution of the United
States and began to focus the whole profession's conscience on
what we had been ignoring for such a long time.

  The legal profession had not been great in making room for
women and racial minorities. It is getting better, but we are not
there yet.

  Now, how does our profession overcome this? Only by training
and learning ourselves, sensitizing ourselves to the need to deal
with gender and race in a diverse workplace, and then actually
making progress.

  Now, the workplace for most of us is our partnership and the
courtrooms. We lawyers normally behave ourselves in courtrooms,
and sometimes we take that good behavior with us out of the court-
room. When it becomes commonplace for us to appear before highly
qualified, diverse judges, gender and racial distinctions in our law
firms will disappear further, especially as it becomes obvious, as it
is here today, that a highly qualified person is being chosen who
just happens to be a woman, not because she is a woman. Happily,
this is becoming easier for most of us now because there are pools
of highly qualified lawyers of diversity, so the choosing can be gen-
der-blind. And maybe today, in Ruth, marks a beginning of gender-
blindness for both the bench and the bar.

  Senator Hatch deserves a very honorable mention in this respect,
which I would like to talk about for just a minute. When President
Carter nominated Ruth to the District of Columbia Circuit toward
the end of his 4-year term, it seemed to us as though the appoint-
ment would languish until after the November 1980 election. In
that event, the likelihood of Ruth's confirmation, we now know,
would have been slim or none. Opposition to Ruth was largely
based on the assertion that she was a single-issue lawyer--wom-
en's rights.

  I knew Senator Hatch from some prior dealings; I have forgotten
now about what, Senator. I personally knew him to be open-mind-
ed. We didn't often agree on substance, but I was always treated
courteously, and he heard me out.

  I called the Senator and asked for an audience for Ruth, urging
him to listen and make up his mind on the evidence, not on gossip
and rumor. He agreed. We three met somewhere for lunch and
talked for quite some time. I don't even remember the total sub-
stance.

  When we were done, the Senator apparently concluded that Ruth
Ginsburg was, indeed, a legal scholar from no ideological school,
who quite certainly had some strong ideas on the laws relating to
gender. But Ruth Ginsburg also demonstrated that she clearly had
the makings of a judge before whom lawyers of all ideologies and
persuasions would like to appear and have cases decided. The oppo-
sition thereafter seemed to have melted away.

  And Ruth was confirmed and on her way to today. Senator Hatch
and I recently reminisced about that day, as two proud colleagues.
Coming as we do from our respective political philosophies, this is
true diversity in action.
                                      395

  So, to repeat and conclude, the candidate is well qualified, excep-
tionally well qualified. That the candidate is a woman truly is inci-
dental. When she is confirmed, President Clinton and the Senate
will have taken a large step in demonstrating that gender should
be and is irrelevant. The eminently well-qualified Justice O'Connor
was the first woman on the Court. There had to be a first. There
always has to be a first. But now, hopefully, we may be over
"firsts," and into quality without regard to gender. To me it is a
major event for the bar and the country. And I think we ought to
pause for just one moment and acknowledge it.

  Thank you.
  [The prepared statement of Mr. Millstein follows:]

                                PREPARED STATEMENT OF IRA M. MILLSTEIN

   I've known Ruth and Martin Ginsburg since the summer of 1957 when Martin
joined our firm as a summer associate. We were then about 20 lawyers--all male--
in smallish quarters on 42nd Street in New York City; we are now 650-plus lawyers
in about nine geographic locations, at last count. I've been their friend throughout,
even though we lost Marty as our partner in 1980 when Ruth became a Judge on
the District of Columbia Circuit Court--a moment I recall with some bitter-sweet-
ness. Sweetness at Ruth's appointment, her confirmation, and at being able to assist
Ruth in that process; disappointment at losing from my firm the best tax lawyer
in the United States, when they moved to Washington, away from our home base
in New York City.

   You've heard, and this morning no doubt will continue to hear, from Supreme
Court scholars and practitioners about Ruth's talents and potential for being one of
the great, not just good, Supreme Court Justices; surely you don't need still another
exegesis on that subject. What may not have been emphasized enough is what I
(and others such as Stanford Law School's outstanding Constitutional Scholar--Pro-
fessor Gerald Gunther who is here today) perceive to Be her greatest qualification--
her non-ideological scholarship. She will be a Justice who applies the law carefully,
analytically and with integrity in a clear and lean manner. She will not, however,
operate in a vacuum, but, because she is who she is and has been, she will be ever
mindful of the world she lives in and the men and women who inhabit it.

   One recent decision, Roosevelt v. DuPont, 958 F.2d 416 (D.C. Cir. 1992), exempli-
fies my view of her judicial approach about as well as any decision of her's that I've
read. It's meaningful to me because it deals with my practice area--business-related
issues.

   There, Judge Ginsburg flexibly entertained an issue first raised on appeal--be-
cause the Supreme Court had earlier suggested that appellate courts not by-pass,
on technicalities, "issues of importance to the administration of federal law." She
concluded that in "exceptional circumstances" Courts of Appeal "are not rigidly lim-
ited" solely to issues raised below. Moving to the merits of an important proxy issue,
her reasoning followed a model process of clarity and precision. Dealing with a fed-
eral statute--she first looked to Congressional intent, and found a delegation of au-
thority to the SEC, with very modest guidance from Congress as to how that dele-
gated authority should be exercised. She next turned to the SEC action at issue to
see if it coincided with Congress' intent. She obviously considered relevant judicial
precedents, and importantly looked to expectations built upon a rather consistent
interpretation of the law. Again, showing regard for not wasting litigator and judi-
cial time with remands, she accepted a public statement of facts not strictly within
the record below, but necessary to the outcome. Her decision was widely ac-
claimed--but, to me, the key was her flexibility, the scope of her inquiry and reason-
ing, and the concise nature of an opinion that said a great deal in a very short com-
pass. You are dealing with a quiet person who possesses a legal mind of enormous
scope, who recognizes the role of the Judiciary as one branch of government that,
while working with co-equal branches, must be ever mindful of individual rights.
And, by now, you must know that.

   Her moderate views on the interstitial role of the Judiciary, and the need for
collegiality on the Appellate Benches, are nowhere better stated than in her own
"Madison Lecture" of March 9, 1993.

   So, let's pass her obvious talents and non-ideological--rather ideal--approach to
judicial decision-making. You have in Judge Ginsburg a Judge--and soon I hope a
Justice--who practitioners would conclude will not only give them a fair shake, but
                                         396

will do so with care and erudition. One can't ask for more from any Bench, or for
any less from the Country's most important Bench.

  But something even more important may be happening, and we shouldn't let the
moment pass without comment. Having chosen as a candidate a lawyer/judge from
a small pool of the very best quality available, I would like to think that President
Clinton, and soon you and the Senate, have chosen, with gender-blindness, a person
who happens to be a woman. If perhaps that is an overstatement this time, the day
will soon come when it won't be.

  Practicing now for almost 45 years I've watched the Bench and Bar become popu-
lated with women, but ever so slowly, and with a good deal of room for improve-
ment. I serve with Cy Vance and others on a New York City Bar Association Com-
mittee on Diversity, which is a nice way of describing a Committee that is asking
ourselves how we're doing with gender and race. The answer is: we're trying--but
probably not hard enough--and there are ways we can improve.

  Judge Ginsburg and my wife (also a professional woman) are among the reasons
for my concern about diversity. Through both, and though the women who have be-
come my partners at my firm, I've seen the indignities and unfairness which still
exist; less than Ruth and my wife Diane grew up with--but far more than should
still exist.

  Marty, Ruth, Diane and I were friends when our children were small in the 60's
and 70's. We saw each other and each other's children often. But then we all became
busy on respective career paths in the 80's and 90's, and geography intervened.
When we talk though--it's as if no time at all has passed.

  In those early years, a person with Ruth's qualifications should have been fought
over and sought by the law firms upon her graduation. It didn't happen. She should
have had no trouble securing tenure on a Harvard, Yale or Columbia faculty. It
didn't happen. I remember Marty's frustration and anger when Ruth was turned
down for a professorship at a law school where we all thought we could help. I'm
convinced that the only issue was gender on the faculty; and gender was still an
issue in law partnerships around the country. It is no wonder that in the 70's Ruth
Ginsburg turned her quality mind to gender issues under the United States Con-
stitution and focused the profession's conscience on an issue the majority had been
ignoring. The profession wasn't great in making room for women and racial minori-
ties. I recall early on inviting a woman associate--our firm's first--to accompany me
to a Bar Association lecture and reception--and being roundly ribbed and jabbed for
doing so. I was embarrassed for us all. It's not so great--even now. I witnessed, just
within the year, a small example. One of my women partners and I met a male who
welcomed me warmly, and then invited us into his office--turning to my partner
and saying, "C'mon honey, this way." I'm sure, it was said without thought or to
denigrate, but nonetheless it was indicative of an attitude that hasn't died easily
in our profession. My partner didn't flinch.

  How does our profession overcome this? Only by training ourselves actively, and
sensitizing ourselves to dealing with gender and race in a diverse workplace.

  But actually making progress is even more important. And gender and racial di-
versity in our workplace becoming commonplace, is the single most important proof
of progress in our profession. The workplaces for most of us are our partnerships,
and the courtrooms. We lawyers normally behave ourselves in courtrooms, and
sometimes take our good behavior with us out of the courtroom. When it becomes
commonplace to appear before diverse judges, gender and racial distinctions will
disppear further. The Bar's task is to make diversity acceptable and commonplace
in our firms; the Executive and Legislative Branches should do likewise for the Ju-
diciary- Happily, this is now becoming much easier for all of us. None of us can hide
behind the old shibboleth that said: show me a dedicated and qualified woman and
she'll make partner (or Judge, or Commissioner, or whatever). Of course, for years
we defined "dedicated and qualified" to exclude 99 percent of those who applied.
After a long struggle however, definitions have been clarified and there are now
pools of highly qualified lawyers of diversity--so that choosing can be gender blind--
and perhaps this day (and Ruth) should mark a beginning of gender blindness--for
both the Bench and the Bar.

  Senator Hatch deserves a very honorable mention in this process. When President
Carter nominated Ruth to the D.C. Circuit towards the end of his four year term,
it seemed as though the appointment would languish until after the election of No-
vember 1980. In that event, the likelihood of Ruth's confirmation, we now know,
would have been slim to none. Opposition to Ruth was largely based on the asser-
tion that she was a single issue lawyer--"women's rights".

  I knew Senator Hatch from some prior dealings, the substance of which I now for-
get. But, of all the Republicans on this Committee, I thought I had the best relation-
ship with him. I, personally, knew him to be open-minded. We didn't often agree
                                             397

on substance--but I was always treated courteously and he heard me out. I called
the Senator and asked for an audience for Ruth--urging him to just listen and make
up his mind on the evidence--not gossip and rumor. He agreed. We three met some-
where for lunch and then talked for quite some time. The talk ranged over cabbages
and kings and lawyers and judges, and I can't recall specifically.

  When we were done, the Senator apparently concluded that Ruth Ginsburg was
a legal scholar from no ideological school--who indeed had strong ideas on the law
relating to gender issues. As she recently pointed out to this Committee, her gender
work in the 70's was toward * * * "the advancement of equal opportunity and re-
sponsibility for women and men in all fields of human endeavor." Ruth Ginsburg
also demonstrated that she clearly had the makings of a judge before whom lawyers
of all ideologies and persuasions would like to appear and have cases decided. The
opposition melted away.

  And Ruth was confirmed and on her way to today. Senator Hatch and I recently
reminisced about that day, as two proud colleagues. Coming, as we do, from our re-
spective political philosophies--that is true diversity in action.

  So to repeat and conclude: This candidate is qualified--exceptionally qualified.
That the candidate is a woman truly is incidental. When she is confirmed--Presi-
dent Clinton and the Senate will have taken a large step in demonstrating that gen-
der should be, and is, irrelevant. The eminently well-qualified Justice O'Connor was
the first woman on the Court--there had to be a first--there always has to be a
first. But now, hopefully, we may be over "firsts" and into quality without any re-
gard to gender. It's a major event for the Bar and the Country. Let's pause for one
moment and acknowledge it.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I thank you all. Your
words were eloquent. They obviously speak for themselves. I have
no questions.

  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. I just want to welcome all of you here and thank
you all for appearing. I think you made very good statements that
everybody should be listening to.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Feinstein.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Just a small observation. As one who has
usually in my prior life seen lawyers through the lens of an individ-
ual case, it is wonderful to see the breadth and the macro picture
of the law. And I think it would lead every American to have a very
great respect for the law. So I want to very sincerely thank you for
coming, particularly Judge Hufstedler, whom I know. And I think
we are going to see the glass ceiling shattered, and I must say I
concur with your views 100 percent.
  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you all.
  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, since I am the only one that ob-
served the 5 minutes, if I [laughter].
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, Mr. Millstein observed the 5 minutes. Mr.
Smith was close, and the judge, because she is a judge, is not
bound by any rules. [Laughter.]
  Judge HUFSTEDLER. Thank you.
  Mr. COLEMAN. I just want to add my thanks to this committee
that you would spend the three or four days airing this, although
I am pretty sure after the first day everybody felt that in this case
the nomination would be reported favorably. I think you have
greatly educated the American people as to what the law is about,
what this country is about, and how responsible politicians and
judges try to meet the demands of the American people. And I
thank you very much for taking the time and effort and providing
the brains and brilliance in the way you conducted yourself.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Nice com-
ment. I thank you all.

  Senator HATCH. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Our third panel is comprised of two very promi-
nent members of the legal academic community. I might add that
we could have had 150 members of the legal academic community
who were willing and anxious to come and testify. But there was
such unanimity that we responded to two in particular. The first
is Prof. Gerald Gunther, the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of
Law at Stanford Law School. Professor Gunther served as a law
clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren, and prior to his appointment
at Stanford was a member of the faculty at Columbia University
School of Law. Welcome, Professor. It is nice to have you back. And
thank you, I might add parenthetically, for always being available
to this committee for any information we ask and any input we
have asked of you.
  Next we have Henna Hill Kay, who is a dean of the University
of California at Berkeley, Boalt Hall, School of Law. It is nice to
see you again, Dean. Again, I thank you, every time I have asked
for your input, you have provided it. She is a coauthor with the
nominee of a casebook on sex-based discrimination and was among
the first full-time women law professors in this country.
  I welcome you both, and I will yield to you in the order you have
been recognized.

PANEL CONSISTING OF GERALD GUNTHER, WILLIAM NELSON
  CROMWELL PROFESSOR OF LAW, STANFORD UNIVERSITY,
  STANFORD, CA; AND HERMA HILL KAY, DEAN, SCHOOL OF
  LAW, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, CA

                 STATEMENT OF GERALD GUNTHER
  Mr. GUNTHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the com-
mittee; that is, Senator Feinstein, my own Senator, a Stanford
alumna, our last, most recent commencement speaker. I am really
personally overjoyed and proud as well as professionally heartened
that this committee is considering the nomination of Ruth Bader
Ginsburg for a seat on the Supreme Court.
  I speak as a teacher of constitutional law for more than 35 years,
and as someone who has known Ruth Ginsburg well for almost as
long a time. I am entirely confident that she possesses all of the
qualities you should cherish in a Supreme Court Justice.
  Ruth Ginsburg was my student at Columbia Law School. She
was a brilliant student. She demonstrated extraordinary intellec-
tual capacities, as she has in everything she has undertaken all her
life. In the 1950's, I set up a program at Columbia to place our
graduates as judicial law clerks, and I assisted her selection by a
fine, originally recalcitrant, Federal judge.
  I have followed her work closely in the years since. I admired her
scholarly capacity as a faculty member at Rutgers and then at Co-
lumbia, and especially her historic work on behalf of women's
rights, as a brief-writer and oral advocate before the Supreme
Court.
  In 1980, Ruth was named, as you know, to the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit. I was asked then to speak at
                                      399
her investiture ceremony and to speak about the task of judges. I
had just begun work on a biography of one of our greatest Federal
judges, Judge Learned Hand. In my address before the District of
Columbia Circuit, I understandably spoke about Hand and com-
pared Ruth Ginsburg's potential talents to his.

  Although I do not claim a great track record in predicting any-
thing--football, soccer, elections, you name it--I have taken special
delight in the fact that my expectations about Ruth were entirely,
and to me not surprisingly, fulfilled. I said then that I knew Ruth
to be modest, thoughtful, penetrating, fair and open-minded, and I
suggested that those qualities equipped her ideally for the bench.

   I also said that she has the character and temperament, the per-
sistence, the sense of responsibility, the modesty as well as the
courage and strength reflected in Learned Hand's words and deeds.
I read her opinions on the court of appeals for the last 13 years
with great interest as they were handed down, and she disclosed
precisely those qualities.

  Ruth Ginsburg, I am convinced, possesses the ingredients, the
moral qualities Hand thought essential for greatness. And I am
confident she will confirm that greatness on the Supreme Court.
She clearly possesses the requisite intellect, temperament, and
character. Her opinions reflect an obvious belief in and fidelity to
the law, careful attention to the records before her, and an appro-
priate respect for the force of precedent. She has demonstrated in-
tegrity and analytical skills. She is also characteristically sympa-
thetic to the fact that the disputes before her involved human
beings and that a court's rulings have an impact on those human
beings. One would expect no less in a person who is herself a splen-
did human being, who has managed to integrate with great skill
her roles as lawyer and teacher and judge as well as wife and
mother, and who overcame the many obstacles that confronted her
and other women who were entering the profession in the 1950's.

  You have an opportunity to recommend the confirmation of an
individual who will be a great Justice, a person who will contribute
immensely to the collegiality, the intellectual quality, and the wis-
dom of the Supreme Court of the United States.

   Now, I fully expect to criticize Justice Ginsburg's opinions on the
Court. After all, that is my professional task. I am confident, how-
ever, I will never have reason to doubt her integrity, her judicial
temperament, and her analytical abilities. I know that I, like most
of my fellow academics, look forward to evaluating the work of a
Supreme Court with Ruth Ginsburg on it.

   I have tried to summarize my remarks. I have submitted a
longer statement for the record.

   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, your entire written remarks
will be placed in the record. It is hard to see how they could im-
prove upon what you have said.

  Mr. GUNTHER. Well, I did actually include a copy, as a matter of
ultimate egomania, of the speech I delivered before the D.C. Cir-
cuit, because I well remember, Senator, the reaction at the recep-
tion afterwards when everyone I talked to winked at me when I
tried to compare Ruth Ginsburg to the qualities of Learned Hand,
and they said, "Nice job. But, of course, she is not going to turn
                                                  400

out that." I have never been happier about being right on some-
thing in my life.

  [The prepared statement of Mr. Gunther follows:]

                                PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERALD GUNTHER

  I am personally overjoyed and proud as well as professionally heartened that this
committee is considering the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a seat on the
Supreme Court.

  I speak as a teacher of constitutional law for more than thirty-five years, and as
someone who has known Ruth Ginsburg well for almost as long a time. I am con-
fident that she possesses all of the qualities you should cherish in a Justice.

  Ruth Ginsburg was my student at Columbia Law School. She was a brilliant stu-
dent; she demonstrated extraordinary intellectual capacities, as she has in every-
thing she has undertaken throughout her life. In the 1950's, I set up Columbia's
program for placing graduates as judicial law clerks, and I assisted her selection by
a fine federal trial judge. I have followed her work closely in the years since; I ad-
mired her scholarly capacity as a faculty member at Rutgers and then at Columbia,
and especially her work on behalf of women's rights, as a brief-writer and oral advo-
cate before the Supreme Court.

  As a teacher of constitutional law and the author of a casebook in my field, I am
very familiar with her central, indeed historic, role in shaping the modern law of
gender discrimination. To this day, I--and, I suspect, most teachers in my field--
speak admiringly of her singular contribution.

  In 1980, Ruth Ginsburg was named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit. I was asked to speak at her investiture ceremony. I had just
begun work on a biography of one of our greatest federal judges, Learned Hand (a
biography that will be published in a few months). In my address before the D.C.
Circuit, I understandably spoke about Hand and compared Ruth Ginsburg's poten-
tial talents with those of my subject. (I am taking the liberty of attaching my 1980
address as an appendix to this statement.) Although I do not claim a great track
record in predictions, I have taken special delight in the fact that my expectations
about Ruth Ginsburg were fulfilled. I said then that I knew Ruth to be "modest,
thoughtful, penetrating, fair and open-minded," and I suggested that these qualities
equipped her ideally for the bench. I also said that "she has the character and tem-
perament, the persistence, * * * the sense of responsibility, the modesty as well as
the courage and strength reflected in Learned Hand's words and deeds." Hand's
greatness, in my view, stems from a special combination of character and tempera-
ment and intellect that, in combination, produces the capacity to be a "modest but
creative judge" who "is heedful of limitations stemming from the judge's own com-
petence and [from] the presuppositions of our constitutional system." I read her
opinions on the Court of Appeals for the last thirteen years with great interest as
they were handed down, and she disclosed precisely those qualities.

  In my close attention to Ruth's career over the years, especially her judicial ca-
reer, some of Hand's words often come to mind as aptly describing Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. Hand once said that the prime condition of great judging is a "capacity for
detachment." He went on to say: "There are those who insist that detachment is an
illusion; that our conclusions, when their bases are sifted, always reveal a passional
foundation. Even so; though they be throughout the creatures of past emotional ex-
perience, it does not follow that that experience can never predispose us to impar-
tiality. A bias against bias may be as likely a result of some buried crisis, as any
other bias." A great judge, he also said, acts "with patience, courage, insight, self-
effacement, understanding, imagination and learning."

  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I am convinced, possesses the ingredients, the "moral"
qualities, Hand thought essential for greatness. I am confident that she will confirm
that greatness on the Supreme Court. She clearly possesses the requisite intellect,
temperament, and character. Her opinions reflect an obvious belief in and fidelity
to the law, careful attention to the records before her, and an appropriate respect
for the force of precedent. She has demonstrated integrity and analytical skills. She
is also characteristically sympathetic to the fact that the disputes before her involve
human beings and that a court's rulings have an impact upon those human beings.
One would expect no less in a person who is herself a splendid human being, who
has managed to integrate with great skill her roles as lawyer and teacher and judge
as well as wife and mother, and who overcame the many obstacles that confronted
women when she entered the profession.

  You have an opportunity to confirm an individual who will be a great Justice, a
person who will contribute immensely to the collegiality, intellectual quality, and
wisdom of the Court.

  I fully expect to criticize Justice Ginsburg's opinions on the Court--after all, that
is my professional task. I am confident, however, I will never have reason to doubt
her integrity, her judicial temperament, and her analytical abilities. I know that I,
like many of my fellow academics, look forward to evaluating the work of a court
with Ruth Bader Ginsburg on it.

  The CHAIRMAN. Dean Kay.

                      STATEMENT OF HERMA HILL KAY

  Ms. KAY. Thank you, Chairman Biden. I want to say before I
start that I do not yield to my colleague, Professor Gunther, in his
admiration for our Senator from California, Senator Feinstein. It is
a pleasure to see her here today on this committee.

  It gives me great pleasure to be here and to participate in your
deliberations as you prepare to recommend to the Senate the ad-
vice it should give to President Clinton on his nomination of Judge
Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  President Clinton's choice of Judge Ginsburg is wise and in-
spired, sound and practical. In Judge Ginsburg, President Clinton
has found a constitutional scholar who knows from her own experi-
ence what it means to be excluded despite outstanding credentials
solely because of sex. In the early 1970's, she brought that experi-
ence--and her flawless logic--to the bar of the U.S. Supreme
Court, where she will soon take her seat. In case after case, she
hammered home the point that for the law to assign preexisting
roles to men and women is limiting to both sexes and is forbidden
by the equal protection clause.

  It is a point that, 20 years later, many regard as self-evident.
But the High Court seemed unable to grasp that point prior to
Judge Ginsburg's advocacy, instead taking as its starting position
the belief that a legislative distinction drawn on the basis of sex
was a rational classification that passed constitutional muster.

  Ruth Bader Ginsburg's strategy of written and oral advocacy to
help the nine men then sitting on the Supreme Court understand
the irrationality of sex-based classification was one of patient in-
struction. She chose cases, as Judge Hufstedler said, in which the
law's unequal treatment of men and women was evident and the
consequent need for a broader interpretation of the equal protec-
tion clause could be clearly established and readily accepted. The
result is that her cases are now constitutional classics: Reed v.
Reed, 1971: A mother can administer a deceased child's estate as
capably as a father. Frontiero v. Richardson, 1973: A service-
woman's Air Force pay earns the same fringe benefits for her de-
pendent spouse that a serviceman's pay provides for his. Wein-
berger v. Wiesenfeld,1975: A widowed father is entitled to the same
insurance benefits available to a widowed mother to help him care
for his infant son after his wife's death. Califano v. Goldfarb, 1977:
A deceased wife's earned income provides the same survivor's bene-
fits to her widowed husband that a deceased husband's widow
would receive.

  These are some of the legal propositions that Judge Ginsburg es-
tablished as an advocate, and she used them to help the Court
forge a new understanding of the equal protection of the laws. It
                                                   402

was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's voice, raised in oral argument before
the U.S. Supreme Court, that opened new opportunities for the
women of this country. She was in the forefront of the creation of
the legal precedents that advocates who have followed her have
used, time and time again, to build a strong edifice against dis-
crimination that now protects many groups. She left her enduring
mark on the Constitution even before taking her place on the Su-
preme Court.

  I speak today not only as an academic observer of Judge Gins-
burg's works, but also as her co-author and friend. I have had the
privilege of working with her on our casebook on "Sex-Based Dis-
crimination," published in 1974. She and I are both among the first
20 full-time women law professors in the country. We continue to
serve together on the Council of the American Law Institute. From
those vantage points, I can say that hers is a courageous intellect,
and that she is as steadfast and loyal a colleague and friend as
anyone could wish. Her standards are exacting. She produces the
best and most precise work, and she expects the same from others.

  As this confirmation process has shown the Nation, she thinks
deeply and chooses her words with care. But I can tell you that her
compassion is as deep as her mind is brilliant. In Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, the President has offered the country a Justice worthy of the
title. I urge this committee to recommend that the Senate give its
enthusiastic consent to her appointment to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                             PREPARED STATEMENT OF HERMA HILL KAY

  Senator Biden, Members of the Judiciary Committee, it gives me great pleasure
to be here and participate in your deliberations as you prepare to recommend to the
Senate the advice it should give President Clinton on his nomination of Judge Ruth
Bader Ginsburg to the United States Supreme Court.

  President Clinton's choice of Judge Ginsburg is wise and inspired, sound and

In Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the President has offered the country a Justice worthy of
the title. I urge this Committee to recommend that the Senate give its enthusiastic
consent to her appointment to the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Dean.
  I have been in the Senate 20 years, and I have sat through a lot
of nomination hearings for the court generally, and the Supreme
Court in particular. I must say I have never heard higher praise
for a nominee than I have heard from those who have testified
today. I thank you for adding your insight to these deliberations.
And your reputations individually precede you, and it means a
great deal that you think so highly of this nominee, and it rein-
forces in my mind, and the minds of the committee as a whole, that
our initial judgment about Judge Ginsburg was correct, and that
the wisdom of the President was demonstrated in his choice. But
I thank you both. I have no questions.
  I will yield to my friend from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. Well, we are happy to welcome both of you here,
and we appreciate the excellent testimony you have given. I had to
listen to a degree while I was meeting with some people in the
back room here, but I don't know that Judge Ginsburg could have
had two better law professors come in and speak for her and on
her behalf.
  Don't you forget, Professor Gunther, when that book on the judge
comes out, Learned Hand
  Mr. GUNTHER. Will you make clear, Senator, that we don't have
an agreement? That gives me the opening to say it will be pub-
lished in February 1994 by Knopf.
  Senator HATCH. He is going to publish a wonderful book on
Learned Hand. February of 1994, you say?

   Mr. GUNTHER. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. Knopf. I expect an autographed copy, is all I can
say.

  Mr. GUNTHER. It is yours.
  Senator HATCH. I appreciate it, and we are happy to have both
of you here. Thank you for coming.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Feinstein?
  Senator FEINSTEIN. Nothing other than to say, Mr. Chairman,
you have before you, as you well know, two of
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon.
                                                    404

  Senator FEINSTEIN. I was addressing my comments to you. You
have two of California's finest representatives, I think, from two of
the greatest universities in the world. And my observation would
be, after sitting through these hearings, Dean Kay and Professor
Gunther, that if Mrs. Ginsburg were of another religion, she might
even be canonized at the end of this.

  The CHAIRMAN. I imagine we will work that out before it is over.
[Laughter.]

  I thank you both, and thank you for taking the time to make the
trip. We appreciate it.

  The CHAIRMAN. We are going to move out of order here a little
bit because the next panel was under the impression, understand-
ably, that we were going to break for lunch. But it is not my inten-
tion to break for lunch, and they are presently in the cafeteria on
their way back. But our fifth panel is a panel comprised of a former
law clerk, former client, and former ACLU colleague of Judge Gins-
burg.

  Edith Roberts was a law clerk to Judge Ginsburg from 1989 to
1990, and she is presently a staff attorney at the Environmental
Law Institute.

  I understand Stephen Wiesenfeld is the litigant Judge Ginsburg
represented in the landmark gender discrimination case, and he is
not here. We will add him to the sixth panel.

  Kathleen Peratis was a colleague of Judge Ginsburg while she
was head of the American Civil Liberties Union, Women's Rights
Project, during the 1970's. Today she is a lawyer in private practice
in New York City.

  I welcome you both and invite you, starting with you, Ms. Rob-
erts, to give your testimony within 5 minutes, if you would, please.

       PANEL CONSISTING OF EDITH LAMPSON ROBERTS,
  WASHINGTON, DC, AND KATHLEEN PERATIS, NEW YORK, NY

             STATEMENT OF EDITH LAMPSON ROBERTS

  Ms. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, it
is an honor for me to be here today to speak in support of the nom-
ination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court of the
United States. I have had the privilege of knowing Judge Ginsburg
in a variety of contexts. She has been my employer, when I served
as her law clerk from 1989 to 1990; my mentor, discussing career
choices with me after my clerkship ended; my friend, holding a sur-
prise wedding shower for me at her apartment; and the officiator
at my marriage to another of her clerks, my husband Matt.

  In all these roles, Judge Ginsburg's influence and example have
been an inspiration. As her law clerk, I was granted a close-up
view of the way Judge Ginsburg approaches her work on the bench.
Her thorough knowledge of the letter of the law is matched only
by her deep respect for its spirit. Even in the District of Columbia
Circuit, with its high proportion of administrative law cases that
some might characterize as abstruse and unexciting, Judge Gins-
burg comes to each case with fresh enthusiasm, interest, and a
commitment to reaching the result the law requires. This commit-
ment manifests itself in her extraordinarily thorough and careful
work habits. Long after her clerks have departed each night, and
                                             405

despite persistent phone calls from a husband requesting her pres-
ence at the dinner table, Judge Ginsburg stays in her chambers
reading the briefs and pondering the arguments in every case. The
precision of the reasoning by which she arrives at a decision is re-
flected in the conciseness and clarity of her opinions, written and
edited with an exact sense of when something is "just right."

  This is not the deliberation of an ivory-tower perfectionist. Judge
Ginsburg's devotion to reaching the right conclusion, and to ex-
plaining it in the clearest possible manner, stems from her keen
awareness of the importance of the judge's role in our society.
Every day judges make decisions that have real-world effects on in-
dividuals and groups. Such decisions cannot be made casually, but
require careful and thorough consideration. Judge Ginsburg's sen-
sitivity to those real-world effects has led her to take her law clerks
on a tour of Lorton Reformatory on several occasions in order to see
a side of the criminal justice system that cannot be conveyed in
legal citations or through oral argument.

  The precision that marks Judge Ginsburg's approach to judging
also reflects her appreciation of the delicate balance by which order
is maintained in our system of government. Preserving that bal-
ance--between the various branches of government as well as with-
in the judiciary itself, between trial and appellate courts--demands
a delicate touch. Judge Ginsburg's command of that touch moti-
vates one of the conventions of her opinion writing. Unlike many
appellate court judges, Judge Ginsburg scrupulously avoids refer-
ring to the authors of decisions under review in a District of Co-
lumbia Circuit as "the lower court" or "the court below." Referring
to the "trial court" or the "district court" instead, she instructed us
early in our clerkship, conveys appropriate respect for the crucial
role played by the judiciary's front line.

  All of these hallmarks of Judge Ginsburg's style as a lawyer and
a jurist began to influence my own approach to the work of a law-
yer during my clerkship. Judge Ginsburg taught me not only how
to reason through a case, and to convey the result clearly and con-
cisely, but also how to do so without being divisive or harsh. Her
example demonstrated that persuasion, the lawyer's hallmark, does
not need to be shrill or strident. Calm assurance can win the day
as effectively, and perhaps more enduringly, than grandstanding.

  These lessons learned during my clerkship shaped my own ap-
proach to the practice of law. But it was not until the clerkship had
ended and I entered the professional world, got married, and began
to contemplate raising a family, that I recognized the true force of
Judge Ginsburg's example. Her ability to attain the summit of pro-
fessional accomplishments, while still raising a family and building
a rich and fruitful marriage, make her a prime role model for a
young woman lawyer--or, for that matter, for a young male law-
yer--seeking to reconcile the conflicting demands of career and
family.

  Judge Ginsburg is much more than a role model for professional
women. A role model often leads only by example and remains re-
moved from those who seek to emulate her. One as accomplished
and as disciplined as Judge Ginsburg might easily have climbed as
high as she has, and then have remained content merely to inspire
others by her stature. But Judge Ginsburg was not satisfied with
                                                  406

attaining success for herself and her own family alone. She vowed
to change the system so that others, perhaps less determined than
she or endowed with fewer intellectual gifts, not only could follow
in her path, but could find their own, quite different paths. She
wanted not just to set an example, but to enable others actually to
benefit from what she had achieved, in whatever way they chose.
By succeeding in that effort, Judge Ginsburg has become much
more than a one-dimensional prototype for professional women.
She has helped to engineer changes in our society that enable all
individuals to look beyond static social expectations and to fulfill
their goals and ideals on their own terms. It is this compassionate
commitment to equality without stereotypes that characterizes
Judge Ginsburg as a jurist and as a person.

  I Took forward with confidence and hope to Judge Ginsburg's ac-
cession to the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed, I know that she
will serve as a thoughtful and caring custodian of what is best in
our society for all our children. Thank you.

                       PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDITH LAMPSON ROBERTS I

  Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, it is an honor for me to be here
today to speak in support of the nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the
Supreme Court of the United States. I have had the privilege of knowing Judge
Ginsburg in a variety of contexts. She has been my employer, when I served as her
law clerk from 1989 to 1990, my mentor, discussing career choices with me after
my clerkship ended, my friend, holding a surprise wedding shower for me at her
apartment, and the officiator at my marriage to another of her clerks, my husband
Matt.

  In all these roles, Judge Ginsburg's influence and example have been an inspira-
tion. As her law clerk, I was granted a close-up view of the way in which Judge
Ginsburg approaches her work on the bench. Her thorough knowledge of the letter
of the law is matched only by her deep respect for its spirit. Even in the D.C. Cir-
cuit, with its high proportion of administrative law cases that some might character-
ize as abstruse and unexciting, Judge Ginsburg comes to each case with fresh en-
thusiasm, interest, and a commitment to reaching the result the law requires. This
commitment manifests itself in her extraordinarily thorough and careful work hab-
its. Long after her clerks have departed each night, and despite persistent phone
calls from a husband requesting her presence at the dinner table, Judge Ginsburg
stays in her chambers reading the briefs and pondering the arguments in every
case. The precision of the reasoning by which she arrives at a decision is reflected
in the conciseness and clarity of her opinions, written and edited with an exact
sense of when something is "just right."

  This is not the deliberation of an ivory tower perfectionist. Judge Ginsburg's devo-
tion to reaching the right conclusion, and to explaining it in the clearest possible
manner, stems from her keen awareness of the importance of the judge's role in our
society. Every day, judges make decisions that have real-world effects on individuals
and groups. Such decisions cannot be made casually, but require careful and thor-
ough consideration. Judge Ginsburg's sensitivity to those real-world effects has led
her to take her law clerks on a tour of Lorton Reformatory on several occasions in
order to see a side of the criminal justice system that cannot be conveyed in legal
citations or through oral argument.

  The precision that marks Judge Ginsburg's approach to judging also reflects her
appreciation of the delicate balance by which order is maintained in our system of
government. Preserving that balance--between the various branches of government
as well as within the judiciary itself, between trial and appellate courts---demands
a delicate touch. Judge Ginsburg's command of that touch motivates one of the con-
ventions of her opinion-writing. Unlike many appellate court judges, Judge Gins-
burg scrupulously avoids referring to the authors of decisions under review in the
D.C. Circuit as "the lower court" or "the court below." Referring to the "trial court"

or the "district court" instead, she instructed us early in our clerkship, conveys ap-
propriate respect for the crucial role played by the judiciary's front line.

  All these hallmarks of Judge Ginsburg's style as a lawyer and a jurist--her con-
scientiousness, her capacious memory for prior cases and precedents, her ability to
cut to the quick of a case and identify the pivotal issues--began to influence my
own approach to the work of a lawyer during my clerkship. Judge Ginsburg taught
me not only how to reason through a case, and to convey the result clearly and con-
cisely, but also how to do so without being divisive or harsh. Her example dem-
onstrated that persuasion, the lawyer's hallmark, does not need to be shrill or stri-
dent. Calm assurance can win the day as effectively, and perhaps more enduringly,
than grandstanding.

  These lessons learned during my clerkship shaped my own approach to the prac-
tice of law. But it was not until the clerkship had ended, and I entered the profes-
sional world, got married, and began to contemplate raising a family, that I recog-
nized the true force of Judge Ginsburg's example. Her ability to attain the summit
of professional accomplishments, while still raising a family and building a rich and
fruitful marriage, make her a prime role model for a young woman lawyer--or, for
that matter, for a young male lawyer--seeking to reconcile the conflicting demands
of career and family.

  Judge Ginsburg is much more than a role model for professional women. A role
model often leads only by example, and remains removed from those who seek to
emulate her. One as accomplished and as disciplined as Judge Ginsburg might eas-
ily have climbed as high as she has, and then have remained content merely to in-
spire others by her stature. But Judge Ginsburg was not satisfied with attaining
success for herself and her own family alone. She vowed to change the system so
that others, perhaps less determined or endowed with fewer intellectual gifts, not
only could follow in her path, but could find their own, quite different paths. She

fessional women. She has helped to engineer changes in our society that enable all
individuals to look beyond static social expectations and to fulfill their goals and
ideals on their own terms. It is this compassionate commitment to equality without
stereotypes that characterizes Judge Ginsburg as a jurist and as a person.

   I look forward with confidence and hope to Judge Ginsburg's accession to the Su-
preme Court. If she is confirmed, I know that she will serve as a thoughtful and
caring custodian of what is best in our society for the benefit of all our children.
Thank you.

                              BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF EDITH LAMPSON ROBERTS

   Edith Lampson Roberts received her law degree in 1989 from Harvard Law
School, where she was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. From 1989 to 1990,
she worked as a law clerk to Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After her clerkship, she practiced law for
two years as a litigation associate at the Washington, D.C. law firm of Miller,
Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin. She is now a staff attorney at the Environmental Law
Institute, a non-partisan, non-profit center for research and education in the field
of environmental law.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well done.
  Ms. Peratis.

                 STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN PERATIS
  Ms. PERATIS. I would like to begin by differing with what some
of the earlier speakers have said. I don't think that Ruth Bader
Ginsburg should be thought of as someone who has been chosen
just because she is the best and her sex, her gender, is irrelevant.
I think it is very relevant. I think it is crucial. I think that having
another woman in the Supreme Court is central to the importance
of what is going on today. I think we had a graphic example yester-
day of how crucial it is that there is an African-American in Con-
gress. I think that Senator Moseley-Braun's race is not irrelevant,
and I think that Judge Ginsburg's sex is not irrelevant.

  I have worked with Judge Ginsburg, or I did work with her
through most of the seventies. I met her in 1973, and she hired me
a few months later to succeed her at the ACLU. So I had the great
privilege of watching this grand strategy unfold and working at her
side and at her feet for a good part of it.

  She was not only all the wonderful things that you have heard,
creating this entire area of gender discrimination law under the
Constitution, but she shaped a whole generation of women lawyers.
There were dozens and dozens and scores of women who worked
with her, and worked with her very closely, and were infected by
her vision of social justice.

  What we have seen in the last week is a very careful judge who
takes her responsibilities seriously, who knows the law in its
breadth and depth as well as anybody in the country, and perhaps
more than most. But what we saw at the ACLU was a grand strat-
egy for revolutionizing the constitutional law of this country.

  I think that she has a broad vision of social justice. She has a
broad and expansive notion of using the law as a tool of achieving
social justice.

  When she was at the ACLU and when she was teaching at Co-
lumbia and-running the ACLU Women's Rights Project, her vision
of social justice was instructive to all of us. People were amazed at
how accessible Judge Ginsburg was during those years. She was al-
ways reachable by women lawyers who were trying to figure out
what we ought to do next, and she not only chose her own cases
with care, but she had a broad range of control over all the sex dis-
crimination litigation that took place in the seventies. She stopped
cases that should have been stopped. She encouraged cases that
should have been encouraged. And she counseled us on which case
was which. And we took her instruction very seriously, and when
we failed to follow her advice and pursued a case that she coun-
seled against, we usually lost because she knew, as she knows as
a judge, that you have to take one step at a time and not ask
judges to go too far too fast. Because if you do, you may lose what
you might have won.

  I think that her litigation strategy as an advocate will be re-
flected in her vision as a Justice on the Supreme Court. I think she
has a vision, and I think that her constraint as an appellate judge
is an indication of how she follows the rules. As a litigator, she fol-
lowed the rules by never citing a case for something it didn't stand
for, by being extremely careful, and by being reliable. And she has
been careful and reliable as a court of appeals judge.

  Her nomination to the Supreme Court I think fulfills her destiny.
I have believed, since 1974 at least, that she would end up on the
Supreme Court. I think there is a whole generation of women who
are now, as I am, women of a certain age who were young lawyers
in the early seventies, who believed that she would end up on the
Supreme Court. She has said that she didn't think about it. We
thought about it. We believed it.

  My first daughter was born in 1977, and I named her after Ruth
Ginsburg. I told her, my daughter, that she was named after the
woman who would be the first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court.
When Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed in 1981

  The CHAIRMAN. She thought her name was Sandra?

  Ms. PERATIS. My daughter said, "Mom, what's the deal here? You
told me that Ruth was first on the Supreme Court." I had to give
her a little political lecture.

  But the fact that Ruth has now been nominated and apparently
will be confirmed is a fulfilling of her destiny and the fulfillment
of a dream of a whole generation of women lawyers for whom her
gender is not irrelevant. Her gender is central and crucial, and we
are all proud. We are proud, and as you can see in a lot of respects,
Ruth is humble. She has done her work carefully and with dedica-
tion for many years, and I think that will continue. And as a Su-
preme Court Justice, I believe she will walk humbly and do justice
for the rest of her life.

  Thank you.
  [The prepared statement of Ms. Peratis follows:]

                               PREPARED STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN PERATIS

  I am Kathleen Peratis. I am a lawyer in private practice in New York City. I am
here as a friend and colleague of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I am also here as a rep-
resentative of the thousands of women lawyers, judges and law students and women
who aspire to be lawyers, judges and law students who Ruth has inspired and for
whom she has served as a role model over the last 25 years.

  I met Ruth in 1973 at a national conference of feminist lawyers held in New York
City. There were, at that time, no more than several dozen of us in the whole coun-
try. I had graduated from law school four years earlier, and in my class of about
150, there had been 6 women.

  Although our numbers were few, and although our task, justice for women, was
monumental, we knew that our time was nearly come. We knew this for a number
of reasons, but chief among them was that we were led by Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

   In 1971, Ruth had won a case in the United States Supreme Court, Reed v. Reed,
in which for the first time in our history, a discriminatory gender classification was
declared unconstitutional. When that happened, we had been heartened, inspired
and suddenly overcome with the notion that justice was possible.

  And so, when I actually met Ruth in 1973, it was like meeting Joan of Arc. She
offered me a job a few months later, to succeed her at the ACLU when she became
a full time law professor at Columbia Law School. Thus began five of the most excit-
ing and professionally rewarding years of my life, although she was full time at Co-
lumbia, she was also full time at the ACLU. I watched her, the foremost women's
rights lawyer in the country, implement her constitutional strategy for undoing 200
years (or more, depending upon your perspective), of entrenched gender discrimina-
tion. She did it case by case, and she won every one--except the one she knew
should never have gone to the Supreme Court in the first place, but was unable to
stop. More of that in a moment.

   Ruth's overarching principle was equality. Her fundamental commitment was to
the proposition that gender classification, even those that purported to be benign,
always hurt women and usually hurt men. Her faith was abiding that men were
by and large people of good will, and that if the harmfulness of gender classification
were rationally and carefully explained to them, they would understand and re-
spond by working with us to undo the injustice, piece by piece.

   Her litigation strategy called for identifying gender classifications that embodied
stereotypical notions of women which were harmful both to the non-stereotypical
woman and also to her spouse. That is the common denominator of Frontiero,
Weisenfeld, Struck, Moritz and a host of others. Kahn, the only one she lost, does
not fit that pattern, and she knew it. She never wanted that case to go to the Su-
preme Court, and tried very hard, albeit unsuccessfully, to stop it. She thought it
was a loser, and she was right. It seemed to benefit certain women and hurt none.
The invidiousness was too subtle and the Court didn't understand.

  As her strategy was unfolding, Ruth became a mentor and a role model for a
whole generation of feminist lawyers who, like me, are now women of a certain age.
She not only inspired us with her success, she was present on a day to day basis
to help us. People were always amazed at how easy it was to get in touch with
Ruth. She was almost always by the phone either at Columbia or at home, and she
always had time to talk about a problem or issue, to review a brief, and make com-
ments and suggestions, or to meet with groups of women to discuss policy or strat-
egy. She was always very clear that our work had to advance us toward one goal--
                                             410

equality. Thus, any argument or strategy that required an assumption that women
were better than men, or that implied that mere equality was not enough, provoked
a steely stare. She would then remind us that the gender classification we endorse
today will be precedent for the gender classification that puts us or keeps us in our
place tomorrow. Today's pedestal is tomorrow's cage.

  Her litigation strategy in the '70's turned out to be a good fit for her later judicial
philosophy of the '80's. She insisted then that we attempt to develop the law one
step at a time. Present the Court with the next logical step, she urged us, and then
the next and then the next. Don't ask them to go too far too fast, or you'll lose what
you might have won. She often said "It's not time for that case." We usually followed
her advice and when we didn't, we invariably lost.

  It's no wonder my colleagues and I, Ruth's acolytes by the score, assumed from
quite early on, certainly by the mid 1970's, that Ruth would be the first woman on
the Supreme Court. When my first daughter was born in 1977, and I named her
after Ruth, I told my daughter that her namesake would be the first woman on the
Supreme Court. When Justice O'Connor was appointed, in 1981,1 had some explain-
ing to do.

  Ruth has not only been role model and colleague, she has been a friend. She has
shared my joys with me and allowed me to share some of hers with her. She is gen-
erous with her time and affection, and devoted to her family and friends. She is ac-
cessible, patient and almost wholly without what is negatively described as ego. She
is, in short, at least off the bench, thoroughly non-judgmental.

  As I know her, Ruth is an overpowering intellect and a dear and compassionate
friend. Because of these qualities of mind and spirit, my belief is that as a Supreme
Court Justice, she will, as she has for her entire professional life, walk humbly and
pursue justice.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Well said.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you very much for appearing.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Feinstein, do you have any questions?
  Senator FEINSTEIN. I have no question.
  You are free to go. Thank you very much.
  Senator HATCH. Senator Cohen?
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon. I'm sorry. Senator Cohen?
  Senator COHEN. NO questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all very much.
  Now we will go back to our fourth panel. Our next panel is com-
prised of representatives of a number of groups wishing to testify
in opposition to the nomination of Judge Ginsburg.
  The first is Paige Comstock Cunningham, who is president of the
Americans United for Life, in Chicago, IL. Next is Rosa Cumare,
a partner in the firm of Hamilton & Cumare, Pasadena, CA. We
also have with us Nellie Gray, who is the president of the March
for Life Education and Defense Fund, and has been a welcome tes-
tifier at a number of hearings. This is not her first time to testify
at this and other hearings, and we welcome her.
  Susan Hirschmann, executive director of the Eagle Forum, in
Washington, DC. Also on this panel is Kay Coles James, vice presi-
dent of the Family Research Council, but I understand she is in the
hearing in the Labor Committee at this time. And last, but cer-
tainly not least, is Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative
Caucus, who is testifying on behalf of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, is
that correct, Howard?
  Mr. PHILLIPS. On behalf of both organizations.
  The CHAIRMAN. On behalf of both organizations.
  I welcome you all, and I would invite your testimony in the order
in which you have been recognized.
  Ms. Cunningham, welcome.

         STATEMENT OF PAIGE COMSTOCK CUNNINGHAM

  Ms. CUNNINGHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Committee, I thank
you for this opportunity to testify on the nomination of Ruth Bader
Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   I am an attorney, a graduate of Northwestern University School
of Law. I am a wife and I am a proud mother of three children.
I think all those things bear on the testimony that I am giving
today, because it is likely that I have reaped in my own career
from the seeds that were sown by Judge Ginsburg in her efforts to
abolish sex discrimination.
  As you mentioned, I am also the president of Americans United
for Life, which is the legal arm for the pro-life movement, and we
are the oldest national pro-life organization in this country. We are
nonpartisan and we are secular, and we are committed to the pro-
tection of the vulnerable and the innocent human life from concep-
tion to natural death.
   Although Judge Ginsburg may possess the credentials to sit on
the Supreme Court, we are concerned about the process by which
she was nominated and her views on abortion, and appreciate this
opportunity to fully educate the Nation, and that is what I appre-
ciate about this process of a thorough look and an opportunity to
speak.
   I am troubled because, in the first time in our history, a Supreme
Court nominee has been required to pass a test, an abortion litmus
test. President Clinton made this very clear before he nominated
Judge Ginsburg to the High Court. This is a litmus test which
prior nominees were wrongly accused of passing, and why one of
them was defeated.
   I think it is a tragedy that supporting an act which ends the life
of one being and scars the future of another should be considered
the supreme test for the Supreme Court. And just as disturbing as
this unprecedented litmus test is Judge Ginsburg's attempt to jus-
tify the decision in Roe v. Wade on the ground that abortion is
somehow necessary for women' sequality, that women cannot be
equal in the law or in society, without abortion, through all 9
months of pregnancy for any reason.
   Outside of abortion, Roe v. Wade has done absolutely nothing to
advance women's rights. State and Federal courts have handed
down dozens of decisions striking down various forms of sex dis-
crimination, and few, if any, of these courts, including the Supreme
Court, have relied on or even mentioned Roe.
   The real advances in women's rights have come not through the
court cases, but through laws enacted by Congress and by State
                                      412
legislatures. These are the laws that have banned sex discrimina-
tion in public and private employment, in the sale and rental of
housing, in education, laws that mandate equal pay for equal work,
to name just a few. Do you know what? Not one of those laws de-
pends on abortion.

  Judge Ginsburg has repeatedly stated that abortion is protected
by the equal protection clause of the Constitution or that that
ought to have been the basis, rather than the due process clause.
But she has gone farther than the Court and suggested in her
writings that there ought to be a public policy supporting taxpayer
funded abortions.

  Her writings also reveal that she would oppose laws protecting
women in crisis pregnancies, laws upheld by the Supreme Court
just a few months ago, last year, laws such as a woman's right to
know, a 24-hour reflection period to think about information about
a decision that she cannot change and that she will live with for
the rest of her life, laws involving parents. These laws received
overwhelming public support. After all, they are reasonable laws.

  Judge Ginsburg has testified before you that abortion is central
to a woman's dignity. But what is this legacy of Roe?Has a genera-
tion of abortion on demand solved any of the problems for which
it was offered? Has abortion reduced the rates of child abuse or il-
legitimacy or teen pregnancy or the feminization of poverty? Has
it enhanced respect for women? After 20 years of abortion on de-
mand, abortion has flunked the test as the miracle cure for the so-
cial problems it promised to solve.

  The only obvious benefit of legalized abortion is the economic
one. A $300 abortion is much cheaper than a $3,000 delivery of a
baby. But what about the cost to women's bodies and women's
lives? Thousands of women now bear the scars of perforated
uteruses, lost fertility and higher breast cancer risks. Close to 70
percent of all relationships end in the first year after an abortion.
Many women are abandoned by the baby's father as soon as the
crisis of pregnancy is solved by abortion.

  Some women say they can't even pass a playground or turn on
a vacuum cleaner, because it sounds like a suction machine. All too
often, they fall into a pattern of self-abuse, that abuse which mir-
rors their abuse by others. The destruction and tragedy caused by
28 million abortions is a gaping national wound, a wound whose
ugliness is covered up by polite tolerance and rhetoric about a
woman's right to choose and keeping government out of private
choices.

  And make no mistake about it, coercion to have abortions is real.
The coercion may be possible precisely because abortion is legal.
That is the unspoken price for progress in our careers. Female
medical residents, in an article in the New England Journal of
Medicine, reported that tragedy. We attorneys have discovered that
same price. And why not? Because if a woman demands that com-
plete autonomy in her abortion decision, it only seems fair that she
bear complete responsibility for the consequences of that, and
women once again are left alone to pay the price.

  Our radical abortion policy, which Judge Ginsburg apparently
supports wholeheartedly, would not expand or advance women's is-
sues. I believe it has actually set the clock back on women's dig-
                                      413
nity, including the dignity of motherhood. Children should be a
shared responsibility. Our educational goals and professional
dreams should not depend on an elective surgery that creates sec-
ond-class citizens out of the voiceless.

  Abortion goes against the core values of feminism, equality, care,
nurturing, compassion and nonviolence. If we women, who have so
recently gained electoral and political voice, do not stand up for the
voiceless and the politically powerless, who will? Those who pro-
mote abortion rights do not represent the women of America. The
1.8 million members of the National Women's Coalition for Life
prove that you can be pro-woman and pro-life. Our feminist pio-
neers, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
cited with approval by Judge Ginsburg, were strongly against abor-
tion and recognized it as child murder and a crying evil.

  Judge Ginsburg wrote that the greatest judges "have been inde-
pendent thinking individuals, with open, but not empty minds, in-
dividuals willing to listen and to learn." Unless there is convincing
evidence that Judge Ginsburg is willing to reexamine her premises
about abortion, which she has so recently stated, then we cannot
withdraw our objection to her confirmation.

  We ask the committee to seriously consider this statement and
our more extensive written testimony. The future of women, men
and generations of many yet unborn depend on it.

  Thank you.

                              PAIGE COMSTOCK CUNNINGHAM, ESQ.
                          PRESIDENT, AMERICANS UNITED FOR LIFE

                                                CONCERNING

        THE NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG TO BE AN ASSOCIATE
               JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                                                INTRODUCTION
        Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, and Members of the Committee,
thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding this
nomination. My name is Paige Comstock Cunningham. I am an
attorney, a graduate of Northwestern University Law School, a
wife, and a proud mother of a girl and two boys. It is likely
that I have reaped some of the benefits, in my professional
career, from the seeds sown by Judge Ginsburg in her efforts to
abolish sex-based discrimination in the law.
         I am also the President of Americans United for Life (AUL),
a national non-profit public interest law firm and educational
organization. Both the staff and board of directors are diverse,
crossing political, philosophical and religious lines. Indeed,
one of AUL's strengths is its nonpartisan, professional and
scholarly approach to issues affecting the protection of human
life.
        Americans United for Life aims to establish, through law and
education, protection of innocent persons from conception to
natural death against abortion, infanticide and euthanasia.
        Although my main area of interest is in state legislation, I
have co-authored several amicus briefs. One of those was filed
on behalf of the American Association of Prolife Obstetricians
and Gynecologists and the American Association of Pro-Life
                                    415

Pediatricians in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, in
1989. In her concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor relied on a
portion of that brief in her discussion of viability.

        The nomination of Judge Ginsburg has evoked much less furor
and outcry than the past three or four Supreme Court nominations.
This may reflect the Committee's unwillingness to repeat past
spectacles, that the majority of the Committee belongs to the
President's party, or that special interest groups who have
launched massive campaigns against previous nominees are silent
because their "ox is not being gored."

         In any case, the purpose of this testimony is to address
certain aspects of Judge Ginsburg's philosophy and approach to
decision making on the Court that may not be fully or fairly
explored. Briefly, those issues are: the proper role of the
judiciary; Judge Ginsburg's views on judging; her views on gender
discrimination; her views on abortion; and the injury to women
caused by legalized elective abortion.

        Judge Ginsburg is well qualified in many ways to serve on
the Supreme Court. Her work as a litigator, advocate, professor,
legal analyst and appellate judge have given her broad
experience. I hesitate to mention her gender, for that is the
very kind of distinction she has worked so tirelessly to
eradicate. And if her presence on the bench is promoted as a
"good thing" for women, or if she is expected to hold some
special regard for "women's rights," then recognition for that
reason alone contradicts her entire record as an advocate for the
Women's Rights Project she established while General Counsel of
the American Civil Liberties Union.

        Judge Ginsburg is frequently described as "moderate." If
that label holds true when she sits on the Supreme Court, then
all of us may be well-served. If she continues ruling carefully,
as she has so often done, we would not expect her to support
radical shifts in constitutional doctrine.

        On the other hand, if Judge Ginsburg brings her personal
                                    416

views as litigator, academic and advocate to a Court whose
rulings are not subject to review, then we have reason to be
concerned. For those views cannot fairly be described as
moderate. She would be likely to urge the Court to take leaps in
constitutional doctrine, leaps that affect issues in which AUL
has a direct interest, such as abortion and euthanasia.

                            I. ABORTION AS THE "LITMUS TEST"
         A troubling aspect of this nomination is its unprecedented
focus on one single issue: abortion. President Clinton's promise
to employ an abortion litmus test is historic. This is the first
Supreme Court nomination in American history in which a personal
commitment to unlimited abortion rights is the "bottom line."
Although Judge Ginsburg has not litigated an abortion rights
case, her support of abortion rights has been made quite clear,
by the President, by her writings, and by her public statements.
Whether or not she was asked the question directly is a
distinction without a difference, since her views are plainly
evident from her own record.
        All other things being equal, this is hardly an appropriate
measure of one's fitness to serve on the Supreme Court. There is
a clear implication that abortion is the "first right." On
behalf of myself and millions of women and families in these
United States, I object to this highly political use of abortion
advocacy as the determining factor for non-representative,
unelected service on the Supreme Court.

              II. JUDGE GINSBURG'S VIEWS ON THE ROLE OF A JUDGE
        In our constitutional scheme, the Framers secured liberty
and controlled the power of the State through a separation of
powers among the three branches of the federal government
executive, legislative, and judicial. It is the people who are
the original source of authority for the Constitution and whether
                                    417

and how it should be amended. Federal judicial power is not
inherent; it is derived from Article III of the Constitution.

        Nor is the Court intended to be a representative body.
Rather than being elected, the Justices are given life tenure
precisely to insulate them from temporary political passions that
rock any nation from time to time in order for them to interpret
faithfully the original design of our government, as modified by
the people through the amendment process provided for in Art. V.

        Yet, Judge Ginsburg implies that she sees the Court as a
representative body and that the Justices do have authority to
change the principles of the Constitution through
interpretation.1 This is seen in her view that the judiciary may
"repair unconstitutional legislation."2 This is also seen in her
implicit belief that the Constitution requires public funding of
abortion and her criticism of the Court's contrary decisions of
the 1970's as "incongruous" and "most unsettling."3 Indeed, her
writings have focused not on the legitimacy of different methods
of constitutional interpretation, but on the strategic and
tactical political advantages that expansive methods of
interpretation might provide.4

                 Judge GinsbuRg's dissent in DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency
for Intern. Dev.. 887 F.2d 275, 277 (D.C. Circuit 1989),
illustrates the inconsistencies in her alleged moderate and
deferential judicial philosophy. It appears that at least in the
case of abortion, Judge Ginsburg may be willing to find new
constitutional doctrine in support of policy goals she favors.

         DKT was a case in which abortion advocates challenged an
executive order prohibiting indirect aid to foreign organizations
which promoted abortion as a method of family planning, and
denied funding to foreign organizations which used private funds
for abortion activities, or which collaborated with organizations
which advocated abortion.5 The majority opinion in DKT upheld
the ban of federal foreign aid funding of organizations that
perform or promote abortion. Judge Ginsburg would have
                                    418

invalidated this restriction. In her dissent, she wrote that
"government may demand only that public funds be segregated by
the grantee so that they are used solely for the specified family
planning services, and not for abortion related activity." DKT,
887 F.2d at 3 00.6 Judge Ginsburg equated the choice not to fund
abortion indirectly with punishing abortion advocates or
providers. DKT. 887 F.2d at 305-306.7

        Two years later, however, the Supreme Court in Rust v.
Sullivan, 111 S.Ct. 1759 (1991), upheld regulations prohibiting
abortion counseling and referral: "no funds appropriated for the
project may be used in programs where abortion is a method of
family planning," and a doctor employed by the project may be
prohibited in the course of his project duties from counseling
abortion or referring for abortion." Rust. Ill S.Ct. at 1772.
The Court explained that the regulation was not a case of
government suppression of ideas, but a prohibition on a project
grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of
its scope. Rust at 1772-1773. Clearly, Judge Ginsburg would
have decided Rust differently, for she wrote in DKT that "it is
now settled" that when government funding is dependent upon the
restriction of activities paid for through private sources, the
government has exacted impermissible penalties on protected
expression.8

         The Rust decision was 5-4, Justice White voting with the
majority to uphold the abortion funding-promoting restriction.
If Judge Ginsburg had been on the Court instead of Justice White,
the vote would have been 4-5, and the funding restriction
invalidated. The critical point here is not the wisdom of
congressional policy regarding the funding of abortion. Such
policies change from time to time as Congress changes and public
sentiments change. That, of course, is the role of the
legislature, and the genius of elective self-government. But
Judge Ginsburg is not a legislator, nor is the Supreme Court an
elected body subject to defeat or recall by the voters at the
                                    419

polls. The disturbing aspect of Judge Ginsburg's dissenting
opinion in DKT is that it shows her readiness to override public
policy set by the politically accountable branches of government,
even to the extreme of overturning public funding decisions which
are far removed from the realm of judicial competence. If this
is what her supporters mean when they say she is a moderate and
not a judicial activist, then they are misstating their case.

        Judge Ginsburg's long-standing believe that poverty is cured
by abortion can be seen in the phrasing of her dissent in DKT.
where she characterizes abortion as both a "facet of
comprehensive world population planing,"9 and also as a
"necessary last resort given current conditions of poverty,
ignorance, physical insecurity, and fear in which many women
live."10 She wryly notes that U.S. policy at that time meant
that "government need not spend public funds on abortion
services; it may, instead, encourage the indigent pregnant woman
to reproduce by paying the full medical costs of childbirth, as
well as child support thereafter (citations omitted)."11 Judge
Ginsburg apparently believes that the government entices poor
women to "reproduce" by offering them assistance in their
difficult circumstances. This suggests a preference for aborting
the children of the poor, rather than seeking other ways to
alleviate suffering.12 "Helping" the poor through abortion may
indicate misguided compassion, or an attitude bordering on
eugenics; in either case, abortion is seen as a positive good,
and its potentially negative effects on individual women are
ignored. In her dissent in DKT. Judge Ginsburg makes reference
to the legal status of abortion in some foreign countries without
addressing the U.S. Government's concern about coerced abortion.
Would Judge Ginsburg support foreign nations forced abortion
policies as a means of controlling world population? Does she
recognize the subtly coercive aspects of U.S. abortion policy in
our own country where the Court has declared, in effect, that an
untimely pregnancy is the personal problem of each individual woman?

              III. JUDGE GINSBURG'S VIEWS ON SEX DISCRIMINATION
                         A. Her "Immoderate" Recommendations

         In April 1977, the United States Civil Rights Commission
issued a Report entitled, "Sex Bias in the United States Code"
("Report"). The "initial research and draft" of the Report was
developed by Judge Ginsburg, then a professor of law at Columbia
Law School, and Brenda Feigen Fasteau, former director of the
ACLU's Women's Rights Project.13 The report which Judge
Ginsburg co-authored "was used as the basis for the Commission
study."14 Although some aspects of the Report have merit,
others raise disturbing questions regarding how Judge Ginsburg
would apply her "equal rights principle" in practice. The Report
clearly illustrates the rigidity and formality of her views on
sex-based distinctions and, unfortunately, a lack of common
sense.

        Although the Report addresses a number of areas of sex-based
distinctions, it did not mention abortion, which, of course, is
not regulated by the U.S. Code. However, other laws which
address the sexual exploitation of women were challenged. In her
unyielding adherence to gender neutrality, Judge Ginsburg would
eradicate laws which protect vulnerable women from coercion and
exploitation by men.

         Completely outside the opinions of mainstream America, the
Report recommends the abolition of statutory rape statutes that
punish men who engage in sexual relations with girls, but not
women who engage in sexual relations with boys, and lowering the
age of consent from 16 to 12.15 Do these recommendations
suggest that Judge Ginsburg would strike down statutory rape
statutes that are intended to protect girls from the sexual
advances of men? or that she would strike down laws that impose
an older age of consent?

        The Report suggests that "[prostitution, as a consensual
act between adults, is arguably within the zone of privacy
protected by recent constitutional decisions."16 The Report
                                     421

recommends "unqualified decriminalization [of prostitution] as
sound policy, implementing equal rights and individual privacy
principles."17 Would Judge Ginsburg would strike down laws
against prostitution?

        Her perceived moderation may be due more to her skill as a
tactician,18 than to a genuine commitment to centrism or
collegiality. In Appellant's Brief in Reed v. Reed, she argued
that gender-based classifications should be treated as "suspect,"
yet in this and subsequent cases, the laws she sought to have
declared unconstitutional were fairly minor and without
significant public support.

                       B. The Consequences of Judge Ginsburg's
                                    Views on Sexual Equality

         It seems clear that, if there is one central purpose that
has guided Judge Ginsburg's career, it is her lifelong
determination to see her view of "sexual equality" written into
American law and she undoubtedly views herself as representing
American women to accomplish this.19 Regrettably, her view of
"sexual equality" is formal, abstract, artificial, and narrow,
based on a resistance to virtually any gender-based distinctions
in the law and a seeming resistance to the survival of
traditional roles for any women. Abstractions predominate and the
practical impact on women is absent from in her vision.

        This is seen in Judge Ginsburg's belief that, under her
sexual equality rationale for Roe v. Wade, the Constitution
compels publicly funded abortion if government provides financial
assistance for childbirth.20 In the abstract world of "sexual
equality," if government provides financial assistance for
childbirth, it must fund abortion. In the real world, prenatal
care and costs for childrearing are many times more than a $250
abortion, and government assistance can only partially offset the
greater cost of childbirth and the pressure toward abortion. It
is a fiscal reality that if the state has to fund abortion
                                     422

whenever it funds childbirth, there are less benefits available
for the substantially greater costs of childbirth. Women with the
greater cost of childbirth lose and the pressure to abort is
compounded.21

         Rigid formalism is also seen in Ginsburg's view that Roe was
justified by the stigma that women faced from unmarried
pregnancy.22 She seems not to have considered that perhaps the
stigma was the social problem that needed to be addressed, not
abortion, or that the stigma might diminish, as in fact it has
over the past 20 years.

         Unlimited abortion rights, including strongly stated views
on population control,23 are clearly part of her view of "sexual
equality."24 As she stated in February, 1981, at a dinner for
the Women's Rights Collective at Georgetown University, "My
optimism rests primarily on social and economic conditions that
appear irreversible, among the most prominent, small family norms
and effective birth control necessary to preserve the planet . . 

        The abstraction and formalism in her view of sexual equality
is seen in her call for an "equal-regard conception of women's
claims to reproductive choice . . . unsteered by government."26
In her view, anti-abortion laws violate a woman's ability "to
participate equally in the economic and social life of the
Nation." She has said that the problem with Roe is that it did
not focus "more precisely on the women's equality dimension" or
that it did not "place[] the woman alone . . . at the center of
its attention."27 This forecloses any public policy, expressing
the will of the people, protecting the life or health of the
unborn child at any time of pregnancy.

        Why can we be so certain of the stark and rigid implications
of Judge Ginsburg's theories about abortion law? First, because
her view that abortion should be viewed under a sexual equality
(or Equal Protection) rationale though never accepted by the
Court has been raised repeatedly by her compatriots in abortion
                                    423

rights litigation to strike down state regulations.28 Second,
the former ACLU attorneys in the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy who have opposed any state regulation of abortion in the
courts for the past 20 years instigated a letter writing for
Judge Ginsburg's nomination to the Supreme Court, stating that
she was their ideal candidate.29 Perhaps they assume that she
will press for abortion rights to be grounded in the Equal
Protection clause.

        Her criticisms of Roe v. Wade have focused on style or
process, not on its outcome.30 Initially, a superficial reading
of that speech raised concern in some quarters that she might not
be sufficiently "committed" to Roe and abortion rights. However,
in the transcript of that speech, she made her commitment to
legalized abortion even clearer and stronger.

         It is helpful to look at the law review article upon which
that speech is based.31 Her chief criticism of the majority
opinion in Roe is that it went too far, too fast. If the Court
had ruled more narrowly, in Ginsburg's view, and simply struck
down the Texas statute in question, it would not have sparked the
adverse popular reaction.32 She believes the right to life
movement might not have been born but for the extremism of Roe/s
holding and reasoning.33 And contrary to popular impression,
her alternative rationale would prohibit the parental notice laws
and informed consent laws that the Court has finally allowed 20
years after Roe v. Wade in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.34

        Yet, her apparent deference to the democratic process is
clearly conditioned on that process achieving the "right"
results. If it does not do so, Judge Ginsburg has insisted that
the judiciary has the power to step in.

         In the case of her functional critique of Roe v. Wade, she
presumed that the democratic process would yield unlimited
abortion rights. When it did not, she advocated greater judicial
intervention. Judge Ginsburg's statements about leaving abortion
to the legislative process are belied by her own opposition to
                                    424

the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding of medicaid
abortions. Although the Hyde Amendment was upheld by the Supreme
Court, and is an example of the democratic process at work,
apparently Judge Ginsburg would override the will of Congress and
require federal abortion funding. She earlier criticized the
Court's 1977 decisions upholding refusal to fund non-therapeutic
abortions and the right of a public hospital to exclude
abortions. She has admitted that courts may need to "legislate a
bit" until the legislature comes up with the result she believes
to be appropriate.

                 IV. ABORTION AND THE REALITY OF WOMEN'S LIVES
         Because women have been not merely the bearers of life, but
also the primary care givers to the young, the old, and the ill,
one would hope to see in Judge Ginsburg's writings a deep respect
for these customary roles of women. However she has displayed a
disappointing lack of respect for women's substantial
contributions within the family.
         That lack of respect is most poignantly revealed in Judge
Ginsburg's advocacy of abortion as necessary for "women's
dignity." The notion that elective abortion is necessary for
women to achieve equal status in American society is profoundly
misguided and wrong. This is part and parcel of the formalistic
and abstract way in which Judge Ginsburg views women's rights. It
is critical to understand the context of abortion rights before
one can clearly see the full impact of abortion on women in
America.
         It is simplistic and misleading to view abortion as merely a
means by which women can alleviate an immediate obstacle to
education or career. From a philosophical and biological
perspective, it ignores the values of nurturance and
connectedness in women that feminism has specifically revered.35
From a practical perspective, it ignores the pressures which push
women toward abortion and away from other alternatives, the
                                    425

freedom that it gives to men to abandon any sexual
responsibility, and the physical and psychological injury to
women that surpasses the transitory relief of quickly alleviating
what appears to be an obstacle.

                 Abortion is Not Necessary for Women's Equality
         Judge Ginsburg's own record demonstrates that
Roe v. Wade is not necessary to secure or preserve equal
opportunity for women in American society. Roe struck down no
practice relevant to women and their educational and career
objectives. In fact, it may have made discrimination against
pregnant women in college and the workplace easier.
         Before and after Roe, the Supreme Court has shown a
sensitivity to sex discrimination claims,36 but there is no
evidence that Roe itself enhanced that sensitivity. No decision
of the Supreme Court on gender-based discrimination relies upon
Roe v. Wade. Roe has been cited in less than a dozen lower court
cases involving sex-discrimination and was dispositive in
none.37
         Under current Supreme Court doctrine, gender-based
discrimination is subject to "heightened scrutiny", an
intermediate standard of review, more rigorous than rational-
basis, less rigorous than strict scrutiny. Under this standard,
classifications based upon gender cannot be sustained under the
Constitution unless they bear a "substantial relationship" to
"important governmental objectives."38 The Court, however, has
not yet said that sex-based classifications must be treated as
race-based classifications. A fair reading of Judge Ginsburg's
writings suggests that she would adopt the "strict scrutiny"
standard of review for laws that discriminate on account of sex.
This position, however, fails to reflect an appreciation of and a
deference to the exclusive means by which the Constitution may be
changed, by an amendment approved by Congress and ratified by
three-fourths of the States. Former Justice Powell recognized
                                     426

this limitation when he refused to adopt, by judicial fiat, the
proposed Equal Rights Amendment.39

        Judge Ginsburg, apparently, would not wait for the people to
decide whether the Constitution should be amended. Her
willingness to adopt such a standard should give pause because of
the rigidity of the strict-scrutiny standard. Moreover, adoption
of such a standard is unnecessary. The principal gains in
achieving equality of rights for women under the law have been
made through the action of legislative bodies, not courts. The
Congress has enacted many laws promoting equality of rights under
the law by forbidding sex discrimination in public and private
employment,40 public works projects,41 unemployment
compensation,42 sale or rental of housing,43 and education,44
and by mandating equal pay.45 Many States have supplemented
this legal structure with their own anti-discrimination laws and
equal rights amendments.46

            IV. ABORTION LAWS AS A TYPE OF "SEX DISCRIMINATION"
               A. Ginsburg's Criticism of the Rationale of Roe;
                             Equal Protection vs. Due Process

         In the previously-discussed Madison Lecture delivered at New
York University in March, 1993, Judge Ginsburg posited a
different approach and rationale for Roe v. Wade. Rather than
premising the abortion right on the right of privacy found in the
due process clause, she would have treated it is an issue of
gender-based discrimination, and grounded the abortion right in
the equal protection clause. This view, that laws regulating or
restricting abortion are sex-discriminatory, is radical. Not all
women think this way, and not even all who call themselves
"feminist" would share her view.

        Judge Ginsburg argues that abortion implicates "a woman's
autonomous charge of her full life course."47 Autonomy
language, of course, is more appropriate for the due
process/right of privacy rationale than equal protection
                                    427

analysis. Nonetheless, this view of the autonomous woman is
startling. To argue that abortion laws are, by definition
discriminatory, avoids any balancing of the interests at stake.
At least with the balancing test, competing interests are taken
into consideration. Inclusion of abortion within equality
principles is contrary to the doctrine itself. For to do so
would require the subordination of others, and other interests.

         Even under Roe, there is a recognition of some of those
competing interests: that of the state in protecting potential
life, which becomes "compelling" at viability; the interest of
parents in their minor daughter's decision about abortion; and
even the child's interest in life itself. Under this equal
protection analysis, there is no competing interest worthy of
constitutional consideration, let alone protection. Thus,
abortion becomes a matter between a woman and her conscience,
with no regard for the father of the child, the grandparents of
the child, society's interest in present and future generations,
or even the developing daughter or son in the womb. The woman's
autonomy would always trump other interests voiced.

         The argument that abortion rights should be premised on
equal protection, rather than due process, grounds, is an
apparent concession that they do not now stand on solid footing,
and that an abortion right is not rooted in the Constitution. It
would be illuminating for the Committee to ascertain whether
Judge Ginsburg believes an Equal Rights Amendment is necessary
for constitutional protection of abortion rights. If it is
neither necessary for, nor relevant to, the abortion question,
then that should be made clear also.

        Apart from judicial considerations, an autonomy/equal
protection approach to the abortion question contradicts many of
the core values of feminism, values which are shared by millions
of American women who do not consider themselves to be feminist.
These are the values of care, nurturance, compassion, non-
violence and inclusion. These values include care for those who
                                     428

are less fortunate, less able to speak for themselves. For many
of us, it requires no great leap to include the preborn child
within the circle of care and protection. Out of the natural
biological connection between the intrauterine child and mother
arises recognition of that dependent relationship which deserves
heightened protection, both in law and in society.

         Judge Ginsburg's lack of appreciation for the traditional
roles of women appears in her statement that some

         feminists argue forcibly (sic) that women, at least as
         childbearers, perform a service for society that nature did
         not equip men to perform, a service essential to the
         survival of the human race, one that should attract special
         recognition and rewards. (People concerned with population
         growth, one might note, have doubts about encouraging such
         service. ) A 8
         Her view of traditional roles may be colored by her apparent
belief that those roles were inferior and that dependency allowed
or encouraged considerable suffering and legal disadvantage for
women.49
         It is possible to recognize the historical problems women
have faced without denigrating traditional roles, or assuming
that only through wholesale restructuring of family life can
women have equal "stature" with men.50 As an advocate for the
ERA Judge Ginsburg argued that the Constitution had excluded
women,51 and that gender cases prior to 1971 demonstrated social
and legal hostility toward women. She supported the "grand" and
general language of the ERA as giving a textual basis for equal
rights for women, which would strip away laws which demeaned
women, but extend genuine protection to all. In fact, Judge
Ginsburg was either telling only part of the story or was just
plain wrong on all points.
        Most of the Constitution deals with the structure of our
government; the bill of rights protecting individuals did not
trump states' rights of legislating matters related to the
                                     429

family, employment and voting, even after the incorporation of
the Civil War Amendments--not really until the last three decades
of this century. To present cases such as Bradwell (1873)
(challenging a law barring women from practicing law) or
Happersett (1873) (challenging state law barring women from
voting) as evidence of the law's inherent devaluation of women is
to misrepresent those cases, which were decided on the basis of
the states' right to set policy in these matters, not on a
fundamental hostility toward women.52 The High Court's attitude
to many gender rights cases prior to the middle of this century
echoes that of the Happersett court: "If the law is wrong, it
ought to be changed; but the power for that is not with us.53
Feminist revisionist readings of cases regarding women's rights
can produce a powerful emotional response from an audience, but
does not encourage careful, thoughtful analysis of our
constitutional principles.

         Seeking to ground rights on Constitutional test is laudable,
but for Judge Ginsburg to insist that the "grand" language of the
ERA is still a workable approach to equity for women requires her
to ignore some social changes of the past two hundred years. At
the time the Constitution was ratified, it was not intended to
embody the whole of our law; state law was taken seriously, and
the family and the church were strong social institutions which
provided a guide for individual and familial behavior. With the
growth of the welfare state, and the increasing reliance on the
Constitution as a guarantor of unenumerated fundamental rights,
the family and church appear to be weaker, and the absolute
language of the amendment could be interpreted in ways that may
not help women.

         Our recent history suggests that while it may be
theoretically possible to envision an ERA that would preserve
genuinely protective laws and expand them to include all persons,
courts more frequently strip away protective laws than extend
them54 because striking down legislation as unconstitutional is
                                    430

clearly within the power of the judiciary, while extending
benefits of the law to persons not included by legislative
mandate edges toward judicial overreaching.

                         B. The Dangers of an Equal Protection
                                Basis for Legalized Abortion

        An equal protection argument would greatly change the cast
of constitutional doctrine for abortion regulation. The equal
protection rationale was considered and rejected by the Supreme
Court, in the recent case of Bray v. Alexandria Women's Clinic.
113 S.Ct. 753 91993). The Court found that protest against
abortion did not reflect a class-based (gender-based) animus
against women.

        An equal protection rationale would also, as noted above,
avoid any consideration of the interests of the unborn child.
This stands in contradiction to developments in virtually every
other area of law pertaining to the unborn child, such as fetal
homicide, prenatal injuries and wrongful death. Twenty-one
States, by statute or court decision, treat the intentional,
knowing, reckless or negligent killing of an unborn child
(outside the context of abortion) as a form of homicide, and
nearly half of these States do so without regard to the stage of
pregnancy when the injury was inflicted or when the death
occurred.55 Virtually all States and the District of Columbia
recognize a common law cause of action for nonfatal, prenatal
injuries.56 No case denying a cause of action for such injuries
has been decided for almost twenty-five years.57 And the
overwhelming majority of jurisdictions (36 States and the
District of Columbia) also recognize a statutory wrongful death
action for prenatal injuries, even where those injuries result in
stillbirth.58

        Under an equal protection rationale, abortion could be
treated as just a form of "post-coital birth control."
Apparently, there is virtually no regulation affecting abortion
                                    431

that would pass constitutional muster, unless of course, it did
not "affect" or "unduly burden" the abortion decision. It is not
at all clear that Judge Ginsburg would defer to the will of the
Congress, most recently expressed in the significant majority
approval of the Hyde Amendment by the House of Representatives.
This measure ensures that taxpayer dollars do not pay for
elective abortions. Would Judge Ginsburg follow precedent or her
own inclinations if faced with a challenge to this appropriations
limitation? Would she uphold laws reguiring physicians to notify
parents before aborting their daughter? What about regulations
reguiring that a woman receive complete and accurate information
prior to undergoing abortion. These are currently constitutional
expressions of public policy.

                             V. The Consequences of Abortion
          Continued legalized abortion will only further injure
women. Abortion has not solved any of the problems for which it
was offered, and its continued legal sanction simply postpones
the day when society will have to grapple with some of the
serious issues affecting women and families. Abortion has not
ameliorated any of these problems: unwed motherhood, teen
pregnancy, child abuse, spouse abuse, or the feminization of
poverty. A cynic might note that the main "problem" abortion
solves, in cold economic terms, is avoiding the cost of having a
baby. It is, of course, much less costly to terminate a
pregnancy by abortion, than to give birth.
         Abortion has negatively affected women's lives in many ways.
Its legality does not guarantee its safety for the woman's life,
physical or psychological well-being.
         There is a growing body of evidence that abortion is a
psychological stressor, and for many women, the psychological
consequences are severe and long-lasting.
         There is also a high social and personal cost for the women
who undergo abortion, particularly if they are unmarried. Eighty
                                    432

percent of all abortions are performed on unmarried women.59 In
such a relationship, the man bears no legal obligation unless the
child survives. By its very nature, such a relationship creates
the greatest potential for coercion, his denial of
responsibility, and abandonment of the woman by her erstwhile
partner when pregnancy results.

        A study by Carol Gilligan, one of the foremost feminist
analysts of women's abortion rights and independent decision-
making, revealed that many of the aborted women she studied did
not make independent, moral choices, but were influenced by the
lack of moral and material support from the men in their lives
for continuing their pregnancies.60

         One survey of women experiencing post-abortion distress
revealed that "more than one-third felt they had been coerced
into their decision."61 That coercion is subtly present in the
work force as well. A study of female medical residents reported
open hostility to pregnant residents from program directors and
colleagues. The rate of abortion among female residents was
three times that of the control group.62

         Similarly, women lawyers are aware of the same subtle bias
against having children. An article in the National Law Journal
noted that law firms have been unable or unwilling to create an
environment supportive of working mothers.63 In another
incident, the New York City Department of Corrections settled a
lawsuit filed by several female officers who had been told to
have abortions; many who refused were given physically grueling
jobs.64

         Pressure to have an abortion is reflected in court cases of
various kinds. For example, men have sued to "enforce" a
contract to undergo an abortion.65

         Abortion certainly has not improved the problem of
relationships between men and women. Abortion does not stabilize
a relationship, whether or not the pregnancy was viewed as a
threat.
                                433

        The most common male response to unwanted pregnancy when it
        occurs outside of marriage has been to "take off," leaving
        the woman to bear the physical, the emotional and, often,
        the financial brunt of either having an abortion or carrying
        the pregnancy to term. Studies of abortion and its
        aftermath reveal that, more often than not, relationships do
        not survive an abortion: the majority of unmarried couples
        break up either before or soon after an abortion.66
Abortion unfortunately isolates women from those who should bear
direct responsibility--fathers of aborted children, and from the
society that ought to support her in her decision to give birth.
        Judge Ginsburg seems to approve of the notion in Casey that:

         people have organized intimate relationships and made
         choices that define their views of themselves and their
         places in society, in reliance on the availability of
         abortion in the even that contraception should fail. The
         ability of women to participate equally in the economic and
         social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their
         ability to control their reproductive lives.67

         The implication that women organize their lives around
"abortion availability" would come as a great surprise to many
women. Abortion is not the defining issue for women. As the
1.8 million members of the National Women's Coalition for Life
agree, it is possible--and right--to be both pro-woman and pro-
life. Even for those women who do not consider themselves "pro-
life," abortion is not a top priority. A New York Times July
1989 poll revealed that most women were more concerned about job
discrimination, child care and balancing work and family than
about abortion.68 More men than women favor abortion rights,
and women tend to be more protecting of unborn human life than
men.69

         The expectation that women rely on elective surgery to
advance a career or continue an education ignores the broader
contexts and issues that shape women's lives. This notion is
inimical to Carol Gilligan's principles of "care, concern,
responsibility and non-violence."70

         Judge Ginsburg's own life and record provide the solution to
the dilemma of women's equality and abortion. She began her
career in challenging distinctions in the law based solely on
                                     434

 gender. Under her influence, many discriminatory laws were
 struck down under the equal protection doctrine. But none of
 these involved abortion. Although Judge Ginsburg would
 incorporate abortion rights into the line of cases based on equal
 protection, this is not necessary to women's full equality and
participation in society. Since no case advancing women's
 opportunity has relied on Roe, abortion is not legally necessary
or relevant for preservation of those gains. Indeed, the
unsightly thread of the abortion doctrine could easily be removed
without unraveling any of the garment.

                                                 CONCLUSION
         This Committee should carefully look at the impact of a
nominee's commitment to abortion rights that supersedes our
traditional understanding of the proper role of the judiciary and
the legislative process, and should carefully weigh what impact
the Court, with Justice Ginsburg, will have on the future of the
women and families of this nation.
        Thank you.

nations, assistance with voluntary family planning. President
Reagan announced the "Mexico City Policy,' which stated in part:

         The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child
         (1959) calls for legal protection for children before birth
         as well as after birth. In keeping with this obligation,
         the United States does not consider abortion an acceptable
         element of family planning programs and will no longer
         contribute to those of which it is a part. Accordingly,
        when dealing with nations which support abortion with funds
         not provided by the United States Government, the United
         States will contribute to such nations through segregated
         accounts which cannot be used for abortion. Moreover, the
        United States will no longer contribute to separate
         nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively
         promote abortion as a method of family planning in other
         nations. DKT. at 277.

51. Judge Ginsburg noted in 1989, that "as framed in 1787, the
Constitution was intended to be a document of governance by and
for an elite--white, propertied adult males, people free from
dependence on others, and therefore considered to be trustworthy
citizens, not susceptible to influence or control by master,
overlords, or supervisors," "Some Reflections on the Feminist

Legal Thought of the 1970's" 1989 U. Chicago Legal Forum 9, 12
(1989) .

52. Judge Ginsburg grudgingly describes the basis for the
decisions in Bradwell v. Illinois. 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130 (1873)
and Minor v. Happersett. 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162 (1874),
explaining that "from the perspective of nineteenth century
jurists, allowing women to contract, control their own earnings,
vote, and hold public office was not fit subject matter for
federal constitutional resolution." "Sex Equality and the
Constitution," 52 Tulane Law Rev. 4 51, 4 53. In fact, the Court
viewed these matters as subject to state, rather than federal
law, but there is no indication that the female plaintiffs, or
women in general were disparaged in these opinions.

53. Happersett 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 177.

54. The Court in Intern. Union. UAW v. Johnson Controls. Ill
S.Ct. 1196 (1991) viewed the moral and ethical concerns of a
battery manufacturer about the potential harm to the offspring of
female employees as a ruse for keeping women out of high-paying
blue-collar jobs. IN a decision sometimes bordering on derisive
in tone, the Court notes that "despite evidence in the record
about the debilitating effect of lead exposure on the male
reproductive system, Johnson Controls is concerned only wit the
harms that may befall the unborn offspring of its female
employees." Johnson at 1203. Rather than extending protection
to the offspring of male employees, however, theCourt concluded
that "decisions about the welfare of future children must be left
to the parents who conceive, bear, support, and raise them rather
than to the employers who hire those parents. Id at 12 07.

55. Nine States define the killing of an unborn child as a form
of homicide, regardless of the stage of pregnancy: Ariz. Rev.
Stat.  13-1103(A)(5) (West 1989) (manslaughter); Cal. Pen. Code,
 187(a) (1988) (murder) (an early decision of the California
Court of Appeals reading a viability requirement into the
statute, People v. Smith. 59 Cal. App.3d 751, 129 Cal.Rptr.
498 (1976), has been rejected recently by another Court of
Appeals decision, see People v. Davis. Cal.App.4th , 19 Cal.
Rptr.2d 94 (1993); 111. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, 5/9-1.2, 5/9-2.1,
5/9-3.2 (1992) (murder, manslaughter); Ind. Code Ann.,  35-42-1-

Ann.,  609.266, 609.2661-609.2665, 609.268(1) (1987 & 1992
Supp.) (murder, manslaughter); Mo. Rev. Stat.,  1.205, 565.024
(Vernon 1986) (involuntary manslaughter), as construed by the
Missouri Supreme Court in State v. Knapp. 843 S.W.2d 345 (Mo.
1992); N.D. Cent. Code,  12.1-17.1-01 to 12.1-17-04 (1991
Supp.) (murder, manslaughter); Utah Code Ann.,  76-5-201 et seq.
(1990 & 1992 Supp.) (any form of homicide).

         Six States define the killing of an unborn child after
quickening as a form of homicide: Fla. Stat. Ann.,  782.09 (West
1992) (manslaughter); Off. Code Geo. Ann.,  16-5-80 (1992)
(feticide); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.,  750.322 (West 1968)
(manslaughter) (limited by judicial decision to viability, see
Larkin v. Cahalan. 389 Mich. 533, 208 N.W.2d 176 (1973)); Miss.
Code Ann.,  97-3-37 (1972) (manslaughter); Okla. Stat. Ann.,
tit. 21,  713 (West 1983) (manslaughter); Wash. Rev. Code Ann.,
 9A.32.060(1)(b) (1986) (manslaughter).

         Three States define the killing of an unborn child after
viability as a form of homicide: Iowa Code Ann.,  707.7 (West
1979) (feticide); Tenn. Code Ann.,  39-13-214 (Michie 1991)
 (criminal homicide); R.I. Gen. Laws,  11-23-5 (Michie 1981)
 (manslaughter).

                                    440

         One State defines the killing of an unborn child after the
twenty-fourth week of pregnancy as a form of homicide: N.Y. Pen.
Law,  125.00 (McKinney's 1987) (homicide).

         In addition to these nineteen States, two other States--
Massachusetts and South Carolina--have held, without the benefit
of a specific fetal homicide statute, that the killing of a
viable unborn child is a form of homicide. See Commonwealth v.
Cass. 392 Mass. 799, 467 N.E.2d 1324 (1984) (vehicular homicide);
Commonwealth v. Lawrence. 404 Mass. 378, 383-84, 536 N.E.2d 571,
575-76 (1989) (involuntary manslaughter) ; State v. H o m e . 282

        The authors present the 1990 Gallup Organization Abortion and
        Moral Beliefs Survey from which they conclude that Americans are
        woefully ignorant about the state of law on abortion. Basically.
        U.S. Amencans know that a woman has a legal right to an abortion
        because of the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. However, there is
        great confusion as to when during a pregnancy a woman may ex-
        ercise her legal right. Additionally, the authors look at such issues
        as abortion and free choice, the impact of abortion on women's
        health and the relationship of the equality of women to Roe v. Wade.
        In conclusion they find that "the abortion privacy doctrine has
        spawned a great host of ills for women, without remedying any of
        the real historical injustices against them."

 1960s, a movement that sought to abolish abortion laws had some success: By the time
 of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade* in 1973. 19 states had "liberalized"
 their abortion laws to various degrees.3 Numerous rhetorical arguments were raised in
 justification of legalized abortion "as a humane solution to a critical social problem."6
 Legalized abortion was needed for population control,7 to promote maternal health,* to
 reduce child abuse,9 to alleviate poverty10 and to eliminate unsafe "back-alley abor-
 tions."" Many of these arguments were implicitly relied upon in the Supreme Court's
 opinion in Roe v. Wade,l2 in which the Court legalized abortion on demand through all
 nine months of pregnancy.13 In less than a decade, the status of abortion changed from
 being a crime in all 50 states to being widely perceived as a "constitutional right," a
 "fundamental freedom." As Lawrence Lader wrote, "[T]he Court went far beyond any
 of the 18 new state laws the movement had won since 1967, with only New York's law
 approaching its scope. It climaxed a social revolution whose magnitude and speed were
 probably unequaled in United States history." '*

        Yet the public rhetoric has shifted dramatically in the 20 years since Roe:

  102 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

          The most striking ideological development has been the emergence into
          leadership positions in the prochoice movement of some feminists who
         have scanted many of the original arguments for abortion reform. They
         have shifted the emphasis almost entirely to a woman's right to an abor-
         tion, whatever her reasons and whatever the consequences.15

 Today, the argument, almost exclusively, is that abortion--for any reason, at any time
 of pregnancy--is the "first right" for women; that is, women's unlimited access to
 abortion is essential for sexual equality and is the nonnegotiable prerequisite for all other
 social, economic or legal rights.16 As one abortion-rights activist has put it, "[w]e can
 get all the rights in the world . . . and none of them means a doggone thing if we don't
 own the flesh we stand in . . . " " Nevertheless, a sober assessment of this new justi-
 fication for elective abortion suggests that it was not founded on a genuine consideration
of women and their needs or on an accurate understanding of elective abortion in prac-
tice.

      The Supreme Court will have an opportunity to conform the legal reality more
closely to the philosophical and political reality of abortion's tragic impact on women
and society by upholding all provisions of the law challenged in Planned Parenthood v.
Casey.11 The Pennsylvania law sets forth minimal protections for women's physical and
psychological well-being. For example, it requires fully informed consent, with a 24-

         Lawrence Lader said much the same thing in 1973. L. Lader. supra note 5, at 18. But the message
   was not so single-minded. Indeed. Lader claims that "Friedan. one of the most impressive militants of her
   ume. avoided the abortion issue at first" and that, early on. he urged on her (implicitly to no avail) the
   proposition that "all feminist demands hinged on contraception and abortion and a woman's control over
   her own body and procreation, id. at 36.

"Quoted in K. Luker. Abortion A the Politics of Motherhood 97 QJ. Cat. Press paperback 198S).
         Those who view abortion as the "first right" are generally the same advocates of abortion rights who

   refuse to debate the morality of abortion because it is "off-limits'' (DeParle. Beyond the Legal Right: Why
   Liberals and Feminists Don't Like to Talk about the Morality of Abortion. Washington Monthly 28 (April
   1989). Even some modem abortion-rights supporters recognize the incongruity here.

           If. for some people, to have choice is itself the beginning and end of morality, for most
           people it u just the beginning. It does not end until a supportable, justifiable choice has
           been made, one that can be judged right or wrong by the individual herself based on some
           reasonably serious, not patently self-interested way of thinking about ethic*. That stan-
          dard--central to every major ethical system and tradition applifi to the moral life gener-
          ally, whether it be a matter of abortion or any other grave matter. An unwillingness to .
          come to grips with that standard not only puts site prochoice movement in jeopardy as a
          political force. It has a still more deleterious effect it is a bask threat to moral honesty and
          integrity. The cost of failing to take seriously me personal moral issues is to coon self-
          deception* and to be diawu to employ guiuents of expediency and evasion. --

hour waiting period to digest the information, and abortion statistical reporting. As
discussed below, in the profitable abortion marketplace, women are often deceived or
coerced into undergoing abortions they do not want. With an opportunity to evaluate
meaningful alternatives to abortions or to consult with a parent (in the case of a minor),
many unnecessary, unwanted abortions may be avoided.

                        n . Do Women Consider Abortion the "First Right"?

A. Current Public Opinion
        People who claim to speak for women and their fundamental reliance on completely

accessible abortion dominate the airwaves, the press and academic journals. Yet opinion
polls taken in recent years do not substantiate the alleged importance of abortion rights
to the majority of American women. For example, a New York Times poll of July 1989
indicated that most women were concerned more about job discrimination, child care
and balancing work and family than about abortion.19 These opinion polls did not deeply
probe underlying attitudes about abortion and other social issues.

       In 1990. the Gallup Organization conducted the largest and most comprehensive
survey of U.S. attitudes on abortion to date, the Abortion and Moral Beliefs Survey.20
One of the most striking conclusions from the survey is that Americans are woefully
ignorant about the state of U.S. law on abortion. Roe v. Wade legalized abortion throughout
pregnancy for any or no reason.21 Nine out of ten Americans simply do not know the
extent to which abortion is legally available.

"Abortion art Moral Beliefs Survey (May 1990) [hereinafter Survey]. In this survey, the Gallup Organization
   conducted * iterviews with 2.174 adults and asked 200 questions concerning abortion and related areas of
   moral belief and public policy, requiring a 45-minute personal interview. Gallup conducted the survey
   interviews and tabulated the survey findings. Question design and development was conducted by a learn
   of social scientists, including James Davison Hunter. Ph.D.. of the University of Virginia. Carl Bowman.
   Ph.D.. of Bridgewater College in Virginia, and Robert Wuthnow. Ph.D.. of Princeton University. James
   Rogers. Ph.D.. of Wheaton College. Wbeaton. Illinois and a Senior Research Associate at Northwestern
   University School of Medicine, analyzed and interpreted the data. The margin of error does not exceed

  may be greater. This survey was commissioned by Americans United for Life and is on file with the

21 The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade held that the states could not prohibit any abortions prior to viability.
  After viability, the Court said, the states mayprohibit abortion, "except where it is necessary, in appro-
  priate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." Roe. 410 U.S. at 165.
  But the Court then expanded the exception for "health of the mother" in a way to make it impossible for
  states to prohibit abortions. The Court held that Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Botton "are to bereadtogether,"
  id. at 165, and the Court defined "health" in Doe as "all factors--physical, emotional, psychological,
  familial and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to
  health." Doe v. Bolton. 410 U.S. 179. 192(1973). Both the Supreme Court and the lower federal coons
  have applied "health" in the third trimester in a very broad manner. Thomburgh v. American College of

  104 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

       Survey respondents were asked whether they were "very familiar," "fairly famil-
 iar." "not too familiar" or "not at all familiar" with "the 1973 Supreme Court deci-
 sion on abortion known &s Roe v. Wade." Only one in four of those who said that they
 were "very familiar" with Roe v. Wade could accurately state its outcome. Forty-two
 percent of the sample who stated that they were "very familiar," "fairly familiar" or
 "not too familiar" thought Roe legalized elective abortion only in the first three months.
 Among women who claimed at least some familiarity with Roe. 24% thought Roe meant
 that "abortions are legal only during the first three months, and only when a mother's
 life or health is threatened"; 39% thought Roe meant that "abortions are legal during
 the first three months, regardless of a woman's reasons for wanting one." Only 18% of
this subsample correctly indicated that Roe meant that "abortions are legal for the dura-
tion of pregnancy, regardless of a woman's reason for wanting one."

       This ignorance applies as well to the Supreme Court's July 1989 decision in Web-
ster v. Reproductive Health Services.32 Although the Abortion and Moral Beliefs Survey
was conducted 10 months after the decision, during which time there was extensive
media coverage, 8 out of 10 respondents stated mat they were "not at all familiar" with
the decision. Respondents were asked whether they thought they were "very familiar,"
"fairly familiar" or "not at all familiar" with "the 1989 Supreme Court decision on
abortion in the Webster case." Among women, 81% conceded that they were "not at
all familiar" with Webster. Among women who stated mat they were "very familiar"
or "fairly familiar" with the decision, 23% thought that "the legal outcome of the
Webster decision" was "best described" as "abortions are permitted only during the
first three months and only when a mother's life or health is threatened"; 10% thought
mat "abortions are now legal during the first three months, regardless of a woman's
reason for wanting one"; and another 31% thought that "abortions that are legal in one
state may be illegal in another." Only 5% knew that Webster means "abortions are
legal for the duration of the pregnancy regardless of a woman's reason for wanting
one."23

   1973) ("Even New York'! law appears to be overbroad in proscribing all abortions after 24 weeks except
   to preserve the woman's life, since the Court has held that an cjtccpuon must also be made for preservation
   of the woman's health (interpreted very broadly)").
C492 U.S. 490 (1989).
In Webster, me Supreme Court did not explicitly overrule Roe v. Wade; nor did the Court uphold any
  prohibition on abortion for any reason at any time of pregnancy. Rather, the Supreme Court upheld the
  wmimti^dfty of several provisions of a Missouri abortion statute, including a preamble, tests for fetal
  viability at or after 20>weeks gestation and prohibitions on public funding for abortion.

        The ACLU. in a brief filed before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, has characterized Webster at
  follows:

          In Webster, the Court found couninnionil provisions of a Missouri statute mat, unlike those
          enjoined here, dealt with the use of public resources for abortions and required certain tern
          lo determine viability. The Court dftfrminwi only that "none of the challenged provisions
          of the Missouri Act property before [it) conflict with the Consdmtion." 109 S. Ct. at 3058.
          The Webster plurality modified Roe only "to the extent" moused to uphold the Missouri
          statute. 109 S. Ct at 3058. Although Justice O'Connor, the critical fifth vote, mentions
          with approval her * -- --  t opinion m Akron, she uses the standards of Roe. and the
          majority opinions in Afrow and Thomourgn,to maium the coortnaionaliry of the vJabOity

                                                       IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 105

       The survey demonstrates that, after 19 years of legalized abortion nationwide, the
 American public still does not understand Roe and its policy of abortion on demand
 throughout pregnancy. If they did, they might not select the "prochoice" label so read-
 ily.24 In fact, the majority of Americans disapprove of the majority of abortions.23 Ap-
 proximately 25% of the sample disapproved of abortion in almost all circumstances
 except to save the life of the mother (the "consistently disapproves" group). Another
 26% disapproved of abortion when it is used for "birth control" or "sex selection"
 (the "seldom disapprove" group). The largest group, which makes up nearly 50% of
 the sample, disapproved of abortion except for certain "hard cases"--including danger
 to the life or physical health of the mother, rape, incest or serious fetal deformity (the
 "often disapprove" group). Yet, these cases represent no more than 5 percent of the
 1.6 million abortions performed each year.26

       The survey also showed that Americans have strong opinions about the nature of
the unborn. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents believed that abortion is either
 "an act of murder as bad as killing a bom human being" (37%), "an act of murder but
not as bad as killing a bom human being" (12%) or "the taking of human life" (28%).
Only 16% believed that abortion is merely a surgical procedure or the removal of tissue.
Fully 50% of the respondents believed that, from the moment of the child's conception,
the unborn child's right to be bom supersedes the woman's "right to choose." Only
23% believed that "the child's right to be bom" does not outweigh "the woman's right
to choose" until viability (16%) or birth (7%).

       Contrary to conventional wisdom, the survey demonstrated that there is no "gender
gap" on abortion, or at least not the one commonly assumed.27 More women than men

           there was "DO necessity to accept the State's invitation to reexamine the constitutional
           validity of Roe v. Wade." Id. at 3060 (O'Connor, J., coiv'rring). Thus. Justice Blackmun
           observed in his dissent, "the Court extricates itrslf from (W brier] without making a single,
           even incremental change in the law of abortion." 109 S. Ct. at 3067. And Justice Scalia
           severely chastises the Court for failing to take that step. Id. at 3064 (Scalia. J.. concurring).

     The "legal outcome" of Webster, therefore, ts that it leaves Roe undiluted In the aftermath of Webster.
  abortions are still legal throughout pregnancy virtually for any reason in almost all states. The jurispruden-
  uaJ door has been opened, however, for potentially greater state regulation of abortion. The "practical
  outcome" is that abortion is perceived as less available and that abortion rights are in jeopardy.
}<Thiny-three percent of the respondents identify themselves as "moderately prochoice" or "strongly pro-
   choice "
3 Answers to 29 questions in the survey were submitted to a statistical procedure known as "cluster analysis."
   The purpose of this analysis was to find groups of individuals who generally hold the same paneras of
   beliefs regarding abortion. The cluster analysis tests for the consistency of response through a range of
   questions and plots the attitudes of the survey respondents accordingly. As a result of this analysis, three
   clusters of public belief emerged

            those who "consistently disapprove" of abortion (25%)
            those who "often disapprove" of abortion (49%)
           those who "seldom disapprove" of abortion (26%)

 protective of unborn human life than were men.28

 fails to explain why more men than women favor abortion rights in public opinion
 surveys. It may be that men perceive greater benefits from freely available, relatively
 cheap abortion. Why else is the Playboy Foundation such a strong supporter of abortion
 rights--securing the exercise of the Playboy ethic with no fault, no mess for men?29
 "It is difficult to be loving and caring. It is challenging, demanding, exhausting, and
 expensive to provide the care and support needed by women in distress. It is much
 easier, quicker, and cheaper to send a woman to an abortionist."30 A recent article in
 Esquire about men and abortion reveals that in many cases the male partner suggested
 the abortion first.31

       Not only are women less supportive of abortion than men are, public opinion sur-
 veys and studies consistently show that many other issues--whether personal or pub-
 lic--are more important to women than abortion.32 Although women expressed concern
about the abortion issue, they were more concerned about other issues nearly a year
after the Webster decision. The Abortion and Moral Beliefs Survey revealed that, al-
though 52% of the women were "very concerned" and 29% were concerned" about
abortion, a higher percentage were "very concerned" about other public issues: child
abuse (85.8%), drug abuse (84.8%), AIDS (68.5%), environmental pollution (61.6%)
and homelessness (58.2%)." In ranking abortion among personal issues, women are
more concerned about equal pay (94%), day care (90%), rape (88%), maternity leave
(84%) and job discrimination (82%) than they are about abortion (74%).M These levels
of concern were expressed after the Webster decision when "abortion rights" were
considered to be in jeopardy. The rankings are consistent with a poll taken just days
before Webster when women were asked what should be the most important goal for

a Other surveys indicate that more women than men support criminal penalties for women who injure their

 women's organizations. Abortion ranked last (2%) behind job equality (27%), equal
 rights (14%) and child care (5%).35

 B. Women's Values and Self-Understanding
      Despite the opinion of American women as revealed in polls, the organized women's

 movement has come to stand predominantly for abortion advocacy. There is an obvious
discrepancy between the political agenda of the women's movement--and its philosoph-
 ical underpinnings in academic feminism--and the needs of the majority of mainstream
American women. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, as the
Abortion and Moral Beliefs Survey reveals, the women's movement is out of touch with
the fact that for a majority of women access to abortion is a low priority. It is also out
of touch with the feelings of the majority of women who consider abortion to be murder
or killing. Finally, the claim that abortion is a sine qua non negates women's own
understanding of themselves. One feminist legal scholar has characterized women as
valuing intimacy, nurturance, community, responsibility and care.36 Another observer--
an approving male--lauded four virtues of feminist thought, virtues that he perceived
abortion as violating: nonviolence, ecological harmony (the "deep connection between
our bodies and the earth"), community (inclusivity) and egalitarian power-sharing (co-
operation as a replacement for competition).37 These "feminine" values contrast with
allegedly "masculine" values.

         Women respond to their natural state of inequality by developing a mo-
         rality of nurturance that is responsible for the well-being of the depen-
        dent, and an ethic of care that respondsto the greater needs of the weak.
        Men respond to the natural state of equality with an ethic of autonomy
        and rights.*6

Yet much of the rhetoric of and philosophical support for the abortion-rights movement
is couched in "masculine" terms of autonomy ("it's my body") and rights ("not the
church, not the state, women must decide their fate").

      No matter what explanation is preferred, abortion advocacy fails both the political
and philosophical analysis. Politically, the women's movement has abandoned the very
people it claims to serve. Philosophically, the abortion ethic contradicts the essence of
women by seeking to destroy, rather than protect and nurture, the one with whom the
pregnant woman is so intimately connected. Abortion advocacy ignores, or at least
buries, the intuitive knowledge of women throughout the centuries. Long before the
emergence of rabbit tests or ultrasound, women (and therefore society) have intuitively
known the obvious: The entity conceived through intercourse is a child, their child.39

  110 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

       A recent, frank revelation on this score is that of California psychologist, Susan
 Nathanson, in her 1989 book. Soul Crisis.40 Nathanson's account of her abortion, at
 four weeks' gestation, an abortion that occurred after she had previously given birth to
 three children, is unique for her candid, strongly stated certainty about the humanity of
 her fourth, unborn child from conception.41 "My wish to have this unborn, though very
 alive, fourth child is so strong h is palpable."42 In contrast, she writes, the baby "doesn't
 have much reality" for her husband.43 Her experience is not unique. Women appear to
 identify and connect with the fetus as a child--their child--more than men do.44 Na-
 thanson cites an account of a friend who. upon revealing her own abortion of years ago,
 said she felt as though she had committed "murder."49 Years later Nathanson continues
 to have these feelings: ". . . i n ending the life of my child, I also annihilated a part of
 myself . . ."** Nathanson does not retreat from her conclusion. Rather, armed with
 this belief, she argues that abortion is a version of infanticide; women and society now
 must accept an ethic that allows (and perhaps encourages) women to both conceive and
kill their children according to their individual and family needs.47 Her goal is to help
women reconcile and embrace their power as both life-givers and "murderers."4* Pro-
choice feminist periodicals ignored Nathanson's book, perhaps because she recognizes
abortion as murder.49

       Nathanson's conclusions pinpoint the basis of the profound conflict over abortion
among women. Abortion advocacy illustrates the different views of self that women
hold, as Faye Ginsburg recognized in Contested Lives, a study of women in the pro-
choice and pro-life movements.50 The essential difference in the two concepts of self

                                                       IS ABORTION THE "TOST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 111

 among women is between those who consider child-bearing to be essential to the defi-
 nition of womanhood and those who see it as a mark of inequality with men that must
 be neutralized.31 As moral philosopher Janet Smith has written:

          [BJehind women's demands for unlimited access to abortion lies a profound
          displeasure with the way in which a woman's body works and hence a
          rejection of the value of being a woman. Whereas one might hope that
          the women's movement would be based on the assertion that it is great
          to be a woman and that women would endeavor to promote the powers
          and qualities which are theirs, the popularity of abortion indicates quite
          the opposite. Abortion is a denigration of women, a denial of one of the
          defining features of being a woman--her ability to bear children. Now
          some may deny that this is a defining characteristic of women. But is
          there any more certain criterion? A woman is a woman because she can
          bear children . . .

                Child-bearing is basic to them. We might expect that deliberate and
          violent denial of such a potential may be devastating. Some women argue
          that the fetus (be it a human being or not) is a part of their bodies and
          that they may do with it what they will. In one sense--a very different
          sense--the argument is true. Pregnancy and childbearing are perfectly
          normal conditions for women, and hence a part of her physical and psy-
          chological make-up. To have an abortion is to destroy part of one's self.
          It is normal for a woman to carry the children she conceives to term. To
          remove that child forcibly interrupts and harms the healthy functioning
          of her body. To put it bluntly, an abortion amounts to a mutilation of the
          woman's body and to a denial of her nature.52

Implicit in the position of those feminists who favor abortion rights is the view that
men's inability to conceive is somehow superior to women's unique ability to bear
children; women must be able "to have sex on a man's terms, not on a woman's."33 It
is this philosophical difference about the nature of unborn human life and pregnancy
more than any other, that distinguishes women's positions on abortion in America and
explains why, for many women, elective abortion can never be considered a basic right.

      Pro-life women question whether the assertion of "choice" and "rights" in rela-
tion to aborting an unborn child can be reconciled with nurturance and other values
cherished by feminists. Ginsburg writes that "[i]n opposition to the market relations of
capitalism, nurturance stands for noncontingent and self-sacrificing support and
love . . . " 5 4

         One of the central notions in the modern American construct of The Fam-
         ily is that of nurturance . . . a relationship that entails affection and

           love, that is based on cooperation as opposed to competition, that is
           enduring rather than temporary, that is noncontingent rather than con-
           tingent upon performance, and that is governed by feeling and morality
           instead of law and contract.55

 Abortion, a self-centered act, contradicts the very notion of nurturance as "self-sacrific-
 ing support and l o v e / ' 3 6 Abortion as a prerequisite for equality with men contradicts
 the value of cooperation. Abortion as a protection against the "invasion" of the unborn
 child contradicts connectedness with, and care for, that child. Ginsburg perceptively
 noted that, "[p]ro-life advocates critique a cultural and social system that assigns nur-
 turance to women yet degrades it as a vocation."97

       Commitment to the family and its associated values of nurturance, love, coopera-
 tion, and permanence is not limited to identifiable pro-life advocates. One woman at-
 torney who had a "high-powered job as a commercial litigator" surprised herself when
 she gave up part-time day care for her infant son in order to be home with him full
 time. She observed:

          It is easy to talk about combining kids and careers until you really do the
          mixing. The problem is not, as many of the young feminists I meet at the
          law school apparently believe, that some repressive male chauvinists are
          bent on keeping women in the home, and trying to recreate a stupid,
          sexist way of having a family. The problem is that women care too much
          about their children to abandon them to someone else . . .

                 Women naturally love their children and want to spend tune with
          them. To say otherwise, to try to fit ourselves into a new model, is itself
          a terrible oppression of women--an oppression often by the very people
          who call themselves feminists.51

Only recently is the feminist movement waking up to this woman's concerns. Columnist
Susanne Fields commented, "Almost every poll tells us that mothers of young children
would like to spend more time at home with them. Liberal feminists, who have until
now stressed individual rights of women over the collective needs of the family, are
getting that message."99 The continuing demand for elective abortion starkly contrasts
with this reawakening to family needs. And this reawakening may further erode support
for abortion rights.

      No individual or group can tolerate forever a basic inconsistency with its human
nature, whether this contradiction is imposed by government, religion or acadcmia
Most women affirm their identity as life-giver, child-bearer, nurturer and cooperator and
their connectedness with the vulnerable. A claim of the power and right to wield the
knife of abortion, whether at her own hands or the physician's, violates the core of
woman's values and being. Last but not least, it also stands starkly outside the main-
stream of historical feminist thought.

                                                       IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT* FOR WOMEN? 113

 C. The Early Feminist Views on Abortion
       Contemporary women's strong convictions against abortion were shared by the

 early American feminists in the 19th century, who "celebrated motherhood itself as a
 uniquely female power and strength that deserved genuine reverence."60 Indeed, "the
 founding mothers of the women's movement staunchly opposed abortion, even to the
 point of supporting the late nineteenth century legislative campaign against it."61

       Early feminist opposition to abortion has been dismissed as nothing more than an
 insufficient philosophical divorce from 19th century patriarchal society.62 But this is a
 superficial reading. The 19th century leaders of the women's movement did not view
 legalized abortion as a solution to the oppression and disenfranchisement of women.
 They understood that abortion occurred because of that inequality. They understood that
 abortion is something done to women, by men. for men. Early feminists were uniformly
 opposed to abortion--including Susan B. Anthony. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda
 Gage, Victoria Woodhull, Sarah F. Norton and Mattie H. Brinkerhoff. They commonly
 called it "ante-natal child murder,"63 "child murder"6* and "infanticide."65 They
 believed that "[l]ife must be present from the very moment of conception."66

       The early feminists condemned not only the practice of abortion. They were equally
 concerned about its causes: ignorance about sexuality and reproduction, the view of
 pregnancy as a pathological condition, the double standard that promoted male irrespon-
 sibility, social pressures against illegitimacy and lack of economic support to single
 mothers.67 Susan B. Anthony's and Elizabeth Cady Stanton's journal. The Revolution,
often contained articles or editorials denouncing abortion's causes and tragic effects.
 Mattie Brinkerhoff wrote:

          [AJs law and custom give to the husband the absolute control of the
          wife's person, she is forced to not ont  violate physical law. but to out-
          rage the holiest instincts of her being . . .
          When a man steals to satisfy hunger, we may safely conclude that there
          is something wrong with society--so when a woman destroys the life of
          her unborn child, it is an evidence that either by education or circum-
          stances she has been greatly wronged.*6

       Dr. Charlotte Lozier, a New York physician, in 1869 reported to the authorities a
man who brought a young woman to her for an abortion. She then extended other

 assistance to the young woman. For this act. Lozier was praised in The Revolution a
 eulogized after her death by Pauline Wright Davis, an eminent suffragist:

           (Lozier's} sense of justice would not allow her to let the wrong-doer
           escape the penalty of the law. while at the same time she pitied and
           tenderly cared for the victim. We have been amazed to hear her de-
           nounced for this brave, noble act on the ground of professional privacy.
           It is said she had no right to expose the outrage of having one thousand
           dollars offered her to commit murder. The murder of the innocents goes
           on. Shame and crime after crime darken the history of our whole land.
          Hence it was fitting that a true woman should protest with all the energy
          of her soul against this woeful crime.M

       The 19th century feminists forcefully wrote that the only remedy for this "fearful
 ravage" was "the education and enfranchisement of women."70 They originated the
 then-radical philosophy of "voluntary motherhood," which declared a woman's right
 to avoid pregnancy as she chose, through birth control or abstinence but not through
 abortion. They sought "prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of
 the evil."71

       Their desire for legal reform to protect and improve the circumstances of women72
was accompanied by support for legal sanctions against the proliferating abortion trade,
known commonly as "Restellism." The Revolution editorialized in favor of legislation
to restrict abortifacient drugs and remedies on grounds that "Restellism has long found
in those broths of Bellzebub, its securest hiding place."73

       In the early 20th century, opposition to abortion by feminists continued. Alice
Paul, founder ana chair of the National Woman's Party and author of the original Equal
Rights Amendment in the 1920s, is recognized as "the foremost feminist of this cen-
tury." She said that "(a]bortion is just another way of exploiting women."74 Contem-
porary women's opposition to abortion thus has a dear philosophical link to the origins
of American feminism.

D. Contemporary Feminist Understanding of Women
       It was not until the late 1960s that the women's movement began demanding abor-

tion rights. The movement was conceived and portrayed as a revolt against "the tradi-
tional female role," inspired in part by Betty Friedan's book. The Feminine Mystique.19

 equal basis with men. This encompassed an effort to attain biological sameness as well.
 Some women hated the uniqueness of the female body and one called gender differences
 "metaphysical cannibalism."76 Abortion was deemed necessary to avoid the burdens of
 pregnancy, which men would not share. This "female oppression" was seen as the
 "most deeply ingrained injustice in history."77

       However, the reality of gender differences could not be ignored. Women came to
 the realization that being treated exactly like a man was not the panacea they had hoped.
 "Sameness" did not yield equality. Women learned that the rigors they encountered in
 the workplace were just as brutalizing to men. In addition, many women ended up going
 home from work to face the "second shift," where women perform 75% of the house-
 work and child care.78 Academic feminist thought eventually took into account the real-
 ity that this "first-stage" feminism or "equality feminism" lets men have it both ways--
 enjoying the second income of the wife while expecting her to fulfill a more traditional
 role at home.79

       Even Betty Friedan now recognizes the "superwoman" fallacy. Speaking at Smith
 College's commencement, Ms. Friedan told the audience that "having it all" and being
 a "superwoman" have been

          a cruel illusion. Women have been spared petty prejudice only to be met
          with personal catastrophe. For the first time in American history, women
          work far harder than their mothers. And they miscarry more, are di-
          vorced more, abandoned more, abused more, and fall into poverty more.10

       Contemporary feminism then tried to compensate for its disillusionment with "ab-
solute equality" by developing "difference feminism" or "second-stage feminism,"81

          None of the very real problems facing women today, from finding ways
          to combine fruitful work with a nurturing family life, to rescuing women
         from the economic disaster of divorce, can be resolved without abandon-
          ing the failed doctrine of sexual androgyny. That is, without firmly and
          quite unashamedly acknowledging the distinctive needs, desires, and con-
          tributions of women.92

Difference feminism "questioned the move towards full assimilation of female identity
with public male identity and argued mat to see women's traditional roles and activities
as wholly oppressive was itself oppressive to women, denying them historic subjective
and moral agency."13 Dr. Barbara Bardes, dean of the University College of Loyola
University in Chicago, calls this the "post-feminist age:** "It represents a consciousness
that women acknowledge their desire to be mothers--that they want to be different but

 equal.""4 This second-stage feminism (or difference feminism) acknowledges and ac-
 cepts that women are biologically different than men. Second-stage feminism looks at
 each problem or human condition from the unique perspective of women. But not all
 feminists who acknowledge sexual differences seek equality. Some make " . . . no
 pretense of (desiring] equal treatment but rather the pursuit of privilege to compensate
 for the great range of psycho-sexual differences between the genders."*9

       Nonetheless, this trend in feminism acknowledges values that most women intu-
 itively share: nurturing, responsibility, caring for others and a sense of community.
 Carol Gilligan concluded in In a Different Voice that men reason from ideas of individ-
 ual rights and fair play, while women reason from ideas of individual responsibility and
 concern for others.*6 This, of course, is the age-old dichotomy between justice and
 mercy, that, together, establish the foundation of the human community. But these
 "feminine" values are not unique to women. Men, too, can be nurturing and care for
 others, just as women may pursue autonomy and individual rights. But to negate or
compromise nurturance and inclusivity destroys the essence of women's self-concept, a
deep, inseparable, part of who they are. Thus, the assumption that women need abortion
 as their "first right" represents a profound misunderstanding of the nature of women.

       The commitment to abortion rights creates some glaring inconsistencies for femi-
nism. "Today, this inconsistency shows up in the heat of political debate, as pro-choice
activists switch back and forth between the two kinds of feminism to defend the absolute
right to abortion."*7 The reason for this dilemma is not difficult to understand: "It is
not easy to reconcile the feminine metaphors of motherhood and community with the
feminist defense of abortion on the grounds of individual right."** This inability of
abortion advocates to reconcile these conflicts, accompanied by determined adherence
to abortion rights, leaves many American women--those who do not r* the trends in
feminist theory--unpersuaded. Despite the self-proclaimed success of some women's
organizations, particularly as abortion advocates, a 1989 survey found that only 25% of
women agreed that women's organizations have done something that "made your life
better."89

      This confusion--about who women are, what women want and what women be-
lieve "woman's role" to be--is no more evident man in the view of unborn children.
If feminine values are nurturing and inclusive, does abortion fit in? As individuals with
abilities and aspirations, women make moral choices as women, in the context of rela-
tionships. Those relationships include those who are dependent and vulnerable. And the
one who is most dependent on a woman--for her nurturance, compassion, strength,
courage and wisdom--4s the child in her womb. Mature feminism, therefore, would
contemplate that society accommodate the reproductive capacities of women, mat child-
bearing and rearing be valued just as much as, if not more, than establishing financial
security and job satisfaction.

      The deep needs and feelings of many American women may more accurately be
reflected by what has been described as "conservative feminism" or "classical ferni-

 nism." In her essay. "What Do Women Want?." Katherine Kersten concludes that
 classical feminism "teaches women that their horizons should be as limitless as men's."90
 She explains:

           What sets me apart from most contemporary feminists is that--more than
          anger at the injustices done to women in the past--I feel gratitude toward
          the social and political system that has made much-needed reform pos-
          sible . . .

                 Consequently. I propose an alternative to the feminism of the women's
          studies departments and "public interest" lobbies. I envision a self-con-
          sciously conservative feminism, inspired by what is best in our tradition,
          that can speak to women's concerns in both the private and public spheres.
          Such a feminism is based on three premises: first, that uniform standards
          of equality and justice must apply to both sexes; second, that women have
          historically suffered from injustice, and continue to do so today; and
          third, that the problems that confront women can best be addressed by
          building on--rather than repudiating--the ideals and institutions of West-
          ern culture.91

The conservative feminist seeks the full participation of women in all aspects of cultural
and personal development "to develop their talents, to follow their interests to their
natural conclusion, to seek adventure, to ask and answer the great questions, and to
select from a multitude of social roles," Kersten says.92

       This view embraces feminine values, seeing "the special bond of motherhood not
as evidence of oppression, but as cause for thanksgiving."93 Many women would agree.
Abortion as the "first right" thus stands outside the early tradition of feminism and
most contemporary women's self-perception. And although it may be politically correct
to espouse abortion as the foundation for women's freedom and progress, it has not
truly benefited women. Abortion promotes neither the core values of women, such as
inclusiveness and nurturance, nor the premises of autonomy and choice upon which it
is based.

A. Male Coercion, Pressure, Denial, Abandonment
      Abortion as women's "first right" is premised on abortion as a free, self-deter-

mined choice. The abortion-rights movement raised up "freedom of choice" as its ubiq-
uitous slogan in the 1980s. Roe v. Wade symbolizes "freedom" to choose abortion.
Press releases and advertising suggest that, unless Roe v. Wade is overturned and re-
strictive abortion laws are reinstated, abortion will remain a "free choice." But is me
abortion choice really free?

      The creation and expansion of the nniitr^^ abortion doctrine first enunciated in
Roe v. Wade actually isolated women in their contemplation of abortion. First, in Roe,

   t IS ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

  the Court held that a woman had the "right" to decide to have an abortion for any and
  every reason at any time of pregnancy. Three years later, in Planned Parenthood v.
  Danfonh.9* the Court imposed a revolutionary social law on American men, women,
  and children: Men have no rights whatever to protect their child before birth. Ironically,
  the Court recognized that although the woman presumably makes the abortion decision
  "with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband . . . it
 could be said that she is acting unilaterally."99 Nonetheless, it approved the unilateral
 power of the woman to prevent her husband (much less a man to whom she is not
 married) from protecting his own offspring. These two decisions placed all "choice"--
 the choice to abort or not to abort--on the pregnant woman. By necessary implication,
 whether the child lives or dies is solely up to the pregnant woman. Since that exclusive
 power over the child's life is under the woman's control, the determination whether the
 father will become the father of born offspring and incur child-support obligations falls
 entirely on the mother. She becomes the only one who can eliminate this expense.

        The logic of women's exclusive control over reproduction is not lost on men. By
 vesting all rights to abort in the mother alone and by stripping the man of all his parental
 rights, it psychologically divests the man of all responsibility as well. It undermines
 healthy relationships between men and women. It destroys responsible communication
 by creating an artificial barrier to discussing a matter that deeply affects not only the
 woman but her partner as well. Men naturally may respond with distrust. The motives
 of all women, both those who demand and those who refuse abortion, come under
 suspicion. True intimacy cannot develop when a relationship lacks trust and commu-
 nication. Coercion, pressure, abandonment and denial of responsibility all result.

       What exacerbates this legal wedge in the relationship between men and women is
 the fact that 80% of all abortions are performed on single women.96 In such a relation-
 sL >, the man bears no legal obligation unless the child survives. Frequently, he neither
 prepares for nor desires any child. By its very nature, such a relationship creates the
 greatest potential for male coercion, denial of responsibility and abandonment when
pregnancy results.

       One of the myths of the abortion liberty--and Roe v. Wade--is that it only created
a right to choose abortion for women who wanted abortion; it did not force anyone to
abort or to participate in abortion. But over the past 15 years, it has become increasingly
dear that coercion and pressure on women play a significant role in many, if not most,
decisions to have an abortion.97

       One of the most compelling accounts is Susan Nathanson's story about her abortion
and subsequent psychotherapy.9* Nathanson is no pro-life advocate. Indeed, she wrote

 her book to make the argument for abortion rights and to support Roe v. Wade." But
 she writes honestly. The night before her abortion she sat. watching out the window of
 her house: "But mostly I sit with the life of my fourth child growing inside me, trying
 to contemplate this ending, and I grieve and grieve and grieve and grieve." l0

       Coercion by her husband played a primary and determinative role in her abor-
 tion. "I am absolutely clear that I do not want a fourth child under any circumstances,"
 he said.101 "If you don't choose to abort this child, I will push you to do it."102
 Nathanson felt she had little alternative: "It is at this moment that I know that / will
 take responsibility for the decision that must be made and that I will have an abortion,
 even though Michael and I will repeat this discussion over the next few days with
 no variation in our positions."103 Some time after the abortion, her husband realized
 that he "pushed [her] to make the decision to have an abortion."l0* Much of the last
pan of her book describes her post-abortion counseling. It does not seem to help
when, five years later, her husband suggests that they could have had that fourth
child after all: "I was so worried about my physical well-being then. I don't have that
apprehension now. Now I feel as if we really could have managed to raise thatchild.''i0S Un-
able to respond to his untimely admission, Nathanson has "no answer" for her husband.
What is remarkable about this account is that it happened within an apparently healthy
marriage--under ideal economic, social and emotional conditions to support mother
and child. If the abortion liberty can prompt such coercion within an intact marriage,
its impact on extramarital relationships can only breed more disastrous consequences.

      Coercion or pressure to have an abortion is reflected in court cases of various kinds
around the country.106 In some cases, fathers raise the woman's "right to abortion" as
an affirmative defense to child support. The defense is usually framed in the following
terms: The woman got pregnant by a man to whom she was not married: he did not
want to get married or to support the child; she could have had an abortion, and he
offered to pay for that abortion; she has a constitutional right to get an abortion, and he
is legally helpless to prevent it; by her failure to obtain an abortion, she took sole
responsibility for the child; therefore, the man should not be liable for any child support.
Fortunately for the women and children involved, all courts have apparently rejected
this defense.107 But they have done so only by evading the logic of Roe v. Wade. In
other variations on this theme, men have sued to "enforce" a contract to undergo an

 abortion.10* Women have been subjected to unconsented abortion performed by 
 physician-lover,109 defenses to child support for "misrepresenting" the nonuse of con-
 traception " or clauses in surrogate mother contracts requiring the surrogate mother to
 undergo an abortion for various reasons. Few disputes end up in court, and even fewer
 appear in published court decisions. There are countless scenarios in which the man
 threatened nonsupport but did not follow through with a lawsuit.111

       Coercion to have an abortion is also reported in scholarly journals. A survey from
 the Medical College of Ohio examined a sample of 150 women who "identified mem-
 selves as having poorly assimilated the abortion experience." m Of the 81 women who
 responded, "more than one-third felt they had been coerced into their decision"; less
 than one-third of these women initially considered the abortion themselves.

       There is a tendency to suggest that male coercion is simply a kink that needs to be
 worked out of our policy of legalized abortion.113 But male coercion is an inevitable
 tragic consequence of legal abortion on demand inaugurated by Roe. This endemic coer-
 cion is revealed in Carol Gilligan's work. In a Different Voice.11* Gilligan determined
 that the women she interviewed processed their abortion decision consistent with objec-
 tive moral reasoning and based on principles of care, concern, responsibility and non-
 violence. Gilligan suggested, "The sequence of women's moral judgment proceeds from
an initial concern with survival to a focus on goodness and finally to a reflective under-
standing of care as the most adequate guide to the resolution of conflicts in human
relationships."1'9 Gilligan's sample, however, reveals that many decisions were not
independent, moral choices. Male coercion played an important role in a number of
cases.116 Harvard Law Professor Mary Ann Glendon observed: "It is striking how many

 of Carol Gilligan's subjects in her chapter on the abortion decision stated that one of
 the reasons they were seeking abortions was because the men in their lives were un-
 willing to give them moral and material support in continuing with pregnancy and child-
 birth. This fact surely must have been central to their moral dilemma, but Gilligan.
 surprisingly, never picks up on this aspect of her data." " 7 Gilligan--who has a repu-
 tation as the foremost feminist analyst of women's abortion rights and independent de-
 cision-making--evidently could not distinguish independent judgment from coercion.

       Gilligan's conclusions have been challenged by moral philosopher Janet Smith and
 others on precisely this point."* Gilligan does not approve of being "self-sacrificing."
 Nor does she believe that any act, including abortion, is intrinsically immoral, though
 she believes that abortion is often the "morally responsible" choice."9 How can the
 demand for arbitrary life-and-death power over one's own children be morally "respon-
 sible," as Gilligan claims? This claim for exclusive dominion over the fetus is nothing
 short of viewing the child as property.120 This directly conflicts with what women know
about their own children: "This child is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone." "This
daughter has my blue eyes; this son has my dark hair." It was not so long ago that
 wives were treated as the property of their husbands (and, in some parts of the world,
they still are).12' If it is wrong for men to treat others as possessions, it is wrong for
women, too.

       Who has abortion freed? Legalized abortion has helped create a sexual climate
throughout our country by which men are freed to engage in the most irresponsible
sexual relations, and the consequences fall directly and solely upon the woman. Women
are left to pay the price. Kathleen Kersten highlights the painful consequences of sex
without commitment:

          Feminists often explain traa tional restraints on women's sexual freedom
          in one-dimensional terms, dismissing them as male attempts to wrest con-
          trol of women's vital reproductive functions.

                 . . . But women are wrong to assert that sex without commitment
          is no more dangerous for women than it is for men. We know now that
          sex of this sort has led to an epidemic of abortions, venereal disease,
         and female infertility; a host of unwanted children; and a sorry legacy of
          educations and careers--women's, not men's--cut short.1*1

      Contrary to what might be the popular impression, abortion does not solve or heal
relationships. Indeed, it usually dissolves them. "When one partner wants a child and
the other doesn't, an abortion often leads to a breakup." m

  122 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

           The most common male response to unwanted pregnancy when it occurs
          outside of marriage has been to "take off," leaving the woman to bear
          the physical, the emotional and. often, the financial brunt of either hav-
          ing an abortion or carrying the pregnancy to term. Studies of abortion
          and its aftermath reveal that, more often than not. relationships do not
          survive an abortion: the majority of unmarried couples break up either
          before or soon after an abortion.m

 Men are freed to engage in behavior without serious personal consequences, knowing
 that it is both the woman's "right" and "responsibility" to get an abortion if anything
 goes "wrong."I2S He has the "security" that the woman can obtain an "easy," "safe,"
 "painless," "quick" abortion, for which he might pay $200 to S300.126

       Freely available legal abortion thus encourages the very kind of male behavior mat
feminists have railed against for generations. "Modern ideology makes it easy for men
to rationalize their defection from family life. . . " m Even an abortion rights advocate
like Daniel Callahan can see this: "If legal abortion has given women more choice, it
has also given men more choice as well. They now have a potent new weapon in the
old business of manipulating and abandoning women." m Since 80% of abortions are
performed on single women, who are outside the protective circle of family life, it is
probable that the man is strongly inclined to not want their child.129 His pressure on the
woman to "choose" her legally endorsed alternative is virtually inevitable.130 The no-
tion among modern feminists mat restrictive abortion laws support "male domination"
is tragic foolishness. It is directly contradicted by real human experience with abortion
on demand in the United States over the past 19 years.

B. Parental Coercion
      Men are now the only source of coercion. Parental coerck of teens does occur,

and it can be overwhelming.131 The extent of this pressure is difricult to document, but
one example illustrates the extremes to which parents may go to compel their daughter
to have an abortion. ChristyAnne Collins is executive director of an organization that
provides crisis pregnancy assistance: counseling, medical services and placement ser-
vices. She was appointed by a Rockville, Maryland circuit judge as legal guardian for
a 16-year-old woman ("Jane Doe") who wanted to continue her pregnancy.132 The
previous year, Jane Doe had been forced by her parents to abort an earlier pregnancy.133

                                                               IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT* FOR WOMEN? 123

 In order to exercise her choice to cany her second pregnancy to term, Jane Doe had to
 turn to the courts for protection from her parents. It is ironic that this occurred in
 Maryland, a state that excludes parental influence in preventing an abortion.

       Another teenager, this time the victim of rape, was taken against her will to a
 Bremerton. Washington abortion clinic. Although she screamed that she did not want
 an abortion, the abortionist and nurse, in unsanitary clothing, forced this teen to undergo
 the procedure. Police detective Linda Johnson--who had been ordered against her will
 to gather the fetal remains as evidence against the rapist--attempted suicide more than
 a dozen times and was treated at a mental health clinic.134

       A more widely published example of coercion--not choice--is that of Denise Le-
 febvre in Florida. Denise is apparently psychotic and routinely takes lithium, an anti-
psychotic drug known to cause birth defects. In 1990, she stopped taking the drug when
she suspected she was pregnant, even though her condition renders her dangerous to
herself and others when she is not medicated. She apparently stopped the medication to
protect her unborn child, and spent virtually all her pregnancy confined to a hospital--
strapped to the bed for her own protection. The assistant public defender who eventually
represented her said, "This woman is very lucid regarding her baby. Everyone wanted
to give the woman an abortion except her."133 Indeed, the physicians involved, and
even her father, sought to order an abortion against her will. They argued that there was
a chance of fetal defect based on possible exposure to lithium. Florida law provides for
"termination of pregnancy" for incompetent women if certain procedural safeguards are
extended.136 For example, a three-member examining committee must be appointed be-
fore a determination of incapacity is made, and written consent of the woman's court-
appointed guardian must be obtained before the pregnancy can be terminated. Lefebvre
was originally denied all the procedural protections due her, and the trial court ordered
an abortion. The appeals court reversed the decision solely on procedural error. A healthy
baby boy was bom just after Christmas. At last report, the baby was scheduled to be
adopted by other Lefebvre family members.137

C. Social Pressure
      Perhaps as much as direct coercion, women cite a lack of alternatives--or their

belief that they had no alternative--as the reason for abortion.13* Some women view
abortion as a "forced response to a problem, rather than an affirmative action in their
lives."IW This may be due, st least in pan, to inadequate counseling.140 This situation
seems not to have changed in 30 years. In 1960, Mary Calderone, the medical director
of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, wrote:

  124 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

           Conference members agreed, and this was backed up by evidence from
           the Scandinavians, that when a woman seeking an abortion is given the
           chance of talking over her problem with a properly trained and oriented
          person, she will in the process very often resolve many of her qualms
           and will spontaneously decide to see the pregnancy through, particularly
           if she is assured that supportive help will continue to be available to
          her.141

       Besides feeling alone and without resources, a pregnant woman may also sense the
 pressure of the workplace. For example, a recent study of female medical residents
 reported open hostility to pregnant residents from program directors and colleagues.142
 The percent of abortion among female residents, was threefold mat of the control group.143
 And those residents and physicians who chose to carry their pregnancies to term were
 "more likely to underreport their symptoms in order to minimize the influence of their
pregnancy on their work." '**

       Similarly, women lawyers are aware of the same subtle bias against having chil-
dren. An article in the National Law Journal noted that law firms have been unable or
unwilling to create an environment supportive of working mothers.149 Women who want
to make partner are told not to get pregnant until the partnership is secure. Those who
do choose motherhood are often put on the "mommy track," with no likelihood of
achieving partnership. In another recent incident, the New York City Department of
Corrections settled a lawsuit filed by several female officers who had been told to have
abortions; many who refused were given physically grueling jobs.146

D. Failure to Protect Wanted Children
       Abortion-rights advocacy goes to such lengths as to vig nously fight against any

legislative attempts to protect the child of the woman who chooses nurturance. For
example, in 1991 the New Hampshire legislature considered and passed a fetal homicide
bill that would penalize the killing of an unborn child by a third person (other than an
abortionist). A criminally assaulted pregnant woman who did not previously choose
abortion presumably desires to carry her child to term. The bill was opposed by the
National Abortion Rights Action League of New Hampshire. Spokesperson Peg Dobbie
argued that it would lead to limitations or restrictions on "a woman's reproductive
right."l47 A similar bill was defeated by abortion-rights advocates in Delaware in 1991.M
Thus the pro-choice position claims that a woman who chooses to give birth should be
given no legal protection, even after viability, for the child she carries in her womb.

                                                     IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT* FOR WOMEN? 125

      Nor does the pro-choice position permit state encouragement of healthy prenatal
care. This has led to a strange alliance between the National Organization for Women
(NOW) and tavern owners .in New York, both of whom oppose mandatory posting of
signs that warn pregnant women of the dangers of alcohol consumption. The warning-
sign legislation is an attack on the woman's right to "choose," according to state NOW
president Marilyn Fitterman.149

       "Freedom of choice" appears to be a one-way street when the issue is abortion.
For Denise Lefebvre and Jane Doe, their choice not to have an abortion was opposed
by those with more power, this resonates of patriarchy and chauvinism. These women,
and many like them, are vulnerable to a system that is geared to deal with problem
pregnancies by eliminating the unborn child. Feminism supposedly stands against pa-
triarchy and paternalism. Yet silence or outright opposition from the women's move-
ment in the face of real harm to real women belies their claim to represent women.
"Choice" has come to mean that abortion is a moral good, and any law that might
influence a woman to consider an alternative to abortion or that establishes governmental
protection for the child in utero is suspect. The "choice" agenda is not truly about
protecting women; it is about promoting abortion.

                        IV. The Impact of Abortion on Women's Health

A. The Use and Misuse of Abortion Statistics
      A current abortion-rights slogan is, "Keep abortions safe and legal!" The phrase

fosters the assumption that, invariably, legal abortions are safe and illegal abortions are
not. The evidence fails to support mis claim.

      Prior to Roe v. Wade, proponents of legalized abortion sought to eradicate "back-
alley abortions," alleging they were dangerous because they were illegal. In their view,
illegality meant that only criminal abortionists--unskilled and uncaring--performed
abortions.150 Liberalization of abortion laws should therefore eliminate, or at least sub-
stantially reduce, abortion morbidity. Part and parcel of this campaign was the claim
about the large number of illegal abortions performed before 1973. Based on a 19S5
conference sponsored by Planned Parenthood, a figure of 200,000 to 1,200,000 was
widely cited for the next 20 years.131 Although there is anecdotal evidence of illegal

 abortions and illegal abortion counseling and referral, the actual number of abortions is
 very difficult to quantify. Most of the anecdotes appear to stem from the 1960s.132 Just
 a few years later, both the incidence and dangers of abortion were in question. In 1960,
 Mary Calderone, Planned Parenthood's medical director, concluded that "90% of all
 illegal abortions are presently done by physicians."'"

       Calderone wrote:

          Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure. This applies not just to
          therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal
          abortions as done by physicians. In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in
          the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind . . . Two corollary
          factors must be mentioned here: first, chemotherapy and antibiotics have
          come in, benefiting all surgical procedures as well as abortion. Second,
          and even more important, the [1955 Planned Parenthood) conference
          estimated that 90 per cent of all illegal abortions are presently done by
          physicians. Call them what you will, abortionists or anything else, they
          are still physicians, trained as such; and many of them are in good stand-
          ing in their communities. They must do a pretty good job if the death
          rate is as low as it is. Whatever trouble arises usually comes after self-
          induced abortions, which comprise approximately 8 per cent, or with the
          very small percentage that go to some kind of nonmedical abortionist.
          Another corollary fact: physicians of impeccable standing are referring
          their patients for these illegal abortions to the colleagues whom they
          know are willing to perform them, or they are sending their patients to
          certain sources outside of this country where abortion is performed under
          excellent medical conditions . . . So remember fact number three; abor-
          tion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous,
          because it is being done well by physicians.I34

      Nonetheless, later reports exaggerated the numbers of maternal deaths from illegal
aboition as ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 deaths annually.193 One founder of the Na-

tional Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (now the National Abortion Rights
Action League--NARAL) later conceded, in retrospect, that such claims were completely
false and were for rhetorical purposes only. ' * These allegations ignored evidence of the
tremendous reduction in abortion-related deaths in the prior 30 years due to advances in
medical care.137 The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reported 39 illegal abortion-
related deaths and 24 legal abortion-related deaths in 1972, the last full year before
abortion was nationally legalized by Roe v. Wade.I3S

       Abortion proponents, who argued that legalized abortion would prevent maternal
deaths from childbirth, have cited national statistics to prove that abortion is physically
safer than childbirth.199 This argument is undermined, however, by technological ad-
vances in the 1960s by which "medical science has now made it possible for all but the
most severely medically ill women to give birth safely."160 Mary Calderone said in
1960, "Medically speaking, that is, from the point of view of diseases of the various
systems . . . it is hardly ever necessary today to consider the life of a mother as threat-
ened by a pregnancy."161 Both general maternal mortality and abortion-related maternal
mortality have been on a steady downward trend for decades. The legalization of abor-
tion has had little effect on this trend.162 Claims that "abortion is safer than childbirth"

 are compromised not only by the likelihood that deaths relating to abortion are underre-
 ported but also by the fact that the methods employed by some statisticians do not
 represent a valid comparison between abortion and childbirth: Most studies consider as
 deaths related to "childbirth" virtually all cases of maternal mortality not related to
 abortion, why and whenever they occur. When comparison is made between abortion
 and natural pregnancy during corresponding periods of gestation, natural pregnancy is
 shown to be safer than induced aboition at every stage.163

       In contrast to unsubstantiated claims about the danger of illegal aboition and the
 risks of childbirth, legal aboition has been consistently publicized since Roe as "safe"
 and "easy." Abortion advocates vehemently assert that recriminalizing abortion will
 inevitably make it unsafe. Likewise, proponents allege that legal abortion has little neg-
 ative psychological impact. At most, abortion advocates concede short-term negative
psychological reaction but no long-term negative consequences. And in any case, psy-
chological consequences from abortion are alleged to be less than, or no greater than,
those following childbirth.164 (The psychological impact of legal aboition is discussed
in subsection E. below.)

       In truth, the physical effects of legalized aboition are difficult to quantify accu-
rately. The late Christopher Tietze, Planned Parenthood's statistician, wrote in a prior
edition of this book:

          Abortion-related deaths are of course only the proverbial tip of the ice-
          berg. Nationwide information on the incidence of nonfatal complications
          of legal abortion, including major complications requiring inpatient care,
          is far less complete than information on abortion-related mortality. This
          is so because there is no agreement among investigators as to what con-
          stitutes a major complication, and no system of surveillance is in place.165

Only two national agencies have the capacity to compile national data about aboition,
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanu (a division of the federal Department

      It is difficult to determine an objective relationship between legality and safety. "Legal abortion" is
   defined by CDC officials "as a procedure performed by a licensed physician or by someone acting under
   the supervision of a licensed physician." while an "illegal abortion" is defined "as a procedure performed
   by die woman herself or by someone who was not a licensed physician and was not acting under the
   supervision of a licensed physician." Atrash. et aL, Legal Abortion m the United State*: Trends and
  Mortality. 33 Contemp. Ob. Gyn. 38.39 (ftb. 1990). But if any abortion is defined as "legal" merely if
   a physician is licensed and safety is arrribntad to this bet alone, then most abortions performed before 1973
   were, in effect, "legal abortions" as well. Tietze A Lewk, supra note 8, at 23; Calderone. supra note 8.

of Health and Human Services) and the Alan Guttmacher institute (AGI). a private
organization that historically was the research arm of Planned Parenthood.l66 There is
no federal abortion statistics reporting law.167 The CDC relies on voluntary reporting
and on reporting made to the individual state departments of health pursuant to state
statute. This is a patchwork compilation since abortion reporting laws vary from state
to state and some states have no reporting law in effect.168 Many states have attempted
to collect accurate medical data through confidential abortion reporting."9 Yet these
have been regularly struck down by the courts.170 Some providers may not report or
may underreport abortions, as well as deaths and complications, to state authorities.171
The CDC admits that it annually underreports abortions and abortion deaths and compli-
cations.172 As a result, the CDC reports are not entirely reliable. At the same time, the
AGI's ideological support for the broadest abortion rights has enabled it to collect abor-
tion sutistics directly from providers for the past 15 years.'73 But the providers have an
obvious interest in not releasing complete reports of deaths or complications. And these
data are apparently unavailable to the CDC and even less available to the public. As a

 130 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

 result, there is substantial reason to doubt the accuracy of currently cited national abor-
 tion statistics. However, because they are the only available national statistics, the fig-
 ures are common currency.

       This underreporting of abortion deaths and complications is problematic. If wom-
 en's health and well-being are truly served by "safe and legal abortions," then accurate
 statistics should confirm this. Abortion providers should have nothing to hide and noth-
 ing to fear from revelation of the truth. On the other hand, if women are maimed or
 killed by legal abortion, they need protective safeguards. Abortion advocates should be
 demanding comprehensive, nationwide reporting--open to public scrutiny--if only to
 substantiate their claim that legal abortions are safe.

       Nor do statistics support the argument that legal abortion is necessory to protect
 women's health. A profile compiled from the available data indicates that few abortions
 are performed for reasons of "medical necessity."l14 That is, abortion is rarely sought
because of a genuine health risk. The typical abortion patient today is white, single and
young and is seeking abortion for reasons other than serious health concern, rape or
incest.173 "[T]wo percent of all abortions in this country are done for some clinically
identifiable entity--physical health problem, amniocentesis, and identified genetic dis-
ease or something of that kind. The overwhelming majority of abortions . . . are per-
formed on women who for various reasons do not wish to be pregnant at this time."l76

       Abortion advocates are thus relying on inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statis-
tics to support their campaign to keep "safe" legalized abortion on demand. As dis-
cussed below, legal abortion is not necessarily safe for women (and obviously is not
"safe" for unborn children). Neither was illegal abortion the great killer of thousands
of women. Abortion is not needed to avoid death by childbirth. And rarely is it sought
for gen. ne reasons of medical necessity. Consequently, the proposition mat legal abor-
tion is needed to protect women's health rests on faulty assumptions.

B. Physical Effects and Legal, "Back Alky" Abortions
      Despite the clamor to "keep abortions safe and legal," evidence from the CDC's

own experts indicates that the incidence of abortion complications and even death is
serious:

           was being respected. At the end of two or three yens we might really know something

            The scope of the problem of abortion complications is large, both nu-
            merically and economically. For example, in 1977, nearly 100,000 women
            in the United Slates sustained complications of abortion, and 16 died
            . . . Excluding the indirect costs of lost productivity, the estimated direct
            cost of treating women who suffered complications in 1977 was over $22
            million.TM

 Deaths from legal abortion do occur. One study, by the CDC's own statistician relying
 on CDC data, concluded that there were 213 "legal abortion-related" deaths between
 1972 and 1985--an average of IS per year.17* Other studies report different totals for
 deaths of women from legal abortion.179

        Follow-up on other abortion complications is compounded by women's refusal to
 admit to the procedure, even when questioned confidentially. Former Surgeon General
 C. Everett Koop, in a January 9, 1989, letter to President Reagan, noted that reliable
 assessment of the statistical impact of abortion on women is made difficult by die fact
 that an estimated "50 percent of women [who] have had an abortion apparently deny
 having had one when questioned.""0

        Observers, independently of the pro-life movement, agree that die legalization of
 abortion has not eliminated "back-alley" abortions; it has merely moved them to Park
Avenue.'" Investigative journalist Debbie Sontag, in her expose of the Dadeland Fam-
ily Planning Center in Florida, wrote: "Even in the days of legal abortion, the back
alley persists--on a commercial street, in a medical building, with a front door, and
sometimes even with a state license."1*2

132 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

       Legal, "unsafe" abortions are often ignored by abortion activists. Yet reported
cases of maternal death and injury may indicate that more women die and are injured
from legal abortion than many are willing to admit.183 And countless more women are
physically injured, often permanently. Enormous damages have been levied against phy-
sicians for botched abortions.1*4 Countless more lawsuits are unreported because the
case is settled prior to trial or appeal. Anecdotal information and lawsuits reveal that
women suffer mild to severe physical injury and trauma from legal abortions, including
punctured uterus,1*9 incomplete abortions,"6 pelvic inflammatory diseaselt7 or stroke.1"

       Occasionally, abortion clinic abuses are publicized and investigated.1*9 In Chicago,
Illinois, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Better Government Association conducted an
undercover investigation in the late 1970s into the practices of Chicago abortion clinics.
This resulted in a 12-part series in the Sun-Times.190 Their joint investigation discovered
a dozen previously unreported deaths from legal abortion.'" In addition, they found
that abortions were performed by incompetent, unlicensed or unqualified physicians un-

 dcr unsterile conditions, on women who were not pregnant, without anesthesia or before
 anesthetics could take effect; results of pregnancy tests were intentionally withheld from
 patients; because of unsanitary conditions and haphazard clinic care, many women suf-
 fered debilitating cramps, massive infections and such severe internal damage that all of
 their reproductive organs were removed; because of assembly-line techniques and severe
 overcrowding, patients were forced to leave the recovery room while they were still in
 pain: medical records, including patients' vital signs, were fabricated or falsified; clinics
 failed to order critical postoperative pathology reports, and ignored the results or mixed
 up specimens; women received incompetent counseling by untrained staff who often
 were paid on a commission basis; unscrupulous sales techniques were used to pressure
 women into having abortions; and kickbacks were paid for abortion referrals. Some of
 the doctors investigated continued to practice.l92

                                                      IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 135

        It is apparent from abortion malpractice cases and from newspaper stories that the
 legalization of abortion has not eliminated abortion deaths and injuries or "back-alley
 abortions" and unskilled abortionists.2'4 Many of these physicians are still in business
 and still operate their clinics in major metropolitan areas.213 Because some abortion
 experts assert that the safety of abortion is directly related to the experience of the
 abortionist.216 one might think that^the physicians whb have been sued for malpractice
 have performed relatively few -abortions. Quite the opposite is true. Many of the phy-
 sicians who are sued in such cases have performed thousands of abortions.217 They
 continue to practice in the name of "choice." insulated from government regulation and
 largely immune from effective private redress.

        Despite official support for abortion from major medical organizations like the
 American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists, a strong and growing stigma against performing elective abortion exists among
doctors. Perhaps for this reason, the number of physicians willing to perform abortions

is declining.:i8 At the same time, the stigma diminishes the number of hospitals that
permit abortions, thereby increasing the extent to which abortions are performed in great
numbers in specialty abortion centers. Today, most abortions are performed in approx-
imately 800 specialty centers in the United States.219

       In many, clinics.^abortion counseling is either nonexistent or inadequate. Physicians
spend little time,' if*any, -with their patients, even if the patients are young girls.230
Bottom-line profitability controls'xnost abortion practice, and the physician is typically
paid per abortion, not for time spent in counseling.221 The situation was effectively
summarized by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her 1983 dissent in City of Akron v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health: "It is certainly difficult to understand how the
Court believes that the physician-patient relationship is able to accommodate any interest
that the State has in maternal physical and mental well-being in light of the fact that, the
record in this case shows that the relationship is nonexistent."222 As a practical matter,
for women, this means that an increasing percentage of abortions are performed in
assembly-line fashion by anonymous doctors who spend little time with their patients.

                                                     IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT* FOR WOMEN? 137

For the vast majority of women, the notion that abortion is "between a woman and her
physician' * is utterly a myth.

C. The Protection of Women's Health
      How are women, as health care consumers, to be protected from abortion medical

malpractice? In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's legalization of abortion on demand
in every state in 1973, many states tried to enact consumer protection laws, including
clinic regulations, informed consent requirements, waiting periods and confidential sta-
tistical data reporting requirements. All these were challenged immediately by abortion
activists and have largely been invalidated by the federal courts. Abortion advocate Dr.
Willard Cates has acknowledged that the judiciary "has influenced the practice of abor-
tion most profoundly"--more than the mass media, legislators or regulatory agen-
cies.223 As a result, abortion in America is a largely unregulated industry.224

     After Roe. many states enacted clinic regulations.229 However, court decisions have
effectively prevented the states from enforcing many of those regulations.226 This out-

come is affirmed by abortion advocates. In an increasingly familiar pattern, people who
call themselves pro-choice oppose clinic regulations, even for such blatantly abusive
places as the Florida Oadeland Family Planning Center. Full-time activist Janis Comp-
ton-Carr explained, "In my gut, I am completely aghast at what goes on at that place.
But I staunchly oppose anything that would correct this situation in law."227 In a recent
"60 Minutes" expose of the Hillview abortion clinic in Maryland, Meredith V i e i n
discovered that "Many pro-choice leaders knew about problems at Hillview, but didn't
want them publicized.":2S When confronted with the opposition of Barbara Radford,
executive director of the National Abortion Federation, Vieira concluded, "even though
those laws could make clinics safer, they [pro-choice leaders] usually fight them." Pro-
choice Maryland State Senator Mary Boergers found that her support of laws to make
clinics safer made her "the enemy" of the pro-choice movement. She accurately per-
ceived that "all arguments from the pro-choice community can become suspect."229

       Just as relevant to women's health as clinic regulations, and apparently just as
offensive to advocates of "choice," is fully informed consent.230 Since Roe v. Wade.

                                                      IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT* FOR WOMEN? 139

 many states have enacted informed consent requirements.231 The Supreme Court and
 lower federal courts have routinely struck down laws requiring the doctor to provide
certain information to women contemplating abortion.232

        The Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have also struck down even a
 brief, 24-hour waiting period before abortion.233 (In France, by contrast, a week-long
 "reflection period'* is required, as is a counseling session with a psychologist.234) These
laws, modeled after other consumer protections, have been regularly struck down in the
name of "women's choice." There seems to be an underlying fear that too much infor-
mation might lead a woman to choose childbirth over abortion. Ironically, the result of
judicial invalidation of virtually all abortion regulations is that women are forced to rely
on private enforcement--on their individual effort to shed their anonymity and initiate
a lengthy, emotionally draining lawsuit in court.

        Whether or not the Court reverses Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, it can at
least rectify some aspects of abortion exploitation. If the Court upholds the Pennsylvania
regulations, protections such as informed consent would be constitutional. As long as

 140 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

 abortion remains legal, women should be protected from its most obvious abuses. In-
 formation about health risks, coupled with a meaningful opportunity to evaluate abortion
 outside the stress and pressures of a for-profit abortion center, should be provided to
 every woman contemplating an abortion.

 D. RU486 as an Alternative to Surgical Abortion
        As abortion advocates have become more aware of the physical trauma and com-

 plications of surgical abortion, as well as the very public nature of clinics, they have
 sought an alternative means for aborting a pregnancy. In the past two years, increasing
 publicity has been given to the abortifacient RU486 (Mifepristone), the so-called French
 abortion pill, and its potential effect on women and abortion in the United States.233
The drug has also been touted as a treatment for brain tumors, but the benefits are minor
and results are preliminary.236 Congress has held hearings about the distribution of the
drug in the United States.237 It appears widely suggested, and believed, that RU486 is
an easy, safe, preferable solution to surgical procedures, such mat it will quickly replace
surgical abortion and make abortion a safe, easy, at-home experience. Abortion clinics
will become a thing of the past, and the accompanying demonstrations in front of clinics
will be eliminated. Women will no longer need doctors to perform abortions. It will be
a private matter, and no one will know the difference. The abortion issue will simply
evaporate from the lack of an identifiable target.23*

                                                      IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 141

       However, a review of the medical and popular literature based on the drug's use
in France suggests otherwise.-19 The process of using RU486 is more extensive and
cumbersome than commonly known and requires, in France, four trips to a clinic.240
First, the woman visits the clinic to have her pregnancy confirmed by a urine or blood
test and clinical examination. If pregnant, she is a candidate for using RU486, which is
most effective during the seventh week of pregnancy.241 The woman returns a week
later and is given a 600-mg. oral dose of RU486, which induces an abortion by inhib-
iting proper implantation or by inducing a sloughing from the uterine wall after implan-
tation.242 In short, the process induces a miscarriage with "heavy menstrual bleed-
ing."243 But because Mifepristone by itself is only 5 0 * to 85% effective,244 the woman
must return a third time for administration of a prostaglandin to induce uterine contrac-
tions. This allegedly increases the effectiveness rate to 95%.24S Nausea may set in be-
fore the prostaglandin is administered, and the prostaglandin may exacerbate the nausea.
The woman spends a few hours in a hospital bed. "A few women . . . expel [the
fetus] before coming in for the injection, most do so while at the hospital, and for some
it will happen later, at home."246 For some, the expulsion may be delayed at home as
long as five days.247 The woman must go to the clinic a fourth time, eight to twelve
days later. If the abortion is not complete, a surgical abortion must be performed.24*
Even with the combination of RU486 and a prostaglandin, there is still an incomplete
abortion rate of 3% to 4%, and a continued pregnancy rate of about 1%.249

      For most women, the process is like a very heavy menstrual period, with bleeding
lasting on average from six to 16 days. During this process, some women require an-
algesic shots for pain.290 The French inventor of RU486, Etienne-Emile Baulieu, warns
that, "In an out-patient setting, this method requires strict medical supervision in order
to monitor cases of aggressive blood loss,"231 which may continue for as much as three
weeks after the prostaglandin is taken. Consequently, Baulieu recommends that any

  distribution of RU486 be done only by gynecologists in clinics.^: Life magazine de-
  scribed the side effects this way: "The bleeding RU486 causes, the disagreeable cramps
  and nausea that sometimes results from the prostaglandin, and the extension of a process
  normally completed in a few traumatic hours over several emotionally taxing days. This
  last is the most surprising to those who expect the pill to be quick."253 Dorothy Wick-
 enden wrote in The New Republic. "There is no denying that RU486 is an eerie drug."254

        Even aside from the complexity of the process, the literature indicates that RU486
 is not the simple abortifacient that has been commonly thought. It is only effective for
 about a three-week period, between six and eight weeks of pregnancy.255 The American
 Medical Association, which supports RU486 research, agrees with the FDA ban on
 importing the drug, noting that RU486 "poses a severe risk to patients unless the drug
 is administered as part of a complete treatment plan under the supervision of a physi-
 cian." Z56 The side effects of the drug make it anything but easy and effortless.257 These
 side effects include incomplete abortion, heavy bleeding or hemorrhage, nausea and
 vomiting and abdominal pain. There is anecdotal evidence that RLJ486 is stressful and
 painful.258 For women with undetected tubal (ectopic) pregnancies, taking RU486 would
 not end the pregnancy; undetected continuation of the pregnancy might result in a rup-
 ture of the fallopian tubes.259 It is necessary to ensure that every woman returns after
 taking RU486 for the prostaglandin dosage; otherwise an incomplete abortion may re-
 sult.260 As a result, some researchers do not believe that RU486 will ever replace suc-
 tion abortions.

       The death of a French woman from RU486 was reported in April 1991.261 French
 authorities had previously "recommended against nonsurgical abortion in cases when
 the women are smokers or have heart problems, diabetes and high cholesterol."262 In

          Biema. supra note 234.  83. A 1990 memo signed by the French director general of health, the
   director of hospitals and the director of pharmacy and medication noted that the use of the prostaglandin
   Nalador with RU486 caused "serious undesirable side effects of the cardio-vascular type." The memoran-
   dum recommended that the method of use be scrupulously noted and that "training of personnel and the
   proper use of material are indispensable." The procedures included: 1) the woman must be in a prone
   position during and after administration of the drug for several hours; 2) cardiorespuatoryresuscitatorsmust

                                                      IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 143

 April 1991, shortly after the woman's death, the French Ministry of Health banned the
 use of RU486 for women who are regular smokers or who are older than 35.263

       RU486 has created a dilemma for abortion advocates who are also concerned about
 women's health. In addition to the risks from the procedure, the long-term effects are
 unknown. The drug may suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.364
 If RU486 is unsuccessful in aborting the pregnancy, although the effects on the fetus
 are uncertain.263 it may cause birth defects.266 It is not recommended either as a "mom-
 ing after" pill or as a "once a month" menses inducer,267 although NOW and the Fund
 for a Feminist Majority have promoted it as such.26* Also, it can cause "dysynchrony,"
 a phenomenon "in which a woman's ovulating and menstrual cycles become unlinked,"
 reducing the drug's effectiveness in terminating any pregnancy.269

       The National Women's Health Network "has serious qualms about introducing
 reproductive products onto the market without adequate testing."270 In contrast to ex-
 tensive testing with Norplant--a time-release contraceptive capsule placed in a woman's
arm and allegedly effective for up to five years that underwent over 20 years of re-
search--a coalition of NOW, Fund for a Feminist Majority, the Population Council and
Planned Parenthood is pushing to have RU486 approved by the FDA within four years.271
If protection of abortion availability were not the issue, one would expect aggressive
feminist concern about the health ramifications of RU486. One of the few pro-choice
feminist groups to question the safety of RU486 is the Institute on Women and Tech-
nology; it has been heatedly criticized by other pro-choice feminists.272 Abortion advo-
cates should still remember the devastation of the Dalkon shield and the first-generation
birth control pills. But they ignore, apart from moral or philosophical concerns, the
genuine health risks to American women. Their single-minded pursuit of aborrjon-on-
demand by any means belies any legitimate claim to represent the interests of American
women.

E. Psychological Effects
      Even if aborted women escape physical trauma or death, they have another hurdle

to overcome: damage to their psychological and emotional well-being. The psychologi-
cal impact of abortion may be even more hotly denied by feminists than are physical
complications. To admit that abortion causes guilt, remorse or regret violates the fun-
damental premise that abortion is a "first right." Margaret Liu McConnell, who had an
all-too-easy abortion in college, discovered too late: "For all the pro-choice lobby's talk
of abortion as a deep personal moral decision, casting abortion as a right takes the
weight of morality out of the balance. For, by definition, a right is something you need

 not feel guilty exercising."213 Precisely. If abortion is a "right," why does it feel so
 wrong?

         Abortion has long been recognized to have devastating effects on at least some
 women. There is evidence that the psychological effects of abortion on women were
 publicized in the middle of the last century.374 The contemporary debate over the psy-
 chological impact of abortion spans 30 years.273 Studies prior to the liberalization of
 abortion concluded that abortion had negative psychological consequences.276 Indeed,
 Dr. Mary Calderone stated in 1960, based on the 1955 conference of experts sponsored
 by Planned Parenthood: "I am mindful of what was brought out by our psychologists
 . . . that in almost every case, abortion, whether legal or illegal, is a traumatic expe-
 rience that may have severe consequences later on."277 But writings and research by
 abortion-rights advocates in the late 1960s concluded that abortion had neither negative
 nor positive psychological consequences.27* Later articles by abortion-rights advocates
 admitted that negative consequences do in fact occur.279 However, they minimized the
 impact by claiming that the psychological sequelae from abortion may be less than that
 following childbirth.280 Mary Zimmerman, a sociologist who interviewed women who
 had aborted, suggests that the abortion experience is not uniform for women: Neither
 the "abortion as crisis" view (by the antiabortion movement) nor the "abortion as
harmless" view (by those who favor abortion) fully explains the abortion experience.
These two views result in abortion being seen as an "either/or issue . . . either abortion

           One factor that may affect research outcome is that the attitudes of professional psychologisBt dra-

 is viewed as a crisis or not: either it constitutes a major disruption or it does not."211
 Women's responses vary.

       In any case, because no longitudinal studies have been conducted, the scientific
 reliability of all previously completed studies has been questioned.212 A recent article
 examined all studies published in English between January 1966 and April 1988 that
 "quantitatively examined psychological sequelae" from abortion through original em-
 pirical data.213 The authors questioned the scientific reliability of many of those studies.
 Validity is compromised when, for example, "systematic attrition occurs, the reliability
of an assessment instrument is unknown, or a sample size is too small to reliably gen-
eralize to the underlying population."2*4

       Despite the lack of comprehensive national statistics, abortion does affect individ-
 ual women deeply. Anecdotal evidence of negative reactions is plentiful.2*9 In her au-
 tobiography, actress Patricia Neal wrote of her abortion of Gary Cooper's child and of
 the trauma she suffered for 30 years thereafter.2*6 Sue Nathanson, in Soul Crisis, con-
 veyed the devastation of her abortion in a startling and direct way. She wrote of "the
 psychological descent into despair I made after the abortion and tubal ligation."2*7 She
 grieved on each anniversary of her abortion.2** Even five years after her abortion, she
 felt compelled to "acknowledge the reality and permanence of the pain of my loss. My
grief for my unborn fourth child, though perhaps different in quality than the grief I
 would have for any living child, is just as palpable."2*9

 146 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

           social change such as is involved in the legalization of abortion exacts
           severe personal costs from the women she studied. The legitimizing of
           abortion, followed by the provision of institutional settings where abor-
           tions are routinely obtainable--although not uniformly available--has not
          been accompanied by parallel changes in the moral definitions of abor-
          tion. Among many, abortion continues to be viewed as an immoral act.
          For the individuals involved in this study . . . the guilt feelings which
          result from the discrepancy between what is legally permissible and moral
          belief is the price which they must pay.*91

 It is ironic that so many women are opposed to or ambivalent about an act they also
 claim as their legal, fundamental right. Zimmerman observed that "the most dramatic
 trend remains that by far the majority of women studied (70%) reported that they had
 disapproved of abortion to some degree prior to their own experience with it."xn About
 half of the group Zimmerman interviewed were troubled in the first few weeks following
 their abortion.293 It is worth noting that the women Zimmerman studied had abortions
just two years after Roe. They grew up with abortion largely prohibited; few knew
 anything factual about abortion or had ever discussed it with anyone.294 However, even
for women who have no memory of the pre-Roe years, the moral uncertainty, ambiva-
lence and secrecy remain.299 Why?

       One reason may be the inescapably human nature of the fetus, as illuminated by
fetal photography and modern developments in medical science. Many women consid-
ering abortion have at least a general idea of what a developing fetus looks like.296
Scientific confirmation of the humanity of the fetus cannot be attributed to the "moral-
ists" in the pro-life movement or shrugged off as the survival of traditionalist or anti-
feminist morals. Medical care for the unborn child as a patient preceded the in utero
photography and technology in the 1960s--anu it will survive any demise of the pro-
life movement.297 Traditionally, concern for the fetus has been an essential aspect of
prenatal care, intended to promote the health of mother and child.291 That approach is

 reflected in current medical practice as well. The American College of Obstetricians and
 Gynecologists Ethics Committee, in their Opinion No. 55. states that the "current eth-
 ical position of the medical community is that a physician treating a pregnant woman in
 effect has two patients, the mother and the fetus, and should assess the risk and benefits
 attendant to each in advising the mother on the course of her treatment/'299

        A recent issue of Discovery magazine brought into popular view the latest devel-
 opments in fetal surgery and medicine that have been growing throughout the 1970s and
 1980s.300 It is now possible to care for the unborn child in utero at virtually every s a g e
 of pregnancy.301 In utero treatments have been performed successfully for hydrocepha-
 lus. hydrops fetalis associated with maternal Rh sensitization, congenital adrenal hyper-
 plasia. urinary tract malformation, congenital hydronephrosis. perinatal asphyxia and
congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.302 Intrauterine blood transfusions have been
 performed for a variety of fetal diseases.303 Fetal surgery has also been performed to
correct some fetal anomalies in utero by removing the fetus from the uterus, operating
and then replacing the fetus into the uterus,304 and to remove a dead fetal twin.305 These
medical developments reaffirm that the fetus is a human child, loved and cared for and
highly valued by her parents and society.

  148 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

  pies of medical ethics, will be promoted by physicians and sought out by parents, whether
  or not the pro-life movement disappears in this country.306 Not only activists in the
  pro-life movement but physicians outside that movement ask the same ethical question:
  How and why do we provide surgery and treatment for one unborn child while another
  unborn child--at the same gestational age and in better health--is legally aborted?307
  Medical technology is thus another factor highlighting the tension over abortion as a legal
  "right" and a moral "wrong." Women contemplating abortion are vulnerable to this
 tension.

        Not surprisingly, assessment of the psychological effects of abortion continues.
 Some accepted conclusions demand an appropriate response. One example is the fre-
 quent aborter--experts appear to agree that women who have multiple abortions suffer
 more.308 The rate of repeat abortions has risen over the past IS years and now stands at
 429b.309 Some women suffer "anniversary reactions" on the date of the abortion or the
 date of the predicted birth of die child.310 An extreme example of mental and emotional
 suffering is the woman who commits suicide after her abortion.3"

        The aftermath of abortion is detrimental for many, if not most, women. For some
 of them, the effects may be bom severe and long-lasting. As long as abortion is legal,
 women deserve to know about all possible risks before making any decision. These
 risks should give pause to those who espouse the position that abortion is an unqualified
 good, the "first right," "morally responsible," or "safe and easy."

M*'The more that parents actually see the fetus and T ^ T * "  a human fora, the more valuable will that
   fetus become in their eyes . . . [S]ince ultrasound is being more routinely used in obttetneal p n II*T and

F. Effects on Minor Women
       The impact of abortion on minor women can be particularly negative. Many of

 them are not sufficiently mature to receive and assimilate the information needed to
 make a life-impacting decision. These adolescents fluctuate back and forth between
dependence on the familial/parental community and the need for self-expression and
 individuation. Ironically, many adults reflect this same ambiguity in their attitudes toward,
 and descriptions of, teenagers and pregnancy. There is a great deal of public concern
 about "children having children." implying that 14- and 15-year-olds are too young to
 become mothers (although if they are pregnant, they already are mothers). On the other
hand, these same adults oppose parental involvement legislation that would promote
communication and assist these "children" in making responsible decisions about their
own children, claiming that the same 14- or 15-year-old--by virtue of her biological
ability to get pregnant--is sufficiently mature to make an independent decision to abort.

       The open bias toward abortion is clear. Abortion is invariably advocated as the best
choice for minors, even when it conflicts with significant feminine values. Why do some
feminists fight against another woman's ability and obligation to raise, rear and care for
her minor daughter in the context of the minor's abortion? When a daughter is in the
midst of a crisis pregnancy, the core values of feminism--connectedness, care, com-
munity--are implicated. The mother is connected to her daughter and also to her grand-
daughter. Her embrace is ample enough to encompass this tiny, vulnerable new member
of the family. Both mother and father of a minor daughter are expected to care deeply
for her and to prudently exercise their constitutional right to rear their child, along with
their obligations and responsibilities toward her.

      The need for parental connection with a minor daughter in a stressful time is sub-
stantiated by the social sciences and recent litigation concerning parental notice laws.
The scope of the problems of teen pregnancy and abortion is vast. Adolescent psychol-
ogy and targeted research into adolescent abortion provides evidence that elective abor-
tion uniquely impacts minors. Nearly 200,000 abortions are performed every year on
minors age 17 or younger, including more than 15,000 on girls 14 years old or younger.312
More than 40% of all teenagers with confirmed pregnancies obtain abortion.313 This is
60% higher than the abortion rate for teenagers in 1973, the first year of nationwide
legalized abortion.314

      Nearly 80% of all abortions performed on teenagers are done in abortion clinics.313
In these unfamiliar surroundings, minors often are furtive, frightened visitors subjected
to assembly-line techniques. One study of Minnesota found that, in 1982, four Minne-
sota abortion clinics performed 78% of the 5,082 abortions performed on minors under
19 years of age.316

  150 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

        Despite this high incidence of teen pregnancy and abortion, few family planning
 clinics have parental consent policies. Less than half of the abortion clinics nationwide
 require parental notice even for teenagers 15 years of age or younger, even feweriequire
 parental notification before performing abortions on minors age 16 or older.317 This
 drives a deeper wedge in what may be fragile parent-child communication; teenagers in
 crisis often feel unable to confide in their parents. In one survey, nearly half (45%) of
 the 1,170 teenager abortion patients interviewed admitted to getting an abortion without
 parental knowledge; this figure obviously could not include teenagers who denied the
 clandestine nature of their abortion.318

       Adolescence is a time of tremendous transition in the life of an individual. "Guid-
 ance is essential if the transition is to be made successfully and with minimum psycho-
 logical damage."319 There is enhanced risk of "replacement pregnancy" and multiple
 abortions for adolescents.320 Ambivalence and confusion regarding the abortion decision
 are even greater for adolescents. "The here and now of an abortion decision for adoles-
cents is more complicated than it is for most adult women."321 One researcher found

          [tjhe decision to have an abortion was not an easy one. One of the young
          women admitted getting off the table at the abortion clinic before the
          procedure began. Another was not told that she was having an abortion
          and was confused about what was occurring . . . Attitudes about the
          acceptability of abortion also demonstrate the ambivalence of many [ad-
          olescents! who had abortions. Looking back to the time before the abor-
          tion, less than one-half approved of abortion at that time . . . less than
          one-quarter approved of it after the abortion.322

One study found that "[ajlmost one third of the young women (31.8%) changed their
minds once or twice about continuing the pregnancy or having the abortion, 18% changed
their minds even more frequently, but 50% did not change their minds at all."323 An-

 other study confirms this ambivalence: "About one-quarter of women having a later
 abortion [defined as 16 or more weeks' gestation] said their delay was attributable (at
 least in part) to the long time they had needed to make the abortion decision."324

       Teenagers who choose abortion typically have more difficulty with the decision
 than pregnant teenagers who reach other decisions. They are also relatively uninformed.
 They typically talk with fewer people and receive substantially less counseling than
 pregnant teenagers who chose to keep the baby or place it for adoption.323 However,
 adolescents who choose abortion typically make that decision much more hastily (nine
 days) than teens who choose to keep the baby (56 days) or place it for adoption (more
 than 100 days).326

       There has been inadequate empirical study of the impact of parental notice of abor-
 tion statutes on minors and their abortions because the minimal ingredients for such a
 study--a simultaneous enforcement of a parental notice' law and state abortion data
reporting--have been in effect in only a handful of states over the past 20 years. Federal
or state courts have repeatedly enjoined parental notice and parental consent statutes.327
One notable exception is the Minnesota parental notice law, which was in effect from
August 1, 1981 until it was enjoined by a federal district court on March 2, 1986. The
notice requirement applied to teens below the age of 18.32S The federal district court in
Minnesota acknowledged that it was the first district court "ever to examine a parental
notification or consent substitute statute in actual operation."329 The experience of Min-
nesota during the four and one-half years that its parental notice of abortion law was in

   heavily on teens ages 18 to 19 who would have recently been subject to the law; somewhat less on women
   ages 20 to 24; and least on women ages 25 to 54. The notice law itself does not define "minor" by age,
   and thus it is possible that there was some confusion as to who. among 17- to 19-year-olds, was covered
   by the law. Moreover, some teens who gave birth at 18 might have been 17 at the time they became
   pregnant and thus were directly affected by the law. Those who were 18 or 19 in 1983-1986 were subject
   to the law in 1981, and the group as a whole could reasonably have been i**f*r~4 by the law through

  152 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

 effect gives some indication of the positive effect of parental notice of abortion laws on
 minors.330

        The data collected by the Minnesota Department of Health tell a broader public
 health story--not only about those Minnesota teens who aborted (.60% in 1982) but
 also about those who never got pregnant (98.7%) and those who carried their children
 to term (.66%). The department's data demonstrate that the notice law is reasonably
 related to protecting the health of minor women because it requires parental notice
 without causing any increased health problems for minors and, in fact, possibly de-
 creases adolescent pregnancy and abortion rates without causing increased birth rates.
 There is apparently no evidence of even a single report of child abuse caused by the
 parental notification law or a single report of medical complications caused by the law,
 or a single case of parental prevention or coercion of an abortion.331 This is an extraor-
 dinary benefit for teens in Minnesota.

       The data show that pregnancies for Minnesota preteens and teens, ages 10 to 17.
 declined between 1981 and 1986 while the notice law was in effect. The number of
 pregnancies in mis age group increased by 9.0 percent between 1975 and 1980 Mad fell
 by 27.4 percent from 1980 to 1986. In this age group, the highest number of adolescent
 pregnancies occurred in the year before the notice law went into effect. For the 18-19
 age group, pregnancies increased 27.8 percent between 1975 and 1980 andfell by 33.8
 percent between 1980 and 1986.

       The department's data also show that abortions for preteens and teens, ages 10 to
 17, declined between 1980 and 1986 while the notice law was in effect. Abortions in
 this age group increased 54.4% from 1975 through 1980 mi fell by 33.6% from 1980
 to 1986. For the eighteen-to-nineteen age group, abortions grew markedly between 1975
and 1980 before decreasing between 1980-1986. Abortions rose 92.3% between 1975
and 1980 before falling 29.8% between 1980 and 1986.

       Finally, it might be speculated mat if a parental notice law caused abortions to fall
for teens, births would increase, but the Minnesota data show just the opposite. Births
for girls ages 10 to 17 declined while the notice law was in effect. Births dropped 18.7%
from 1975 to 1980, but they continued to drop 20.3% from 1980 to 1986. For the 1 8 -
 19 age group, births increased by 4.0% from 1975 to 1980 but decreased by 36.6%
from 1980 to 1986.

      The rates of teen pregnancies, abortions and births also fell during the four and
one-half years that the parental notice law was in effect.932 The pregnancy rate for the
10-17 age group rose from 12.7 (12.7 per 1,000) in 1975 to a high of 15.6 in 1980,
the year before the notice law took effect, and then declined to a low of 11.3 in 1983
and 12.4 in 1986. Thus, even though the population of 10- to 17-year-olds declined
between 1975 and 1986, the pregnancy rate declined as well, by 20.5% between 1980

 and 1986. The pregnancy rate for the 18-19 age group rose substantially from 75.5
 (75.5 per 1000) in 1975 to a high of 98.5 in 1980. the year before the notice law went
 into effect, but then fell after 1980 to 96.0 in 1981 and to 73.5 in 1986. below the 1975
 level. Thus, again, even though the population in Minnesota for the 18-19 age group
 fell between 1976 and 1986, the pregnancy rate for 18- to 19-year-olds declined 25.4%
 between 1980 and 1986.

       The abortion rate also declined. The abortion rate for the 10-17 age group rose
 from 4.9 in 1975 to a high of 8.4 in 1980 and then fell 27.4% percent between 1980
and 1986 for 10- to 17-year-olds. The abortion rate also fell for the 18-19 age group.
The abortion rate rose from 20.4 in 1975 to a high of 40.1 in 1980 and then fell 4.8%
to 38.20 in 1981 and a further 16.8% to a low of 31.80 in 1986. The abortion rate for
 18- to 19-year-olds thus rose 96.6% between 1975 and 1980 and fell 20.7% between
 1980 and 1986.

       Finally, the birth rate fell for 10- to 17-year-olds and for 18-to 19-year-olds. The
birth rate for the 10-17 age group fell from 7.8 in 1975 to 7.2 in 1980, but it continued
to fall to 7.0 in 1981, to a low of 5.8 in 1983 and then to 6.3 in 1986. The birth rate
for 10- to 17-year-olds thus fell 7.7% between 1975 and 1980 but fell 12.5% between
1980 and 1986. The birth rate for the 18-19 age group rose from 54.6 in 1975 to 58.0
in 1980 but fell to 57.4 in 1981 and to a low of 41.5 in 1986. Thus, the birth rate for
18-to-19 year-olds rose 6.2% from 1975 to 1980 but fell 28.4% between 1980 and 1986.

      What does this public health story say for young women in Minnesota? The com-
parison of the pregnancy, abortion and birth rates in Minnesota between 1975-1980 and
1981-1986 supports the conclusion that the notice law effectively caused a decrease in
the pregnancy rate in those years. This cannot be absolutely proven because this statis-
tical study did not control for all other possible factors. However, since the abortion
rate fell 27.4% for 10- to 17-year olds and 20.7% for 18- to 19-year-olds, while the
birth rate throughout Minnesota simultaneously fell 12.5% for 10- to 17-year-oUs and
28.4% for 18- to 19-year-olds, the pregnancy rate must have also declined, as the data
confirm, supporting the conclusion that the notice law in fact changed adolescent behav-
ior. In other words, since it seems undisputed that the notice law directly decreased
abortion rates, while birth rates simultaneously decreased, the law must have decreased
abortion rates by affecting pregnancy rates. Decreased unwed pregnancy for young women
means decreased abortion and childbirth at a vulnerable age and time in their lives. A
law that positively deters young women from pregnancy and abortion benefits young
women.

V. Does Legal, Economic, and Social Equality for Women Hinge on Roe v. Wade?

As noted above, many feminist abortion advocates view abortion rights as the funda-
mental basis for all other freedoms. Abortion on demand is seen as necessary not only
for freedom from male sexual oppression and domination,333 but also as a legal basis

   Radical feminist Catherine MacKinnon believes abortion is an essential tool for women's liberation:

          A pregnant woman is the reincabon of male sexuality. Aggression, strength, and potency
          have triumphed over vulnerability, softness, and passivity. Pregnancy is the
          of male dominance and female cubmissiveneu. A similar objectincation of children from
          the male epistemology. in which children are defined in relation to male issues of potency,
          of continuity as a compensation for mortality, of the thrust to embody themselves or the

  154 ABORTION. MEDICINE. AND THE LAW

  for other economic, educational and social rights. Thus, from this perspective, the legal
  guarantee of readily available abortion, whether based on a right of privacy or some
  other constitutional claim, is paramount. Roe v. Wade must be preserved in order to
  preserve and promote the development of female equality. In the face of often vocifer-
  ous argument, it is worthwhile to examine the foundation for women's legal, social and
 economic rights.

        Roe is rarely cited as a precedent for women's rights in any area other than abor-
 tion.334 Virtually all progress in women's legal, social and employment rights over the
 past 30 years has come about through federal or state legislation and judicial interpre-
 tation wholly unrelated to and not derived from Roe v. Wade.335 Many specific measures
 to advance women's rights over the past 30 years have been the result of congressional
 action. These developments began at least a decade before Roe. Congress passed the
 Equal Pay Act in 1963,33* Tide VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964337 and the Preg-
 nancy Discrimination Act amendments in 1978.33* Additional workplace protections have
 been added. For example, in 1978 the first appellate court held that sexual harassment

            image of themselves, also underlies the issue of abortion. As MacKinnon notes: 'the idea
           that women can undo what men have done to them on this level seems to provoke insecurity
           sometimes bordering on hysteria.' Abortion, to MacKinnon, is a threat to the *TMH--I--i
           premise of male sexuality: the * i ! -- *   of female sexuality.

 ** Although Roe has been cited in almost 100 cases by [the Supreme Court], and in more than

            1.000 cases by other federal and sole conns, these citations, outside the context of abortion
           regulation, have been largely superfluous to theissues decided in those cases. Hundreds of
           the cited cases involve some regulation of abortion; this body of law will understandably
           be altered by die reversal of Roe. Of the remaining cases, however, very few, if any, could
           not be resolved by principles other than those pronounced in Roe.

                 Westlaw indicates that Roe has been cited in 99 opinions or summary dispositions by
           this Court. Of these. 18 were cases involving state regulation of abortion, or limitations on
           abortion funding. Eleven more were summary dispositions, issued shortly after Roe revers-
           ing and remanding cases to lower courts in light of Roe. In 13cases. Roe was cited for its

 in the workplace was sex discrimination, prohibited by Title VII (equal employment
 opportunity).339 Two years later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOQ

 adopted similar guidelines, prohibiting sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimina-
 tion.340 State agencies, as well as federal and state courts, have followed the EEOC's
 Guidelines' basic definition of sexual harassment.341 Title IX of the Education Amend-

 ments of 1972 prohibits sexual discrimination against women in sports in federally funded
 schools.342 Sex equity in education was established by the Women's Educational Equity
 Act of 1974343 and expanded by the Women's Educational Equity Act of 1984.344 The

 Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 prohibits sex discrimination in credit
 practices.343 Other developments have come about through presidential order. For ex-

 ample. Executive Order No. 11,246 ensures equal opportunity in federal employ-
 ment.346 Progress has been facilitated simultaneously by state legislation. Some states
have equal pay laws;347 fair employment laws barring sex discrimination;34* prohibi-

 practices332 and public accommodations.3" States have also enacted legislation targeted
 at domestic violence.354 In the realm of education, "[t]ne states too have been active
 partners in developing programs to achieve educational equity."333 At least 14 states
 have laws modeled on the federal Title IX.356

       Legislative progress was subsequently buttressed by judicial interpretation of the
 equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. Prior to 1971 the Supreme Court
 exercised great deference toward legislatively established gender classifications.397 In
 1971 the Court first held that sex discrimination violates the equal protection clause in
 Reed v. Reed.35' Other similar decisions have followed, striking down some gender
 classifications.339

      Few, if any, of these legal and legislative developments rest on Roe v. Wade. Some
 of these events preceded Roe v. Wade. And the judicial decisions rely on interpretations
 of congressional or state policy-making, rather than on Roe.

      The single-minded pursuit of abortion rights has arguably sidetracked progress on
the legal, economic and social issues that are most important to most women: equal

                                                       IS ABORTION THE "FIRST RIGHT" FOR WOMEN? 157

 pay, day care, maternity leave, job discrimination. Minority women in particular are
 concerned about issues that directly affect the health and welfare of their families: access
 to education, adequate health care and safe neighborhoods for their children.360 Despite
 the "success" of achieving freely available, legal abortion, women's economic rights
 in domestic-relations law have not progressed; in fact, the opposite has been true. "Di-
 vorce reform," which was achieved in the name of equality, has been devastating for
 women. The "feminization of poverty" is a reality caused, at least in part, by modern
 divorce laws.361 With no-fault divorce laws in 43 states, women have suffered more
 than with previous divorce laws. No-fault laws eliminate alimony and force the sale of
 the family home. There is a 73% drop in the standard of living for the wife and children,
 and a 42% increase for the husband.362 The presence of "abortion rights" is irrelevant
 at best, and at worst, has paralleled women's economic decline.

       There may be countless other ways that Roe and the expansion of the abortion
 doctrine have been ineffective and irrelevant in advancing those issues and meeting the
 needs that are most important to women. The full impact on women and society may
 not be known for several generations.

                                                VI. Conclusion

 Abortion as the "first right" for women runs counter to all the principles of feminism
and to the basic human value of protecting the weak and defenseless. By promoting the
death of one's own offspring as a positive "good," abortion violenu contradicts the
core values that are the very essence of a \ Oman's being: nurturance, care, compassion,
cooperation, indusivity, community and connectedness. It denies basic civil rights to
an entire class of prenatal human beings. Women, who so recently have begun to achieve
equality and opportunity, should be the first to recognize that the diminution of the
rights of other human beings threatens the rights of women as well.

       The abortion privacy doctrine has spawned a great host of ills for women without
remedying any of the real historical injustices against them. Abortion on demand has
isolated women, subjected them to coercion, maimed their bodies and wounded their
psyches. The abortion-on-demand mentality that Roe v. Wade, more than anything else,
fostered has not truly benefited women, whether examined from the perspective of women's
self-perception, the psychological and physical consequences of abortion, the impact on
minors or the relationships between women, their families and their communities. No

                         STATEMENT OF ROSA CUMARE

  Ms. CUMARE. Distinguished Senators, it is a great honor and
privilege to address you today on this historic occasion of the con-
firmation hearings for the second woman to be nominated to a seat
on the Supreme Court.

  When my parents and I emigrated to the United States in 1965
from Venezuela via Holland, we never conceived of the notion that
I would one day be speaking my mind to the U.S. Senate on a sub-
ject of such importance.

  But then, ever since my arrival in this country, I have enjoyed
much that America has to offer, from an undergraduate in legal
education at the University of Southern California to a graduate
education at Harvard University. That education led to a job at
Munger, Tolls & Olson, one of the leading law firms in Los Ange-
les, and the training I received there recently enabled me to carry
out the American dream of going into business for myself, by hang-
ing out a shingle with a partner to practice labor and employment
law.

  I am also privileged to serve as a member of the board of direc-
tors of Holy Family Counseling and Adoption Services, the largest
private nonprofit adoption agency in southern California.

  I am deeply grateful for the many opportunities America has
given me, because, before coming to this country, my family had
personally experienced the consequences of having our options cur-
tailed by an intrusive government.

  I hope you will consider my presence here today, among other
things, as a reminder of our Nation's diversity, of backgrounds and
beliefs, and remember that respect for each person's uniqueness
lies at the heart of our democracy.

  As a woman and lawyer, I admire Judge Ginsburg for her
achievements over the years and the personal qualities she dem-
onstrated here before this committee. She has been rightly lauded
as a pioneer in developing our current laws dealing with equal pro-
tection and gender discrimination.

   Unfortunately, Judge Ginsburg's pioneering efforts appear to be
inextricably linked to her view that women must have an unfet-
tered right to abortion. In fact, Judge Ginsburg's words, when
speaking of the so-called right to choose, demonstrate that she con-
siders a woman's ability to abort her child a precondition to equal-
ity. During these very hearings, she said, in response to Senator
Brown's questioning,

   I said on the equality side of it that it is essential to a woman's equality with
man that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling.

  Judge Ginsburg's writings underscore this thesis. Her now fa-
mous article in the North Carolina Law Review quoted with ap-
proval scholarly commentary that "solidly linked abortion prohibi-
tions with discrimination against women," and viewed the conflict
in the abortion issue as--

   Not simply one between a fetus' interests and a woman's interests narrowly con-
ceived, nor is the overriding issue State versus private control of a woman's body
for a span of 9 months. Also in the balance is a woman's autonomous charge of her
full life course, her ability to stand in relation to man, society and the State as an
independent self-sustaining equal citizen.

                                                   504

  Why aren't we all shocked and outraged by these views? Why is
Judge Ginsburg hailed for being a moderate jurist? The implica-
tions of her statements are clear: Unless women are also able to
put an end to life, they cannot be regarded as equals in our society.
Only by being legally permitted to do violence to their bodies and
their children, can women achieve full human dignity. Women will
not achieve parity with men until they are able to negate their an-
atomical differences.

  These notions appear firmly based on Judge Ginsburg's accept-
ance of the idea that child-bearing is a burden and not a blessing,
that child-rearing poses problems, instead of being a source of joy,
and that women, but not men, are disadvantaged by what their
bodies do.

  Moreover, Judge Ginsburg regards as closed the question of
whether men who beget children have any rights in the matter of
bringing those children into the world. One is led to wonder if her
gender discrimination personal autonomy analysis would lead her
to strike down State laws that require men to support children
they do not want.

  My life, unlike Judge Ginsburg's, has not been blessed with the
love and support of a husband and children, so I cannot testify
from personal experience about the rewards of such a life. But I
can tell you that I consider my potential ability to bear children to
lie at the core of my being and establishes my place in the human
family.

  I can also tell you, based on my association with Holy Family
Adoption Services, that many men and women consider their lives
diminished because they cannot have children. If I thought it was
true that, in America, the potential to become a mother is regarded
as a handicap to be overcome before I could be considered the equal
of a man, I would be far less grateful for being an American.

  I believe, however, that one of the primary reasons we don't all
cry out at the horror of Judge Ginsburg's expressed opinions and
their consequences is that they have been drummed into our ears
by the media and by powerful, though unrepresentative women's
organizations.

  One of the reasons I have come all the way across the country
to be here today is to tell you that an organization like California
Women's Lawyers, which will appear before you shortly, does not
represent the interests of over 30,000 women attorneys in the State
of California, as I believe they claim. California Women Lawyers
does not represent me, nor many women lawyers who believe, as
I do, that abortion kills innocent human life.

  It is a sad fact of my professional life that I and other pro-life
women and men cannot in good conscience join California Women
Lawyers nor the American Bar Association, the Los Angeles Coun-
ty Women's Law Association and similar legal societies, because of
their pro-choice policies.

  Ironically, many of the same women who fought in the name of
equal rights to open up formerly all male bastions of the legal pro-
fession are now discriminating against another group, those who
are pro-life. In the name of equality, these women impose conform-
ity. To my way of thinking, that is profoundly un-American and
antidemocratic. Worse yet, I suspect these groups laud themselves
                                                505

for having advanced the woman's cause, because they are pro-
choice.

  I know that my name came up as a participant in these proceed-
ings, because I was one of the women lawyers who actively opposed
the pro-choice position adopted in recent years by the L.A. County
Bar Association and the ABA. I argued then, as I am arguing now,
that these organizations do nothing to help women lawyers in their
everyday lives as lawyers, when they declare that they are pro-
choice.

  This position does not address the problems of juggling home and
career or the discriminatory attitudes of male judges and col-
leagues who measure achievement and success solely in male terms
of power and victory, or the scarcity of women as law professors,
judges and managing partners. Instead, it pays lipservice to the
cause of women, while providing women lawyers with no tangible
support or gains.

  Likewise, to the extent you, as Senators, are inclined to confirm
Judge Ginsburg, because she appears to represent women, without
careful consideration of precisely what is implied by the particular
views she holds of women's place in society, you will not be advanc-
ing the cause of American women. Instead, I regret to say you will
be granting lifelong authority to a woman who believes we should
deny our womanhood to be an equal with men.

  Because Judge Ginsburg holds this view, I oppose her nomina-
tion and urge you to vote against confirmation.

  Thank you.
  Senator HATCH [presiding]. Nellie.

                    STATEMENT OF NELLIE J. GRAY
  Ms. GRAY. I am Nellie Gray, president of March for Life Edu-
cation and Defense Fund.
  We are deeply concerned and have been for more than 20 years
now about the value and dignity of life in America. What I see is
certainly that abortion is the most visible sign of a callous dis-
regard for our right to life. Abortion is murder. Yet, Mr. Chairman,
after listening to some of the hearings this week, I come to you
today in strong opposition to the confirmation of Judge Ginsburg
as a Justice of our Supreme Court, because she has, by her own
testimony, shown a personal and professional inclination to factors
which disqualify any American as one to decide the fate of human
beings; namely, she has shown prejudice against a whole class of
innocent human beings. She has shown privilege for criminal be-
havior of women. She has shown a fatal error of both fact and law,
and this whole coverup of this terrible error about murdering inno-
cent children.
  I want to address the prejudice and also the privilege first. What
I see is that no American and no nominee to the Supreme Court
may announce with impunity that any member in a whole class of
innocent human beings is a nonperson who is the subject of delib-
erate killing by another human being. Yet, the nominee seeking
confirmation by this committee indicated in her testimony that she
is prejudiced against preborn human beings. She has elevated her
prejudice to the right of a pregnant mother to murder her own
                                                   506

child. This open and notorious show of prejudice alone disqualifies
this nomination for any official position.

  Before considering this nominee further, I think the committee
might ask also the nominee to open eyes and heart and mind and
ears to the simple fact, not an opinion, but the simple fact of the
humanity of each preborn child. To deny that a preborn human
being is in existence at fertilization is either intellectual dishonesty
or culpable ignorance.

  Information on the humanity of a child is in popular shows and
magazines, and the committee and the nominee could take notice
of that fact. A unique human being is in existence when the fa-
ther's sperm fertilizes the mother's ovary. Abortion is murder of
that individual human being in existence.

  The elements of murder are here, first, the criminal act of one
human being killing another human being, and, second, the crimi-
nal intent of deliberately killing an innocent human being. Abor-
tion is not merely to terminate a pregnancy. Abortion is to deliver
a dead baby. Thus, the right to life of each human being in exist-
ence at fertilization must be protected by the laws of the United
States, without any exception. And the Supreme Court, in its foot-
note 54 of Roe v. Wade made it very clear that it is inconsistent
and untenable for society and its laws to treat the murder of a pre-
born child as a crime of less degree than the murder of a born
human being.

  I was particularly struck by the privilege that the nominee was
asking for a woman. She has stated, in effect, that only a woman
shall decide whether or not to have an abortion. That means a
pregnant mother shall decide whether or not to hold her innocent
child captive and deliver the child to a killer at the abortatorium.
This is advocating raw privilege based on female gender, and not
equal rights for male and female.

  The nominee has demonstrated and spelled out her avowed devo-
tion to privilege for females, her preference for the equal rights
amendment, her tendency to be acutely aware of sex discrimina-
tion, not for males, but only for females.

  The nominee has openly declared that she has prejudged that the
abhorrent behavior of murder, when decided to be perpetrated by
a pregnant mother against her preborn child, is privileged behav-
ior, but the same abhorrent behavior decided by a male would not
be privileged.

  Women libbers have been unfortunately successful in intimidat-
ing the males not to really take issue with the women libbers. It
is extremely important now that men no longer wimp out with the
women libbers and let them have their way on this ugly and radi-
cal behavior. Otherwise, men will have denied themselves the
rights of fatherhood and the responsibility to protect their own
lives and born and preborn sons and daughters.

  She has also shown a discrimination against only for, in favor of
the born females to treat preborn, male and females, as property.
I see nothing in any of her testimony or her indications of a respon-
sibility that she is looking for from born females. In addition, data
suggest that this female privilege has developed into an ugly area
of genocide.
                                      507
  One example is the District of Columbia, where almost 80 per-
cent of the abortions for DC residents were suffered by black preg-
nant mothers. Would this be tolerated, if it was occasioned by any-
thing other than women libbers' ugly demand for privileges?
  There is an equal care and protection for both mother and the
child. The pregnant mother and the physician are the natural pro-
tectors of a child. But the nominee has set up an unnatural and
a needless conflict between a pregnant mother and her child. After
all, the mother doesn't own the right to life of anyone. No one owns
the right to life of another human being, and the rights of the
mother and the child are compatible and are not in conflict, and
the government have a valid interest in protecting the life of both
the mother and the child.
  The nominee has shown a fatal error of fact in not recognizing
the human being as a human being, a fatal error of law in not rec-
ognizing that it is a crime against humanity, as enunciated by the
Nuremberg Trials, to kill human beings. Abortion is not legal, and
the Supreme Court did not make it so with Roe v. Wade. Rather,
the Supreme Court is bound by the principles of the Nuremberg
tribunal, which talks about the crimes against humanity and states
that individual persons and governments are responsible for these
crimes against humanity, of which abortion and genocide are in-
cluded.
  There is a big coverup, also, about the evil of abortion, and I
would like the committee to ask the nominee some important ques-
tions: Can the woman be just a little bit pregnant? What really
goes on behind the closed doors of an abortion chamber? Why do
press and media not show us what abortion looks like?
  But the women libbers have used euphemisms to try to coyer up,
and so what we have is the unfortunate situation of a nominee to
the Supreme Court asking for the privilege of killing the innocent
children. Our country suffered with other classes of people, namely,
the slaves, and the holocaust. And now, as we saw from the mes-
sage at the Holocaust Museum, this must never happen again, and
people do not stand by while these errors of both fact and law go
on. Our country cannot suffer any more the slaughter of the inno-
cence.
  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I ask respectfully
not to confirm the nomination before you.

                                      SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

                                                           in opposition to the
                    Confirmation of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Justice of the Supreme Court

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee,

              I am Nellie J. Gray, President of MARCH FOR LIFE Education and Defense Fund, which is guided
         by our Life Principles. We are a non-profit, non-partisan and non-sectarian corporation, with the purpose
         of assuring that our laws shall protect the unalienable and paramount right to life of each bom and prebom
         human being in existence at fertilization. NO EXCEPTIONS! NO COMPROMISE! We are an
         organization of volunteers, working throughout the United States.

              I come before this Senate Judiciary Committee at this time because of our long-standing and deep
         concern that there is a depreciation of the inherent value and dignity of innocent human beings, and that
         this depreciation is supported by actions of even our government through die Executive, Legislative and
         Judicial Branches. Yet, all Branches of our Federal Government have the power and authority to reaffirm
         the unalienable right to life of each human being in existence at fertilization, and then to act to assure that
         this paramount right is protected by our Constitution and Statutes.

              In America today, the most prominent visible sign of callous disregard for our right to life is through
         abortion. Abortion is murder - bom human beings deliberately killing a prebom human being in
         existence at fertilization. Abortion terminates a child's life - not merely a mother's pregnancy.

              Therefore, Mr. Chairman, after listening to some of the hearings this week, I come to you today in
         strong opposition to confirmation of Judge Ginsburg as a Justice of our Supreme Court, because she has,
         by her own testimony, shown a personal and professional inclination to factors which disqualify any
         American as one to decide the fate of human beings, namely, (1) prejudice against a class of innocent
         human beings, (2) privilege for criminal behavior of women, (3) fatal error of fact and law, (4) cover-up
         of right fact and law, and (5) disrespect for the history of America which has bought freedom at home
         and abroad with the blood of patriots. And, I conclude with (6) what to do now.

                                           I. PREJUDICE

                               Against A Whole Class of Innocent Human Beings

     No American, and no nominee to the Supreme Court, may announce with impunity that any member
in a whole class of innocent human beings is a non-person who is the subject of deliberate killing by
another human being. Yet, the nominee seeking confirmation by this august Committee indicated in her
testimony that she is prejudiced against prebom human beings, and has elevated her prejudice to the
"right" of a pregnant mother to murder her own prebom child. This open and notorious show of
prejudice, alone, disqualifies this nominee for any official position.

     Mr. Chairman, before considering this nominee further, the Committee must open its eyes, head, heart,
and ears to the simple fact - not opinion - of the humanity of each prebom child.

     I say it is simple - and I truly mean that To deny that a prebom human being is in existence at
fertilization is either intellectual dishonesty or culpable ignorance. Information on the humanity of a
prebom child is available in popular literature and on TV shows, of which this Committee can take notice.

     A unique human being comes into existence when the father's sperm fertilizes the mother's ovum.
The genetic code is set, and the preborn human being, in the natural habitat of the mother's womb, grows
until birth, and then grows from infancy throughout a natural continuum of life. At no period of that life
span is that human being more or less human that at fertilization.

     Abortion is murder ~ that is, the elements are present: (1) the criminal act of one human being killing
another human being, and (2) the criminal intent of deliberately killing an innocent human being.
Abortion is not merely to terminate a pregnancy, it is to deliver a dead baby.

     Thus, the right to life of each human being in existence at fertilization must be protected by the laws
of the United States. NO EXCEPTIONS! NO COMPROMISE! The Supreme Court made it clear in
footnote 54 of Roe v. Wade that it is inconsistent and untenable for a society and its laws to treat the
murder of a prebom child as a crime of less degree than the murder of a bom human being.

     To deny facts and embrace inconsistency about human life is to pre-judge mat an innocent prebom
human being is property. Our country has suffered that error before in our history, as indicated, below.

                           n. PRIVILEGE FOR BORN FEMALE

     Not Equal Rights for Male and Female, Born and Preborn, But Privilege for Born Females

    The nominee has stated, in effect, that only a woman shall decide whether or not to have an abortion
- that is, only a pregnant mother shall decide whether or not to hold her innocent prebom child captive
and deliver her child to the paid killer at the abortatorium. This is advocating raw privilege based on
female gender and not equal rights for male and female. The nominee has demonstrated and spelled out
her avowed devotion to privilege for females, her preference for the Equal Rights Amendment, and her
tendency to be acutely aware of possible "sex discrimination'' against females - not males. All of this
strongly suggests that the nominee has a long-standing inability to judge fairly on the basis of gender.

    The nominee has openly declared that she has pre-judged that the aberrant behavior of murder, when
decided to be perpetrated by a pregnant mother against her prebom child, is privileged behavior, but the
same aberrant behavior decided by a male would not be privileged. Women libbers have been successful
in intimidating men to let females have their unprincipled way, even for killing prebom children.
Observation over the past several years indicates that women libbers gained this remarkable achievement
by aggressive and ugly behavior to put-down men, by loud name-calling, such as "male chauvinist pigs,"
and a hate-filled attitude toward men, women, prebom children, family, church, government, army,
country, and much else. It is extremely important mat men no longer wimp-out before the women libbers'

Jul 23^3; NJGray, Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee - Judge Ginsburg.  . 2 .
                                   510

     onslaught of ugly and radical behavior. Otherwise, men will have denied themselves their rights of
     fatherhood and their responsibility to protect their own wives and bom and prebom sons and daughters.

         Further, the nominee has declared that she has pre-judged to extend the raw "privilege" of
     abortion/murder to bom females and treats prebom male and female human beings as property at the
     disposal of her favored and privileged bom female. There is no indication that a bom female has serious
     responsibility to the well-being of self, child, family, husband, law, order, or society.

         In addition, data seem to suggest that the female privilege has developed into the ugly area of
     genocide. One example is the District of Columbia, where almost 80% of all abortions for DC residents
     were suffered by black pregnant mothers. Would this be tolerated if occasioned by anything other than
     women libbers ugly demands for "privileges."

EQUAL CARE AND PROTECTION FOR BOTH MOTHER AND PREBORN CHILD
         The pregnant mother and physician are the natural protectors of a prebom child. But, the nominee

     has set up an unnatural and needless conflict between a pregnant mother and her prebom child, whereby
     the mother would have sole decision over the right to life of her prebom child. The nominee tries to
     establish an untenable notion that a pregnant mother "decides" about the life or death of her prebom child,
     even though no one owns the right to life of another human being. With a pregnancy, there are two
     human beings, each of whom has an imnHnMf. right to life vested in each fawnm being at fertilization.
    These rights are compatible and are not in conflict Nor does the protection of the right to life of a
    prebom child establish self-defense for the pregnant mother. And, the government has a valid interest in
     protecting the life of both the pregnant mother and her prebom child, because murder is well-established
     as such anti-social behavior that society must protect itself against this felonious crime.

         There is no justification for deliberately kiling a preborn child. For the record, I shall submit a longer
     statement on "Equal Care for both Mother and Prebom Child."

PREJUDICE IS DISQUALIFYING
         This nominee has indicated her determination to pre-judge, by which she shall extend the raw

     "privilege" of murder to a pregnant mother. In doing so, she has demonstrated her inability to view fairly
     a case before her on the facts and evidence of record, which prejudice is totally inconsistent with basic
    qualifications for any Judge or Justice. And, when the prejudice would result in attempting to give license
     to the deliberate killing of an innocent prebom child, die nominee's qualifications are fatally flawed.

                            m. FATAL ERROR OF FACT AND LAW

                                  Abortion is Not Respectable and is Not "Legal"
              Not Learning from History that Prejudice and Privilege are Anathema to Any Society

         As stated, above, it is a simple and indisputable fact that a human being is in existence at fertilization.
    The unalienable and paramount right to life of each human being endowed by Our Creator is vested at
     fertilization. The government does not give us our right to life. No one owns the right to life of another
     human being in existence at fertilization.

ERROR OF FACT.
          It is an error of fact that any human being in existence at fertilization is a non-person to be treated

     as property. Our country has suffered through this error on at least three separate occasions: Slavery,
     Hitler's Final Solution, and Abortion. Each of these situations produced unrelenting conflict for our
     country because each was based on the error of fact in defining a whole class of human beings as non-
     persons. This error of fact created error of law, which, for a time, permitted innocent human beings to

Jul 23,93; NJGray, Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee  Judge Ginsburg.  .3 .
511

be denied dignity, freedom, protection and life.
     The apportionment clause of our Constitution defined slaves as three-fifths man and two-fifths

property, and a Federalist paper argued for this dual character of die slave in order to gain a compromise
and ratify the Constitution. However, the compromise did not bring peace, because people could not
tolerate a society in which each human being did not have full protection of the law. Slavery was such
provocation to the society that there was finally open conflict to eliminate the odious definition as "less
than human." Our Constitution was amended to provide due process and equal protection for all.

      Nazis defined a whole class of people as non-Aryan, and fashioned a Final Solution, by which Nazis
enslaved and killed human beings in die defined class. Allied forces not only fought to end the Final
Solution, but also held the Nuremberg Trials to establish a firm precedent that crimes against humanity
would not be tolerated by free people. We World War 0 veterans participated in an Allied effort to stop
forever the absolute evil of killing innocent human beings, which occurred "over there."

      It is incongruous to see that the absolute evil of deliberately killing even one innocent human being
could happen "over here" in our beloved America. It is even more incongruous to see mat any public
official would try to elevate this absolute evil as a "right" protected by our Constitution. In doing so, of
course, abortion is provoking unrest, because no people can tolerate the slaughter of the innocents.

ERROR OF LAW
            Our country must not suffer the innocent blood of even one prebom brother orsister. The government

      must protect the right t o life o f each human being in existence at fertilization. N o one and n o government
      may take away the right to life o f another human being in existence at fertilization. The Nuremberg Trials
      reaffirm that there is no justification for an individual to participate in crimes against humanity, which
      include abortion andgenocide. Abortion is not"Legal," as indicated by the following principles applied
      by the Nuremberg Tribunal, by which our government participated in hanging Nazis found guilty of
      crimes against humanity.

   It i s oft-heard that the Supreme Court "legalized" abortion by                   civilian population,... whether or not in violation of domestic law
its infamous decisions of January 22, 1973. What has really                          of the country where perpetrated.

ERROR IN SELEarr/LY APPLYING THE LAW
         The nominee has indicated a strong preference forassuring that individuals may make decisions about

     their own action without governmental interference, unless the action interferes with another human being.
     Our government does assert its right nowto protect society in many areas of civil rights - such as
     employment, education, welfare, housing - by interfering with individual decisions and actions. Our gov-
     ernment even asserts its rignts over the policies of civil rights of foreign sovereign nations, and may with-
     hold assistance onthe basis of a poor civil rights record. But. this nominee selectively would permit the
     deliberate murder of an innocent preborn child, and declare that the murderous acts by a pregnant mother,
     physician, counsellor, and other collaborators donot impinge onthe right to life of a prebom child, orthe
     rights of the father orof society.

          Hie Nuremberg Trials reaffirm that there is no justification for an individual to participate in crimes
     against humanity, which include abortion and genocide. The Trials reaffirm that those who participate
     in these crimes are individually responsible for the crimes, and have no tenable defense that they were
     merely a "good soldier" following orders or that thecrime was authorized by the government

          In order to embrace the error in fact and law that abortion is not murder, we must ask what other
     disqualifying leap into error of fact and law is possible for this nominee.

                                IV. COVER-UP OF ABORTION EVIL
                                        There is no Description of Whet is Abortion

          Just a short tune ago, the word "abortion" was so evil that it wasnot uttered in private or public
     Abortion not only murders a prebom child but also traumatizes and devastates a mother's mind and body.
     However, women libbers have managed to cover-up the evil of murder/abortion so effectively that the
     word "abortion" is used casually in these hearings before this Committee to determine the qualifications
     - orlack thereof - of a nominee to theSupreme Court. Here onpublic TV we hear the word "abortion"
     used as if it were a respectable act-- a "right," a "service," anda "necessity." But, no matter how women
     libbers tryto make abortion respectable, it is still just murder of the preboms anddestruction of mothers.

          Mr. Chairman, it is necessary, therefore, to ask some pertinent questions of Members of this
     Committee and of the nominee:

                    Cana woman bejust "a little bit pregnant?"
                     What really goes on behind the closed front doors of an abortion chamber?
                    Why do press andmedia not show the American public what abortion looks

                        like, just as they show us what slavery andtheFinal Solution look like'
                     Is there really informed consent for a pregnant mother and her prebom child

                        entering an abortion chamber?

No JUSTIFICATION FOR MURDERING PREBORN CHILDREN
          Yes, America, the intent of abortion is to kill a baby. But, in order to tryto justify murdering prebom

     children, abortionists use rhetoric to divert away from and cover up the torturing of pregnant mothers and
     killing of prebom children inside their abortion chambers. For instance:

           Diversionary Rhetoric. Abortionists do not truthfully and accurately describe their evil deeds
               inside their abortatoria. Rather, they use euphemisms, such as: pro-choice (to murder a son or
               daughter), termination of pregnancy (by murdering a son ordaughter), right ofprivacy (to murder
               a son or daughter), and who decides (tomurder a prebom sonor daughter) Abortionists must

     Jul 23,93; NJGray, Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee - Judge Ginsburg.
                               513

        tell the truth about what happens to a pregnant mother and her prebom child behind the
        abortionists' front doors.
     Define Away A Person. Abortionists want to define a prebom human being as not a "person."
        But, abortionists may not unilaterally decide who is and who isnot a "person," inorder selectively
        to kill an innocent human being in existence at fertilization.
     Most Abortions are Performed During the First Trimester. Murder by abortion is murder,
        whether the human subject is a few seconds old as a fertilized ovum or whether the prebom child
        is several weeks or months old andin the second or third trimester.
     Establish and Maintain a "Proper" Value of life. No one has a right to determine
        whether or not another human being has a "value" of life sufficient to protect theother human
        being from murder.
     Death Chambers Not Health Clinics. Abortionists refer to their killing centers as "medical
        facilities." This is an aberration. Nothing relating to "health" occurs in an abortatorium. A
        pregnant mother's body andmind areviolated and herprebom child is murdered. Hitler called
        his Death Chambers "Relocation Centers," as indeed wenow know they were.
     No "Need" to Murder - Equal Care. Abortionists refer to the "need" for abortion, or that
        abortion is "medically indicated." But, there is no malady for which the standard treatment is
        "murder a prebom child." In a pregnancy, there are two separate and distinct patients: a pregnant
        mother and her prebom child. The standard treatment istoprovide equal care forboth the mother
        and her child. Please see "Equal Care," page 3, above.
     Privacy or Equal Protection. Abortionists plead that abortion is protected by the right of
        privacy. Abortion is murder, and homicide is always a public matter for anysociety, as we see
        from the principles of the Nuremberg Trials. Murdering prebom children is done in public
        facilities, with public dollars, and cannever be tolerated asa matter or right of "privacy" or"equal
        protection" for anyone - pregnant mother, father, prebom child, or society.
     Poor Women. Abortionists plead for tax dollars from the public treasury to help "poor women."
        That is, they plead that if a rich woman canafford to murder her prebom child, thepublic must
        pay fora poor woman tomurder her prebom child. Neither rich nor poor pregnant mothers may
        murder their prebom children with impunity in America. And, our Land of the Free is great
        enough to provide true benefits to poor families rather than the wherewithal to murder their
        children. No society shall reduce the welfare rolls by murdering the young, and public dollars for
        abortion is really forced abortions for poor families who deserve respect and dignity.
     Teenagers. Abortionists plead fortax dollars to "help" teenagers. Abortionists provide murder-
        ing a prebom child as their response to the violation and destruction of statutory rape. Abortion-
        ists destroy the family byusing secret abortion to build a wedge between parents and their teen-
        agers. Abortion is thecause rather than the solution for any problem facing young people today.

N.B. These are the same old tired arguments which were repudiated for slavery and the Holocaust
The slave-owner said that the slave was his property with which he could do as he decided and
without governmental interference. Nazis acted as sovereigns who decided life or death. Now,
abortionists want to decide life or death, and inflict America with theshame of administering the
"death penalty" tomore than 4,000 innocent prebom human beings each day. And,abortion shall
be repudiated by America in favor of life.

               V. DISRESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE

    The protection of the right to life of each human being in existence at fertilization was purchased for

          514

us as a country and a generation by the blood of patriots shed since the declaration of our independent

Nation This same patriotic blood bought for us an end to slavery and threats by foreign nations to impose

a Final Solution on our freedoms and way of life.  i

It is untenable disrespect for our hard-won freedonii tnai &u. ^_ijr. . , a j penruu a e shading o

innocent blood of our prebom brothers and sisters by decriminalized murder/abortion. To condone, tolerate

or participate in this disrespect is disqualifying for anyone to serve in a position of public trust for ou'

country.

                                 VI. WHAT IS TO BE DONE!

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee,
     Why will the controversy about abortion not go away in our country, even though it is now two

decades since the Supreme Court handed down its infamous Roe v. Wade decision? There is no mystery
about this conflict -- it is heated because it involves life or death, and there is no in-between position for
compromise. The abortion issue must and shall be decided in favor of life for both the pregnant motner
and her innocent prebom child. The contentious issue of slavery lingered for decades because it had no
compromise, and our Nation decided it in favor of freedom. Certainly, Germany hai learned by :. past
inglorious history, and has decided not to commit more crimes against humanity by murder/abortion.

            N.B. At the dedication of the Holocaust Museum here in Washington
            a few weeks ago, survivors gave a strong message of (1) Never Again,
            and (2) Do Not Stand By. This message was not for just another time
            and another place, but for all time and for all places, including the
            United States to stop slaughter of the innocents now.

Mr. Chairman, and Members of this Senate Judiciary Committee,
     Our country suffers if the law of our land permits the deliberate killing of even one bom or prebom

human being in existence at fertilization. Our country suffers if even one elected or appointed public
official operates under the wrong impression that the law of our land permits the deliberate killing of even
one bom or prebom human being in existence at fertilization.

      It is your responsibility to assure that Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not confirmed to be a Justice
of our Supreme Court, because her own testimony indicates her disqualification based on pre-judging and
selectively permitting privileges.

                                                                            Iss Nellie J Gray

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for your testimony.
  Ms. Hirschmann.

                STATEMENT OF SUSAN HIRSCHMANN
  Ms. HIRSCHMANN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee,
thank you for the opportunity today to testify before you on this
important occasion.
  My name is Susan Hirschmann, and I am the executive director
of Eagle Forum, a national conservative, pro-family organization
headed by Phyllis Schlafly, of Alton, IL.
  We are concerned that Judge Ginsburg's record has not been
given the thorough examination that the writings of other recent
Supreme Court nominees have had. I have included a list of 20
questions that will be part of my testimony that we believe should
be answered before she is confirmed.
  Most of these questions are based on the book she coauthored in
1977, called "Sex Bias in the U.S. Code," which was published by
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, for which she was paid by the
Federal taxpayers under contract No. CR3AK010. The purpose of
the book was to identify how Federal laws must be changed to con-
form to the "equality principle" for which she is a leading advocate.
  So the questions that I think should be asked before she is con-
firmed will follow:
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the equality prin-
ciple means that women must be drafted into military service any-
time men are?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that there is a "need
for affirmative action" for women in the armed services?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the age of consent
for sexual acts should be lowered to 12 years?
  Do you still believe that the equality principle requires that stat-
utory rape laws be eliminated, because they only protect minor
girls?
  If you would approve of statutory rape laws, at what age would
you favor having them take effect?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the equality prin-
ciple requires that prostitution be legalized or decriminalized?
  Do you still believe, what you wrote in the 1974 Report of Colum-
bia Law School Equal Rights Advocacy Project on the Legal Status
of Women under Federal Law, that "replacing Mothers Day and
Fathers Day with Parents Day should be considered as an observ-
ance more consistent with a policy of minimizing traditional sex-
based differences in parental roles," as you wrote?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the equality prin-
ciple requires that prisons and reformatories be sex-integrated?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the Boy Scouts
and the Girl Scouts must change their names and become sex-inte-
grated, in order to conform to the equality principle and eliminate
the "stereotyped sex roles"?
  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the equality prin-
ciple requires that college fraternities and sororities be sex inte-
grated into "social societies"?
  Do you think that young adults on college campuses should not
be allowed to make their own choices of organizations, but that the
                                      516
government should dictate what gender-based organizations are
not allowed?

  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the concept of a
breadwinner husband and homemaker wife "must be eliminated
from the code, if it is to reflect the equality principle?

  Do you still believe, as you wrote in 1977, that the equality prin-
ciple "should impel development of a comprehensive program of
government-supported child care"?

  In your 1977 book, you wrote that "the Constitution * * * was
drafted using the generic term man." Will you show us in what
still-operative section of the U.S. Constitution the term "man" ap-
pears?

  Do you still disagree with the Supreme Court decisions ruling
that taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions, as you wrote in
1980 in the book "Constitutional Government in America"? Do you
believe that the equality principle requires taxpayers to pay for
abortions for women?

  Do you believe that the equality principle requires that there be
no legal restrictions on a woman's right to abortion?

  Is the New Republic magazine article correct in its August 2
issue, wherein it states that, during the 1970's, you artfully con-
cealed the effect the equal rights amendment would have on abor-
tion rights, in order to assist ratification of ERA, but after it was
dead, you then made public your theory that the principle of gen-
der equality requires legal access to abortion?

  Do you believe in affirmative action for women in the workplace?
  Finally, exactly what changes in the law do you favor, in order
to attain the equality principle for which you are known as the
leading advocate?
  We think that, if these questions are answered, the myth of
Judge Ginsburg as a "moderate" will be debunked. In fact, her
writings betray her as a radical feminist, far out of the main-
stream.
  I would ask that these oral remarks, as well as additional writ-
ten remarks be included as pdrt of my testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be.
  Ms. HiRSCHMANN. I would like to express my appreciation for you
allowing another side to be presented today. Thank you very much
for the opportunity to testify.
  [The prepared statement of Ms. Hirschmann follows:]

       TESTIMONY RE: RUTH BADER GINSBURG

                      by: Susan Hirschmann, Executive Director
                                                 Eagle Forum

                             To the Senate Judiciary Committee
                                               July 23, 1993

          Ruth Bader Ginsburg's writings show her to be a radical,
 doctrinaire feminist, far out of the mainstream. She shares the
 chip-on-the-shoulder, radical feminist view that American women
 have endured centuries of oppression and mistreatment from men.
 That's why, in her legal writings, she self-identifies with
 feminist Sarah Grimke's statement, "All I ask of our brethren is
 that they take their feet off our necks," and with feminist
 Simone de Beauvoir's put-down of women as "the second sex." (De
 Beauvoir's most famous guote is, "Marriage is an obscene
 bourgeois institution.")

         A typical feminist. Ruth Bader Ginsbura wants affirmative
action quota hiring for career women but at the same time wants
to wipe out the special rights that state laws traditionally gave
to wives. In a speech published by the Phi Beta Kappa Kev
Reporter in 1974, Ginsburg called for affirmative action hiring
quotas for career women, using the police as an example in point.
She said, "Affirmative action is called for in this situation."

        On the other hand, she considered it a setback for "women's
rights" when the Supreme Court, in Kahn v. Shevin (1974), upheld
a Florida property tax exemption for widows. Ginsburg disdains
what she calls "traditional sex roles" and demands strict gender
neutrality (except, of course, for quota hiring of career women).

        Ginsburg's real claim to her status as the premier feminist
 lawyer is her success in winning the 1973 Supreme Court case
Frontiero v. Richardson, which she unabashedly praised as an
"activist" decision. She obviously shares the view of Justice
William Brennan's opinion that American men, "in practical
effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage," and that
"throughout much of the 19th century the position of women in our
                                     518

 society was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under
 the pre-Civil War slave codes."

          Anyone who thinks that American women in the 19th century
 were treated like slaves, and in the 20th century were kept in a
 "cage," has a world view that is downright dangerous to have on
 the U.S. Supreme Court. She's another Brennan, and no
 conservative should vote to confirm her.

         Of course, Ginsburg passed President Clinton's self-
 proclaimed litmus test for appointment to the Supreme Court -- she
 is "pro-choice." But that's not all; she wants to write taxpayer
 funding of abortions into the U.S. Constitution, something that
 72% of Americans oppose and even the pro-abortion, pro-Roe v.
Wade Supreme Court refused to do.

         It has been considered settled law since the Supreme Court
decisions in a trilogy of cases in 1977 fBeal v. Doe. Maher v.
Roe, and Poelker v. Doe) that the Constitution does not compel
states to pay for abortions. These cases were followed by the
1980 Supreme Court decision of Harris v. McRae upholding the Hyde
Amendment's ban on spending federal taxpayers' money for
abortions. The Court ruled that "it simply does not follow that
a woman's freedom of choice [to have an abortion] carries with it
a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail
herself of the full range of protected choices."

         Ginsburg has planted herself firmly in opposition to this
settled law. In a 1980 book entitled Constitutional Government
in America. Judge Ginsburg wrote a chapter endorsing taxpayer
funding of abortions as a constitutional right and condemning the
high Court's rulings.

         "This was the year the women lost," Ginsburg wrote in her
analysis of the 1977 cases. "Most unsettling of the losses are
the decisions on access by the poor to elective abortions."
Criticizing the 6-to-3 majority in the funding cases, Ginsburg
asserted that "restrictions on public funding and access to
                                     519

 public hospitals for poor women" were a retreat from Roe v. Wade,
 as well as a "stunning curtailment" of women's rights.

         The phony "concern" expressed by pro-abortion lobbyists like
Kate Michelman is just a smokescreen. Ginsburg's article
 criticizing Roe v. Wade, which has received some attention since
her nomination, merely complained that the Court didn't adopt the
 "women's equality" theory that she had personally developed in
the 1970s. Ginsburg's article was not a legal criticism, but a
political one: if the Court had been less categorical in its Roe
language, she said, it would not have provoked the "well-
organized and vocal right-to-life movement." Ginsburg preferred
to legalize abortion with arcane and obtuse legal gobbledegook
that didn't agitate the grassroots.

 Feminists Want to Change Our Laws
         Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a longtime advocate of the extremist

 feminist notion that any differentiation whatsoever on account of
 gender should be unconstitutional. Her radical views are made
clear in a book called Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, which she co-
authored in 1977 with another feminist, Brenda Feigen-Fasteau,
 for which they were paid with federal funds under Contract No.
CR3AK010.

         Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, published by the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights, was the source of the claim widely made in the
1970s that 800 federal laws "discriminated" on account of sex.
The 230-page book was written to identify those laws and to
recommend the specific changes demanded by the feminist movement
in order to conform to the "equality principle" and promote
ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, for which Ginsburg
was a fervent advocate. (The ERA died in 1982.)

        Sex Bias in the U.S. Code is a handbook which shows how the
feminists want to change our laws, our institutions and our
attitudes, and convert America into a "gender-free" society. It
clearly shows that the feminists are not trying to redress any
                                     520

   legitimate grievances women might have, but want to change human
  nature, social mores, and relationships between men and women --
  and want to do that by changing our laws. Despite the noisy
  complaints of the feminists about the oppression of women, a
  combing of federal laws by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, then a Columbia
  University Law School professor, and her staff under a federal
  grant of tax dollars, unearthed no federal laws that harm women!
  The feminists' complaints about "discriminatory laws" are either
  ridiculous or offensive.

          Here are some of the extremist feminist concepts from the
 Ginsburg book, Sex Bias in the U.S. Code:

                                        . . . in the Military
 1. Women must be drafted when men are drafted.

          "Supporters of the equal rights principle firmly reject
 draft or combat exemption for women, as Congress did when it
 refused to qualify the Equal Rights Amendment by incorporating
 any military service exemption. The equal rights principle
 implies that women must be subject to the draft if men are, that
military assignments must be made on the basis of individual
capacity rather than sex." (p. 218)

         "Equal rights and responsibilities for men and women implies
that women must be subject to draft registration . . . " (p. 202)
2. Women must be assigned to military combat duty.

         "Until the combat exclusion for women is eliminated, women
who choose to pursue a career in the military will continue to be
held back by restrictions unrelated to their individual
abilities. Implementation of the equal rights principle requires
a unitary system of appointment, assignment, promotion,
discharge, and retirement, a system that cannot be founded on a
combat exclusion for women." (p. 26)
3. Affirmative action must be applied for women in the armed

        services.
        "The need for affirmative action and for transition measures
is particularly strong in the uniformed services." (p. 218)

                                     . . . in Moral Standards

  1. The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12
          years old.
          "Eliminate the phrase 'carnal knowledge of any female, not

 his wife, who has not attained the age of 16 years' and
 substitute a federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense. . .

      A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act
 with another person, . . . [and] the other person is, in fact,
 less than 12 years old." (p. 102)
 2. Bigamists must have special privileges that other felons

         don't have.
          "This section restricts certain rights, including the right
 to vote or hold office, of bigamists, persons *cohabiting with
more than one woman,' and women cohabiting with a bigamist.
Apart from the male/female differentials, the provision is of
questionable constitutionality since it appears to encroach
impermissibly upon private relationships." (pp. 195-196)
3. Prostitution must be legalized: it is not sufficient to
         change the law to sex-neutral language.
         "Prostitution proscriptions are subject to several
constitutional and policy objections. Prostitution, as a
consensual act between adults, is arguably within the zone of
privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions." (p. 97)
        "Retaining prostitution business as a crime in a criminal
code is open to debate. Reliable studies indicate that
prostitution is not a major factor in the spread of venereal
disease, and that prostitution plays a small and declining role
in organized crime operations." (p. 99)
         "Current provisions dealing with statutory rape, rape, and
prostitution are discriminatory on their face. . . . There is a
growing national movement recommending unqualified
decriminalization [of prostitution] as sound policy, implementing
equal rights and individual privacy principles." (pp. 215-216)
                                      522

   4. The Mann Act must be repealed; women should not be protected
           from "bad" men.
           "The Mann Act . . . prohibits the transportation of women

  and girls for prostitution, debauchery, or any other immoral
  purpose. The act poses the invasion of privacy issue in an acute
  form. The Mann Act also is offensive because of the image of
  women it perpetuates. . . . It was meant to protect from xthe
  villainous interstate and international traffic in women and
  girls,' *those women and girls who, if given a fair chance,
  would, in all human probability, have been good wives and mothers
  and useful citizens. . . . The act was meant to protect weak
-women from bad men." (pp. 98-99)
  5. Prisons and reformatories must be sex-integrated.

          "If the grand design of such institutions is to prepare
 inmates for return to the community as persons equipped to
 benefit from and contribute to civil society, then perpetuation
 of single-sex institutions should be rejected. . . . 18 U.S.C.
 4082, ordering the Attorney General to commit convicted
 offenders to *available suitable, and appropriate' institutions,
 is not sex discriminatory on its face. It should not be applied
 . . . to permit consideration of a person's gender as a factor
 making a particular institution appropriate or suitable for that
person." (p. 101)
 6. In the merchant marine, provisions for passenger

         accommodations must be sex-neutralized, and women may not
         have more bathrooms than men.
         "46 U.S.C. 152 establishes different regulations for male
and female occupancy of double berths, confines male passengers
without wives to the * forepart' of the vessel, and segregates
unmarried females in a separate and closed compartment. 46
U.S.C. 153 requires provision of a bathroom for every 100 male
passengers for their exclusive use and one for every 50 female
passengers for the exclusive use of females and young children."
(P- 190)
                                     523

           "46 U.S.C. 152 might be changed to allow double occupancy
  by two ^consenting adults.' . . . Requirements for separate
  bathroom facilities stipulated in Section 153 should be retained
  but equalized so that the ratio of persons to facility is not
  sex-determined." (p. 192)

                                           . . . in Education
  1. Sinale-sex schools and colleges, and sinale-sex school and

          college activities must be sex-integrated.
          "The equal rights principle looks toward a world in which
 men and women function as full and equal partners, with
 artificial barriers removed and opportunity unaffected by a
 person's gender. Preparation for such a world requires
 elimination of sex separation in all public institutions where
 education and training occur." (p. 101)
 2. All-boys' and all-girls' organizations must be sex-
          integrated because separate-but-equal organizations
          perpetuate stereotyped sex roles.
          "Societies established by Congress to aid and educate young
 people on their way to adulthood should be geared toward a world
 in which equal opportunity for men and women is a fundamental
 principle. The educational purpose would be served best by
 immediately extending membership to both sexes in a single
organization." (pp. 219-220)
3. Fraternities and sororities must be sex-integrated.
         "Replace college fraternity and sorority chapters with
college
  'social societies.'" (p. 169)
4. The Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, and other Congressionallv-
         chartered youth organizations, must change their names and
         their purposes and become sex-integrated.
         "Six organizations, which restrict membership to one sex,
furnish educational, financial, social and other assistance to
their young members. These include the Boy Scouts, the Girl
                                   524

  Scouts, Future Farmers of America . . . , Boys' Clubs of America
  . . ., Big Brothers of America . . . , and the Naval Sea Cadets
  Corps. . . . The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, while ostensibly
  providing *separate but equal' benefits to both sexes, perpetuate
  stereotyped sex roles to the extent that they carry out
  congressionally-mandated purposes. 36 U.S.C. 23 defines the
  purpose of the Boy Scouts as the promotion of '. . . the ability
  of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in
  scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance,
  and kindred virtues. . . .' The purpose of the Girl Scouts, on
 the other hand, is x. . . t o promote the qualities of truth,
  loyalty, helpfulness, friendliness, courtesy, purity, kindness,
 obedience, cheerfulness, thriftiness, and kindred virtues among
 girls, as a preparation for their responsibilities in the home
 and for service to the community. . . ' (36 U.S.C. 33.)" (pp.
 145-146)

          "Organizations that bestow material benefits on their
 members should consider a name change to reflect extension of
 membership to both sexes . . . [and] should be revised to conform
 to these changes. Review of the purposes and activities of all
 these clubs should be undertaken to determine whether they
 perpetuate sex-role stereotypes." (pp. 147-148)

 5. The 4-H Bovs and Girls Clubs must be sex-integrated into 4-H
         Youth Clubs.
         "Change in the proper name M - H Boys and Girls Clubs' should

reflect consolidation of the clubs to eliminate sex segregation,
e.g., M-H-Youth Clubs.'" (p. 138)

6- Men and women should be required to salute the flag in the
         same wav.
         "Differences [between men and women] in the authorized

method of saluting the flag should be eliminated in 36 U.S.C.
177." (p. 148)
                                    525

                                         . . . in the Family
 1. The traditional family concept of husband as breadwinner and

         wife as homemaker must be eliminated.
         "Congress and the President should direct their attention to
the concept that pervades the Code: that the adult world is (and
 should be) divided into two classes -- independent men, whose
primary responsibility is to win bread for a family, and
dependent women, whose primary responsibility is to care for
children and household. This concept must be eliminated from the
code if it is to reflect the equality principle." (p. 206)
         "It is a prime recommendation of this report that all
legislation based on the breadwinning, husband-dependent,
homemaking-wife pattern be recast using precise functional
description in lieu of gross gender classification." (p. 212)
         "A scheme built upon the breadwinning husband [and]
dependent homemaking wife concept inevitably treats the woman's
efforts or aspirations in the economic sector as less important
than the man's." (p. 209)

2. The Federal Government must provide comprehensive government
         child-care.
         "The increasingly common two-earner family pattern should

impel development of a comprehensive program of government-
supported child care." (p. 214)

3. The right to determine the family residence must be taken
        awav from the husband.
        "Title 43 provisions on homestead rights of married couples

 are premised on the assumption that a husband is authorized to
 determine the family's residence. This xhusbana s prerogative'
 is obsolete." (p. 214)
 4. Homestead law must give twice as much benefit to couples who

         live apart from each other as to a husband and wife who live
         together.
         "Married couples who choose to live together would be able
                                 526

 to enter upon only one tract at a time." (p. 175) "Couples
willing to live apart could make entry on two tracts." (p. 176)
5. No-fault divorce must be adopted nationally.

         "Consideration should be given to revision of 38 U.S.C.
101(3) to reflect the trend toward no-fault divorce." (p. 159)
"Retention of a fault concept in provisions referring to
separation . . . is questionable in light of the trend away from
fault determinations in the dissolution of marriages." (pp. 214-
215)

. . . in Language

1. About 750 of the 800 federal laws that allegedly

"discriminate" on account of sex merely involve the use of so-

called "sexist" words which the ERAers wanted to censor out of

the English language. "The following is a list of specific

recommended word changes" which the feminists want censored out

of Federal laws (pp. 15-16, 52-53).

               businessman      nautical or seafaring duties
duties of seamanship

        Sex Bias even demands bad grammar to appease the feminists:
"All federal statutes, regulations, and rules shall [use] plural
constructions to avoid third person singular pronouns." (pp. 52-
53)
                                     527

          2. In another piece of silliness, Sex Bias demands that
 Congress create a female anti-litter symbol to match "Johnny
 Horizon."

          "A further unwarranted male reference . . . regulates use of
 the ^Johnny Horizon' anti-litter symbol. . .  This sex
 stereotype of the outdoorsperson and protector of the environment
 should be supplemented with a female figure promoting the same
 values. The two figures should be depicted as persons of equal
 strength of character, displaying equal familiarity and concern
 with the terrain of our country." (p. 100)

          3. On the other hand, Sex Bias shows its hypocrisy by
 demanding that the "Women's Bureau" in the U.S. Department of
 Labor be continued. Although the authors admit that this is
 "inappropriate" (it is obviously sex discriminatory), they simply
 demand it anyway. "The Women's Bureau is . . . a necessary and
 proper office for service during a transition period until the
 equal rights principle is realized." (p. 221)

         4. Sex Bias in the U.S. Code makes a fundamental error in
 stating: "The Constitution, which provides the framework for the
American legal system, was drafted using the generic term 'man'."
 (p. 2) The word "man" does not appear in the U.S. Constitution
 (except in a no-longer-operative section of the 14th Amendment,
which is not in effect now and was not in effect when the
Constitution was "drafted"). The U.S. Constitution is a
beautiful sex-neutral document. It exclusively uses sex-neutral
words such as person, citizen, resident, inhabitant, President,
Vice President, Senator, Representative, elector, Ambassador, and
minister, so that women enjoy every constitutional right that men
enjoy -- and always have.

        Sex Bias in the U.S. Code proves that Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
"equality principle" would bring about extremist changes in our
legal, political, social, and educational structures. The
feminists are working hard -- with our tax dollars -- to bring this
                                    528

about by constitutional mandate (through the Equal Rights
Amendment) OJC by legislative changes  by judicial activism.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been their premier lawyer for two
decades.

         Finally, who but an embittered feminist could have said what
Ruth Bader Ginsburg said when she stood beside President Clinton
in the Rose Garden the day of her nomination for the Supreme
Court: She wished that her mother had "lived in an age when
daughters are. cherished as much as sons." Where in the world has
Ginsburg been living? In China? In India? Her statement was an
insult to all American parents who do, indeed, cherish their
daughters as much as their sons.
                                      529

  The CHAIRMAN. We are happy to have your testimony. I might
add that I know that some of you did not know whether you want-
ed to testify until late in the process, and I particularly appreciate
you coming across the country from California and from Illinois,
and I hope, as this has gone, we have tried to accommodate those
who asked to testify, even when it has been a little down the line.
Mr. Phillips asked early on.

  It is nice to see you again, Kay Coles James. The last time we
saw you before this committee, you were a nominee. It is nice to
see you again.

                  STATEMENT OF KAY COLES JAMES
  Ms. JAMES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I must admit that I prefer
this seat in terms of the one I had before.
  The CHAIRMAN. Being a witness, rather than a nominee.
  Ms. JAMES. Exactly right.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also like to thank the rest of
the committee for this opportunity to contribute to the deliberative
process on Judge Ginsburg.
  Judge Ginsburg has presented herself as a moderate and as an
advocate of judicial moderation. Yet, many of her remarks reveal
a philosophy of judicial activism, most notably with regard to abor-
tion, where she clearly revealed views that I believe are radical and
activist, and I will even argue wrong.
  Judge Ginsburg rightly claimed the privilege of refusing to an-
swer questions that might commit her on issues likely to come be-
fore the Court, and she exercised this privilege on a wide range of
issues, refusing, for instance, either to endorse or reject the view
that sexual orientation is a suspect classification for equal protec-
tion purposes, or the view that the capital punishment violates the
eighth amendment, even though it is specifically contemplated by
the fifth.
  But on abortion, Judge Ginsburg not only declined to exercise the
privilege, she reached out, in answering a question from Senator
Brown that could have been answered much less broadly, and de-
livered a ringing statement of her pro-abortion position.
  Specifically, she said that the abortion right is, in her words, es-
sential to women's equality and dignity. She said, furthermore,
that when government controls that decision for a woman, she is
being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her
own choices.
  Let me point out first that there is not a shred of law in that
statement. Right or wrong, it is pure policy. This is a very strange
comment coming from someone who postures as a believer in judi-
cial moderation.
  Though, Senator I don't think that she ever really answered your
question on how she can reconcile her advocacy of a broad policy
driven construction of the equal protection clause with her more re-
cent advocacy of a restrained judiciary, the answer is not hard to
find in her speeches and, in fact, in her articles.
  She believes the Supreme Court can and should promote radical
change, but it should be done slowly, and the slowness is based not
on principle, but on expediency. If the Court moves too fast, the
electorate reacts in the opposite direction, and this is precisely her
                                                   530

so-called criticism of Roe v. Wade. She understands that the elec-
torate in the hands of a liberal, yet cautious judiciary is like a frog
in a pot of slowly-heating water. It will never notice the increasing
temperature and will get boiled to death, rather than jump out.

  But I will leave equal protections of history to one side, because
I am not an attorney. What I am is an African-American woman
who has put a certain amount of effort into reminding our increas-
ingly self-obsessed society about the right of the most vulnerable
category of human beings, the only ones who have been held as a
matter of constitutional law to be completely without rights, the
human unborn.

  Judge Ginsburg believes that laws that command people to re-
spect the rights of the human unborn treat the mother as "less
than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices." Mr.
Chairman, a similar critique could be leveled at any law whatso-
ever. All laws direct human conduct in some fashion, and, to that
extent, all laws deprive people of absolute autonomy.

  Senator Simon is concerned that any Supreme Court nominee he
votes for be someone who will increase freedom. But I don't think
he means he wants someone who will, say, rule that the 1960 Civil
Rights Act is unconstitutional. That act unquestionably limited
what some people regard as freedoms, the freedom to decide whom
to associate with on the job, the freedom to control the use of one's
own property, and so forth. Many employers and restaurant owners
argued, in fact, that the act treats them as "less than fully adult
humans responsible for their own choices." But it passed, as well
it should have, and it continues to command overwhelming support
in the electorate, because the limitations it imposed on freedom
were necessary to protect the rights of other people whose rights
and dignity were being denied, just as the rights and dignity of
children in the womb are being denied today.

  Judge Ginsburg frames the abortion right with no trace of having
confronted the question of whether there might be a party other
than the mother with a life-or-death stake in the abortion decision.

  One of her formulations of the abortion right is that "women
have a right free from unwarranted governmental intrusion wheth-
er or not to bear children." That is something I myself could say
amen to, were it not for the question of those conceived but not yet
born. But asserting a right not to bear a child, regardless of wheth-
er or not that child has already come into existence, is like assert-
ing a right to fire a loaded gun, regardless of whether or not there
is someone standing in the path of the bullet.

  Finally, I would like to say a few words about this notion that
the right to take the life of the innocent preborn child as necessary
to women's equality and freedom in society. This view, in my belief,
is a total capitulation to the old saw about how it is a man's world.
Those who adhere to it are, in effect, saying that in order to
achieve dignity and standing in the world, women have to have the
equivalent of male bodies, but they don't. Women don't need to mu-
tilate their bodies or take the lives of their children in order to be
equal to any man. The real feminists are those who say I'm preg-
nant, I can bear children, and you had better be prepared to deal
with it. [Applause.]
                                      531

  The Senate is about to put an advocate of the male assimilation
theory of women's rights onto the Supreme Court and to earn plau-
dits from the feminist establishment for doing so, not to mention
plaudits from the media for confirming a moderate.

  So it probably won't matter that, for this nominee, moderation is
a political tactic, rather than a legal practice. Nor will it matter
that the nominee's reasoning on abortion is premised on the notion,
to paraphrase the Dred Scott decision, that the unborn have no
rights that the born are bound to respect. But I think it is a trag-
edy that we have sunk to the point that this is our idea of a non-
controversial nominee.

  Mr. Chairman, I do thank you and the committee for the oppor-
tunity to come here and say so today.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for a reasoned, dispassionate, well-
stated statement. As I said, it is nice to have you back before the
committee and it is nice to know that you would rather be a wit-
ness than a nominee. I guess it is a different role.

  Welcome back, Mr. Phillips. One thing for certain, you are non-
partisan in your criticism. The last time you were here, if I remem-
ber--I mean this to establish your bona fides here--you were not
reluctant to oppose a Republican nominee, and you are not reluc-
tant to oppose a Democratic nominee.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. I am nonpartisan. I am bipartisan.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is a better way of saying it. The floor is
yours.

                 STATEMENT OF HOWARD PHILLIPS
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you very much, sir, Senator Hatch, Senator
Specter.
  When we are told that a unanimous vote is in the offing, the
American people have the right to ask, in all seriousness, do all
Senators share the same standard of judgment. In 1990, when you
accorded me the opportunity to testify in opposition to the nomina-
tion of David Souter, I asserted that the overarching moral issue
in the political life of the United States in the last third of the 20th
century is the question of abortion: Is the unborn child a human
person entitled to the protections pledged to each of us by the
Founders of the Nation?
  The first duty of the law and the civil government established to
enforce that law is to prevent the shedding of innocent blood. As
Notre Dame law professor Charles Rice has pointed out, this is so,
because the common law does not permit a person to kill an inno-
cent nonaggressor, even to save his own life.
  I have no reason to believe that Mrs. Ginsburg has personally
caused human lives to be extinguished, as was clearly the case
with David Souter, when President Bush put his name forward.
Nor do I in any other way challenge Mrs. Ginsburg's nomination
on grounds of personal character. I do, however, urge that Mrs.
Ginsburg's nomination be rejected on grounds that the standard of
judgment she would bring on the overriding issue of whether the
Constitution protects our God-given right to life is a wrong stand-
ard.
  Instead of defending the humanity and divinely imparted right
to life of preborn children, she would simply be another vote for the
                                             532

proposition that our unborn children are less than human, and that
their lives may be snuffed out, without due process of law and with
impunity. As a matter of practice and belief, Mrs. Ginsburg has
failed to acknowledge or recognize that the first duty of the law is
indeed the defense of innocent human life.

  If it is Mrs. Ginsburg*s position, and it does seem to be her view,
that the extinguishment of innocent unborn human lives without
due process of law is not only constitutionally permissible, but that
those who engage in the practice of destroying unborn lives should
enjoy constitutional protection for doing so, she may have a per-
spective consistent with that held by members of this committee.
But it is not one which is consistent with either the plain language
of the Constitution or with the revulsion toward abortion which
prevailed at the time when our Constitution was drafted and rati-
fied.

  While Ms. Ginsburg has disagreed with the reasoning in Roe. v.
Wade, she has at no time expressed dissatisfaction with the mil-
lions of legal abortions which were facilitated by that decision, even
though she would have argued that discrimination rather than pri-
vacy was the core issue. By Ms. Ginsburg's logic, it is unconstitu-
tional discrimination to deny females the opportunity to extinguish
any lives which may result from their sexual conduct. Her argu-
ment would seem to be with our creator inasmuch as he did not
equally assign the same childbearing function to males. Consistent
with her warped perspective, Ms. Ginsburg as a litigator argued
that pregnancy should be treated as a disability rather than as a
gift from God.

  The question of personhood and of the humanity of the preborn
child is at the very heart of the abortion issue in law, in morals,
and in fact. Justice John Paul Stevens expressed his opinion in the
1986 Thornburgh case that there is a fundamental and well-recog-
nized difference between a fetus and a human being. He admitted
that indeed if there is not such a difference, the permissibility of
terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of
the State legislatures.

  In the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court indicated that
if the unborn child is a person, the State could not allow abortion
even to save the life of the mother. In fact, the majority opinion de-
ciding Roe v. Wade--inthat opinion, the Supreme Court said that
if the personhood of the unborn child is established, the pro-abor-
tion case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then
be guaranteed specifically by the 14th amendment.

  Although my reasoning is different, I agree with Justice Stevens
when he argues that if the unborn child is recognized as a human
person, there is no constitutional basis to justify Federal protection
of abortion anywhere in the United States of America. Indeed, on
the contrary, if the preborn child is, in fact, a human person cre-
ated in God's image, premeditated abortion is unconstitutional in
every one of the 50 States.

  Ms. Ginsburg should be closely questioned by members of the Ju-
diciary Committee concerning whether she believes the unborn
child is a human person created in God's image. This is the core
issue. If this is not her understanding--and it does not seem to
                                                533

be--she should be asked to indicate by what logic she reaches a
contrary conclusion.

  It has been reported concerning Ms. Ginsburg that several of her
writings provide a glimpse into her approach to the Constitution.
In an article in Law and Inequality, a journal of theory and prac-
tice, she wrote that, "a too strict jurisprudence of the Framers'
original intent seems to me unworkable." She went on to write that
adherence to our 18th century Constitution is dependent on change
in society's practices, constitutional amendment, and judicial inter-
pretation.

  Furthermore, in the Washington University Law Quarterly she
remarked that boldly dynamic interpretation, departing radically
from the original understanding of the Constitution, is sometimes
necessary. And in a speech this March at New York University,
Judge Ginsburg advocated using the Supreme Court to enact social
change. Without taking giant strides, the Court, through constitu-
tional adjudication, she said, can reinforce or signal a green light
for social change.

  It is not surprising that different people might reach different
conclusions about the intent of the Framers, but it is quite another
thing for a prospective Justice of the Supreme Court to presume to
substitute his or her own opinion for the plain meaning of the origi-
nal document, as lawfully amended.

  I hope the members of this committee will probe more deeply
into Ms. Ginsburg's present view of the opinions she expressed in
these briefs, articles, and speeches. If she is unwilling to repudiate
them credibly and entirely, then even aside from her apparent fail-
ure to recognize the duty of the State to safeguard innocent hu-
manity, she would seem to have disqualified herself from a position
in which she is expected to be a guardian of the Constitution. Oth-
erwise, a vote to confirm Ms. Ginsburg becomes a vote to empower
a permanent one-woman constitutional convention which never
goes out of session.

  Indeed, in view of the position taken by Ms. Ginsburg that it is
the duty of Supreme Court Justices to disregard the plain words
and intentions of the Constitution, it is particularly important that
her personal opinions be even more closely scrutinized.

  It is the particular obligation of those who might disagree with
Ms. Ginsburg's ideology and policy objectives to either oppose her
nomination on the basis of such disagreement or to henceforth
cease their personal professions of conviction on those particular is-
sues, whether they relate to abortion, to homosexuality, or to some
other issue where Ms. Ginsburg's philosophical predilections are a
matter of public record.

  I see that my time is up, so I will terminate my testimony there,
asking that the balance of it be submitted to the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be placed in the record.

                                         SUMMARY OF TESTIMONY

                IN OPPOSITION TO CONFIRMATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG

                        To BE A JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

                          Excerpts from Testimony of Howard Phillips

         When we are told that a unanimous vote is in the offing, the
American people have the right to ask in all seriousness: "Do all
Senators share the same standard of judgment?"

         By Mrs. Ginsburg's logic, it is unconstitutional discrimination
to deny females the opportunity to extinguish any lives which may
result from their sexual conduct. Her argument would seem to be with
our Creator, inasmuch as he did not equally assign the same childbear-
ing function to males. Consistent with her warped perspective, Mrs.
Ginsburg, as a litigator, argued that pregnancy should be treated as a
disability rather than as a gift from God.

         Indeed, in a 1972 brief, Mrs. Ginsburg argued that "exaltation of
woman's unique role in bearing children has, in effect, restrained
women from developing their individual talents...and has impelled them
to accept a dependent, subordinate status in society."

         Moreover in 1984, in a soeech at the University of North Caroli-
na, Mrs. Ginsburg went so far as to maintain that the government has a
legal "duty" to use taxpayer funds to subsidize abortion.

         In an article in Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and
Practice, she wrote that 'a too strict jurisprudence of the framers'
original intent seems to me unworkable.' She went on to write that
adherence to 'our eighteenth century Constitution' is dependent on
'change in society's practices, constitutional amendment, and judicial
interpretation.' Furthermore, in the Washington University Law
Quarterly, she remarked that 'boldly dynamic interpretation departing
radically from the original understanding' of the Constitution is
sometimes necessary."

         It is not surprising that different people might reach different
conclusions about the intent of the Framers. But it is quite another
thing for a prospective Justice of the Supreme Court to presume to
substitute his or her own opinion for the plain meaning of the origi-
nal document as lawfully amended. If she is unwilling to repudiate it
credibly and entirely, then, even aside from her apparent failure to
recognize the duty of the state to safeguard innocent humanity, she
would seem to have disqualified herself from a position in which she
is expected to be a guardian of the Constitution. Otherwise, a vote
to confirm Mrs. Ginsburg becomes a vote to empower a permanent one
woman Constitutional convention which never goes out of session.

         Mrs. Ginsburg's views on virtually every subject which might
conceivably be addressed by the Supreme Court are relevant to the
consideration of this body.

         It is the particular obligation of those who might disagree with
Mrs. Ginsburg's ideology and policy objectives to either oppose her
nomination on the basis of such disagreement, or to henceforth cease
their personal professions of conviction on those particular issues
whether they relate to abortion, to homosexuality, or to some other
issue where Mrs. Ginsburg's philosophical predilections are a matter
of public record.

         Mrs. Ginsburg's nomination should be rejected.

                                 536

         Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, my name is Howard Phil-
lips. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to testify on behalf
of The Conservative Caucus with respect to the nomination of Ruth
Bader Ginsburg to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.

         On Monday evening, June 14, I saw Senators Orrin Hatch and
Patrick Leahy on CNN talking with Larry King about the nomination of
Mrs. Ginsburg, whose appointment had been announced earlier that day.
Both Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy were effusive in their praise of
Mrs. Ginsburg, and Senator Hatch opined that Mrs. Ginsburg would, in
all likelihood, be confirmed by a Senate vote of 100 to nothing.

         It is particularly interesting to note that Mrs. Ginsburg's
nomination seems also to be warmly appreciated by Ross Perot who,
according to published reports, has for many years benefited from the
professional counsel of Mrs. Ginsburg's husband, Professor Martin
Ginsburg. Mr. Perot reportedly thought so highly of Professor
Ginsburg that in 1986 he contributed $1 million in his honor to
Georgetown University.

         And as Mr. Perot would put it, "isn't it interesting" that Mrs.
Ginsburg's nomination occurred only a number of days after Mr. Perot
and David Gergen had communed on the island of Bermuda, immediately
prior to Mr. Gergen formally joining President Clinton's White House
staff?

         It is indeed a small world.
         Whenever all one hundred Senators, Republican and Democrat alike,
agree on something, it's time for ordinary citizens to wonder why.
And when Ross Perot is also part of the "amen chorus", it's time to
ask "who owns the franchise on happiness pills?".

         Are there no issues at controversy which might stir s_ e serious
debate? Are there no conflicts in philosophy among the menbers of the
Senate, which is so often characterized "as the world's greatest
deliberative body"?

         Or is it possible that for various reasons, perhaps even
including gender or ethnicity, some nominees are beyond substantive
criticism. In such instances, it may even be "politically incorrect"
to question the worthiness of a nominee who might otherwise be
controversial.
                                  537

         When we are told that a unanimous vote is in the offing, the
American people have the right to ask in all seriousness: "Do all
Senators share the same standard of judgment?"

         Or does it seem politically awkward for some to openly express
their privately held concerns by voting against confirmation of a
nominee who has benefited from uncritical media coverage.

         Presuming that standards of judgment do vary, is it not
surprising that a virtually unanimous coincidence of conclusion seems
to have emerged with respect to this nomination as it has on certain
prior occasions but not when Judge Bork and Judge Thomas were under
consideration?

         Is it not possible that some views are not being adequately
represented in what should be a great debate on this important
lifetime appointment?

         On September 19, 1990, when you accorded me the opportunity to
testify in opposition to the nomination of David Souter to be a
Justice of the Supreme Court, I asserted that "The overarching moral
issue in the political life of the United states in the last third of
the 20th Century is, in my opinion, the question of abortion. Is the
unborn child a human person, entitled to the protections pledged to
each of us by the Founders of our Nation?"

         The first duty of the law and of the civil government estab-
lished to enforce that law is to prevent the shedding of innocent
blood. As Notre Dame law professor Charles Rice has pointed out,
"This is so, because the common law does not permit a person to kill
an innocent non-aggressor, even to save his own life."

         My objections to Justice Souter were premised not only on his
legal philosophy, but on his personal history of having facilitated
the liberalization of abortion policies at two hospitals for which he
was an overseer.

         I presented facts which established without rebuttal that Mr.
Souter's posture of neutrality on this great question of life and
death was contradicted by his personal complicity in the performance
of many hundreds of abortions at Concord Memorial Hospital and
Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital in New Hampshire.

         I have no reason to believe that Mrs. Ginsburg has personally
caused human lives to be extinguished, as was clearly the case with
                                     538

David Souter when President Bush put his name forward. Nor do I in
any other way challenge Mrs. Ginsburg's nomination on grounds of
personal character.

          I do, however, urge that Mrs. Ginsburg's nomination be rejected
by the Senate on grounds that the standard of judgment she would bring
to the Supreme Court on the overriding issue of whether the Constitu-
tion protects our God-given right to life, is a wrong standard.

          Instead of defending the humanity and divinely imparted right to
life of pre-born children, she would simply be another vote for the
proposition that our unborn children are less than human and that
their lives may be snuffed out without due process of law, and with
impunity.

         As a matter of practice and belief, Mrs. Ginsburg has failed to
acknowledge or recognize that the first duty of the law is indeed the
defense of innocent human life.

         If it is Mrs. Ginsburg's position and it does seem to be her
view that the extinguishment of innocent unborn human lives, without
due process of law, is not only Constitutionally permissible, but that
those who engage in the practice of destroying unborn lives should
enjoy Constitutional protection for doing so, she may have a perspec-
tive consistent with that held by members of this committee, but it is
not one which is consistent with either the plain language of the
Constitution or with the revulsion toward abortion which prevailed at
the time when our Constitution was drafted and ratified.

         While Mrs. Ginsburg has disagreed with the reasoning in Roe v.
Wade, at no point has she expressed dissatisfaction with the millions
of legal abortions which were facilitated by that decision, even
though she would have argued that "discrimination" rather than
"privacy" was the core issue.

         By Mrs. Ginsburg's logic, it is unconstitutional discrimination
to deny females the opportunity to extinguish any lives which may
result from their sexual conduct. Her argument would seem to be with
our Creator, inasmuch as he did not equally assign the same childbear-
ing function to males. Consistent with her warped perspective, Mrs.
Ginsburg, as a litigator, argued that pregnancy should be treated as a
disability rather than as a gift from God.

         Indeed, in a 1972 brief, Mrs. Ginsburg argued that "exaltation of
                                     539

woman's unique role in bearing children has, in effect, restrained
women from developing their individual talents...and has impelled them
to accept a dependent, subordinate status in society."'

         Moreover, in 1984, in a speech at the University of North
Carolina, Mrs. Ginsburg went so far as to maintain that the government
has a legal "duty" to use taxpayer funds to subsidize abortion.

         The question of personhood, and of the humanity of the pre-born
child is at the very heart of the abortion issue in law, in morals,
and in fact.

         Justice John Paul Stevens expressed his opinion in the 1986
Thornburgh case that "there is a fundamental and well-recognized
difference between a fetus and a human being". He admitted that
"indeed, if there is not such a difference, the permissibility of
terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of
the state legislatures."2

          In the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court indicated that if
the unborn child is a person, the State could not allow abortion, even
to save the life of the mother. In fact, in the majority opinion
deciding Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court said that, if the "personhood
 [of the unborn child] is established, [the pro-abortion] case, of
course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaran-
teed specifically by the [Fourteenth] Amendment."3

         Although my reasoning is different, I agree with Justice Stevens
when he argues that, if the unborn child is recognized as a human
person, there is no Constitutional basis to justify Federal protection
of abortion anywhere in the United States of America. Indeed, on the
contrary, if the pre-born child is, in fact, a human person created in
God's image, premeditated abortion is unconstitutional in every one of
the fifty states.

         Justice Stevens bases his reasoning on the Fourteenth Amendment.
I base mine on Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, which
stipulates that "The United States shall guarantee to every State in

           Struck v. Secretary of Defense, 1972 (The New Republic, 8/2/93, p. 19)
           Supreme Court decision 6/10/86: Richard Thornburgh v. American College of
           Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Justice John Paul Stevens concurring
           Supreme Court decision, 1/22/73: Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry Blackmun writing the
           majority opinion
                                    540

this Union a Republican Form of Government...." What distinguishes a
republic from a democracy is the fact that, in our republic, due
process protections of our God-given rights to life, liberty, and
property cannot properly be snuffed out by legislative whim whether
reflected in the vote of a simple majority, a super majority of two-
thirds or three-fourths, or even by unanimous vote.

         Mrs. Ginsburg should be closely questioned by members of the
Judiciary Committee concerning whether she believes the unborn child
is a human person created in God's image.

         If this is not her understanding (and it does not seem to b e ) ,
she should be asked to indicate by what logic she reaches a contrary
conclusion.

         The Constitution of the United States accords this body the right
to provide advice and consent with respect to the judicial nominees of
the President. As I read the Constitution, you can confirm a nominee
for any reason you choose. Moreover, you can reject a nominee for any
reason you choose.

         There are two categories of review which, in every case involving
a nominee to our highest court, ought to be part of the confirmation
process: One, is the nominee a person whose character, judgment, and
ability is compatible with the office? A second factor to be consid-
ered in the case of Supreme Court nominees is whether the r ninee can
reasonably be expected to render judgement in a manner which is
faithful to the Constitution, taking care to honor its specific words
rather than to rely on interpretations of the Constitution which are
clearly inconsistent with its plain meaning.

         It has been reported4 concerning Mrs. Ginsburg that "Several of
her writings provide a glimpse into her approach to the Constitution.
In an article in Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice,
she wrote that *a too strict jurisprudence of the framers' original
intent seems to me unworkable.' She went on to write that adherence
to xour eighteenth century Constitution' is dependent on 'change in
society's practices, constitutional amendment, and judicial interpre-
tation.' Furthermore, in the Washington University Law Quarterly, she
remarked that xboldly dynamic interpretation departing radically from

           Andrew P. Zappia: Law and Inequality, Vol. 6, Number 1, pp. 17-25, May 1988
                                    541

the original understanding' of the Constitution is sometimes neces-
sary."5

         "In a speech this March at New York University, Judge Ginsburg
advocated using the Supreme Court to enact * social change.'....

         " without taking giant strides...the court, through constitu-
tional adjudication, can reinforce or signal a green light for social
change."'

         It is not surprising that different people might reach different
conclusions about the intent of the Framers. But it is quite another
thing for a prospective Justice of the Supreme Court to presume to
substitute his or her own opinion for the plain meaning of the
original document as lawfully amended. I hope the members of the
committee will probe more deeply into Mrs. Ginsburg's present view of
the opinion she expressed in that article. If she is unwilling to
repudiate it credibly and entirely, then, even aside from her apparent
failure to recognize the duty of the state to safeguard innocent
humanity, she would seem to have disqualified herself from a position
in which she is expected to be a guardian of the Constitution.
Otherwise, a vote to confirm Mrs. Ginsburg becomes a vote to empower a
permanent one-woman Constitutional Convention which never goes out of
session.

         Indeed, in view of the position taken by Mrs. Ginsburg that it is
the duty of Supreme Court justices to disregard the plain words and
intentions of the Constitution, it is particularly important that her
personal opinions be closely scrutinized.

         As you know, it is the practice of judges below the Supreme Court
level to indicate deference to the decisions of the Supreme Court, and
to avoid the appearance of competing with the Supreme Court in
breaking new Constitutional ground.

         There are those who argue that Mrs. Ginsburg's performance as a
judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia stands
in clear contrast with her role as advocate when she was in private
practice and when she functioned as general counsel of the American
Civil Liberties Union. But, it would be a mistake to conclude that

          Ltgml Times, 7/12/93, "An Activist in Moderate Garb" by Mark R. Levin and Andrew
          P. Zappia: Washington University Law Quarterly, 1979 Volume, beginning p. 161.
          Terry Jeffrey, The Washington Times, 7/20/93, p. F4
                                     542

Mrs. Ginsburg's performance on the Court of Appeals is evidence that
she has abandoned her previous perspective or philosophy.

         The clear problem is that, at least at one point, as a mature
adult, a law school graduate and a seasoned attorney, Mrs. Ginsburg
expressed the view that it was not only the privilege, but the duty,
of Supreme Court Justices to become supreme legislators, supplanting
the Founding Fathers in determining the scope and meaning of our
organic law, the Constitution of the United States.

         For this reason, Mrs. Ginsburg's views on virtually every subject
which might conceivably be addressed by the Supreme Court are relevant
to the consideration of this body.

         Of course, it is my view that a Supreme Court nominee who sees
her role as that of supreme legislator should, ipso facto, be disqual-
ified. But, I have no doubt that there are many in this body who,
presuming that they will agree with Mrs. Ginsburg's policy conclu-
sions, intend to set aside any concerns they might have on that score.

         It is, therefore, the particular obligation of those who might
disagree with Mrs. Ginsburg's ideology and policy objectives to either
oppose her nomination on the basis of such disagreement, or to hence-
forth cease their personal professions of conviction on those particu-
lar issues whether they relate to abortion, to homosexuality, or to
some other issue where Mrs. Ginsburg's philosophical predilections are
a matter of public record.

         For example, the records of the American Civil Liberties Union
disclose that, Mrs. Ginsburg, as a member of the ACLU board, voted to
oppose the authority of state governments to preserve laws prohibiting
prostitution and homosexuality. She opposed the right of the Federal
government to screen out homosexuals from the military, and she even
attacked the right of state and local governments to arrest and
prosecute adult sex offenders who prey upon the young.7

         I would argue that those Senators who believe that states and
communities have a right of self-defense against the threats to public
health and public morals posed by homosexual conduct should act on
their professed concerns by voting against the confirmation of Mrs.
Ginsburg.

          Human Events, 7/3/93, "Ruth Ginsburg's .Hole With the ACLU" by Bill Donohue
                                  543

         Similarly, if you sincerely believe that homosexual conduct is
incompatible with military service, you cannot, conscientiously or
consistently, vote to confirm Mrs. Ginsburg because as an unelected
Supreme Court legislator she could be expected to regularly vote to
overturn not only your opinion but that of your constituents.

         In the same vein, is it not clear that Mrs. Ginsburg's view of
the Fourteenth Amendment would preclude any distinctions being drawn
on the basis of gender with respect to the assignment of women to
combat?

         And whether or not Mrs. Ginsburg has expressed, or even devel-
oped, a clearly defined view on other issues of Constitutional import,
I would suggest that they are worth raising not just in terms of her
philosophical conformity to prevailing opinion, but in seeking to
discern her willingness to accord overriding consideration to the
original intentions of the Framers.

         This committee has, over the years, asked Supreme Court nominees
questions in detail on a variety of subjects ranging from contracep-
tion to bilingual ballots, but it has not probed in depth the views of
the nominees on other issues of Constitutional significance.

         By way of illustration, this year, this Senate is scheduled to
conduct hearings on the question of D.C. statehood, what is the
opinion of the nominee with respect to Article I, Section 8 of the
Constitution, which makes clear that, without Constitutional amend-
ment, the District of Columbia must operate as a Federal city under
the jurisdiction of laws approved by the Congress?

         What is the opinion of the nominee with respect to the Second
Amendment? On what basis does she believe that Congress may be
authorised to restrict the right of the people to keep and bear arms?
Would she concede that the people have a Constitutional right to
effective self-defense by bearing arms-->a right reserved to them
under the Ninth Amendment as well as the Second?

         How does the nominee interpret that provision in Article I,
Section 8, which extends to Congress not to the President, not to
the GATT, and not to NAFTA the authority to "regulate commerce"?

         The Constitution gives Congress authority "to coin money, regu-
late the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of
weights and measures". Our Federal Reserve system is clearly incon-
                                 544

sistent with this Constitutional provision. What is the nominee's
conclusion concerning this?

          The First Amendment says "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion". Do not subsidies to educational and
cultural entities inescapably involve the funding of activities which
are religious in character? If so, is it not unconstitutional for the
Federal government to subsidize such entities, even those which are
purportedly secular?

          Is it not in conflict with the First Amendment to require
taxpayers to subsidize a National Endowment for the Arts, which
underwrites some highly parochial views concerning the nature of God
and man?

         What is her opinion of the wanton destruction of human life in
Waco, Texas and in Ruby Creek, Idaho initiated lawlessly by the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Department
of Justice?

         Is the nominee willing to literally apply the Tenth Ai: ndment to
the Constitution, which states unequivocally that the powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by
it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to the
people?

         Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Mrs. Ginsburg's nomina-
tion should be rejected:

         As a Justice, she would not safeguard the God-given right to
life. She would further subvert it. Freed of the constraints which
tend to bind lower court judges to the decisions of the Supreme Court,
we are obliged, on the record, to assume she would act on her belief
that it is necessary to offer interpretations which depart radically
from the original meaning of the Constitution.

         And, rather than protect the Constitutional prerogatives of the
Congress to set policy, it seems clear that Mrs. Ginsburg would, at
least in some crucial areas, seek to establish herself as a "super-
legislator" .

         I urge you to recall the words of Thomas Jefferson who recognized
the danger of allowing members of the judiciary to sbustitute their
own preferences for the clear intention of the Framers of the Consti-
tution. In 1804 he warned that:
                                    545

"...the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what
laws are Constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their
own sphere of action, but for the legislature and executive also in
their spheres, would make the judiciary a despotic branch."*

         The members of the Senate in general, and of this committee in
particular, have a unique responsibility to preserve not only the
prerogatives of the Congress in relation to those of the Judiciary,
but of the people with respect to the government.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much for your testimony, and
I have no questions. It seems very clear that your statements are
crisp and self-explanatory, as were the previous panels', and I have
no questions.

  I yield to my friend from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I want to welcome all of you here. I appre-
ciate having your testimony. I have to say that your point, Ms.
Cunningham, that through all those Reagan-Bush years both of
those Presidents were accused of using the litmus test on abortion
for the selection of their Supreme Court nominees--it is pretty ap-
parent that they did not, and having known who did the vetting
down there, who used to be a staff member of mine, I know they
didn't. Yet, in this particular case there is no question that there
was an abortion test.
  But then again, this President won the election and, frankly, he
has picked a Supreme Court nominee and I have to say that I per-
sonally disagree with her on this issue, but she is an excellent per-
son and a fine judicial scholar, and I have said other things as well.
But I appreciate having your testimony. I think it takes courage to
come in and to express your viewpoints and the viewpoints of mil-
lions of people out there with regard to some of the problems sur-
rounding this very important issue, and we appreciate having the
testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Feinstein.
  Senator FEINSTEIN. I have no questions other than to say I ap-
preciate your point of view. I managed to hear most of the testi-
mony and appreciate it very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no ques-
tions. I join my colleagues in thanking you for coming in. I think
it is very important that this committee hear your views and con-
sider them. Thank you all very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me state one thing, if I may, before I dismiss
the panel. It is true that during the nomination, if my recollection
serves me correctly, the President did say he would, in fact, look
for and appoint someone who holds the view that they are, quote,
"pro-choice," I think was the phrase he used.
  At the time, I publicly criticized that view because I don't think
there should be any test. But with regard to the more narrow issue
of whether or not this nominee was, to use the phrase the Senator
from Utah used, vetted, which is sort of a term of art used up
here--you remember those days, Kay--that question was specifi-
cally asked of the nominee and answered.
  The question was--and I would ask that this be entered in the
record, the whole question. I will read part of it:

  Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee (includ-
ing but not limited to a member of the White House staff, the Justice Department,
or the Senate or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal issue or ques-
tion in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or im-
plied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or question.

and it goes on from there.
  The answer to the question by the nominee is,
                                                  547

  I repeated on June 14, 1993, just after the President announced his nomination
for the Supreme Court vacancy, that a judge is bound to decide each case fairly,
in accord with the relevant facts and the applicable law.

It goes on to say,

  No such person discussed with me any specific case, legal issue or question in a
manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied as-
surances concerning my position on such case, issue, or question.

  During the six months prior to the announcement of my nomination, I had no
communication with any member of the White House staff, the Justice Department
or the Senate or its staff referring or relating to my views on any case, issue or sub-
ject that could come before the United States Supreme Court.

  [The question and answer referred to follow:]

  Question. Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nomi-
nee (including but not limited to a member of the White House staff, the Justice
Department, or the Senate or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal
issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any
express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or ques-
tion? If so, please explain fully. Please identify each communication you had during
the 6 months prior to the announcement of your nomination with any member of
the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate or its staff referring
or relating to your views on any case, issue or subject that could come before the
United States Supreme Court, state who was present or participated in such com-
munication, and describe briefly what transpired.

  Answer. I repeated on June 14, 1993, just after the President announced his nom-
ination for the Supreme Court vacancy, that a judge is bound to decide each case
fairly, in accord with the relevant facts and the applicable law. The day a judge is
tempted to be guided, instead, by what "the home crowd wants" is the day that
judge should resign and pursue other work. It is inappropriate, in my judgment, to
seek from any nominee for judicial office assurance on how that individual would
rule in a future case. That judgment was shared by those involved in the process
of selecting me. No such person discussed with me any specific case, legal issue or
question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express
or implied assurances concerning my position on such case, issue, or question.

   During the six months prior to the annoucement of my nomination, I had no com-
munication with any member of the White Hous staff, the Justice Department or
the Senate or its staff referring or relating to my views on any case, issue or subject
that could come before the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, that may be a distinction in practical effect
without a difference, but it is not a distinction without a difference
as it relates to whether or not the issue that was before us in the
past, and will be before us with every nominee while it is included
as far as anyone, when asked and nominated or considered or being
vetted, is asked a specific position on a specific issue. That is in the
record.

  I will ask, since the nominee is still under oath for purposes of
questions that are submitted to her in writing--although this is the
same effect, but for precision reasons and for strict legal reasons,
I will ask this question to be submitted, along with the others that
are being submitted on other matters, to the nominee so we have
on the record from the nominee under oath whether or not the as-
sertion made by her in this questionnaire is precisely accurate.

  I thank you all.
   Senator HATCH. Could I just add one other thing? I was inter-
ested in the Washington Post's editorial--I believe it was today--
on litmus tests. The point that needs to be made is that this Sen-
ator rejects the concept that any single litmus test should stop
somebody from serving on the Supreme Court because if we start
deciding who serves there purely on political grounds, then we will
politicize that institution which I think means so much to all of us.
                                                548

  It is precisely that position that I think rebuts that editorial be-
cause we have had Senators on this committee say that they will
not vote for somebody who does not support Roe V. Wade, and I
think that is wrong. I think that no single issue rises to the dignity
of foreclosing the right of people to serve on the Supreme Court,
as important as all of you believe this to be and as important as
I believe it to be.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator, may I respectfully say that while you may
choose to vote for or against on any other basis, it is in that same
spirit clear from the Constitution that every Senator may, for any
reason, choose to confirm or any reason choose to reject.

  Senator HATCH. Oh, sure.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. And I would argue that the question of equal pro-
tection of innocent life, the defense of the unborn, is more impor-
tant than the color of our hair or the neckties we choose to wear,
and that the Supreme Court has, in effect, been permitted to be-
come a supreme legislature.
  We are kidding ourselves if we believe that the Supreme Court
is not a political body. As Charles Evans Hughes said very elo-
quently in Riley at an early point, the Constitution is what the
members of the Supreme Court say it is. I don't happen to agree
with that, but that is the prevailing situation.
  Senator HATCH. I have made some of those same arguments, but
my point is that it is one thing to criticize for litmus tests when
people hold candidates or nominees liable for them, and it is an-
other thing to criticize for litmus tests when they don't. Frankly,
I don't think that there should be a single litmus test.
  Sure, the Supreme Court has its political aspects, but it is the
least politicized institution in our society, and I would like to keep
it that way as much as I can. I think there is a difference, and it
is a significant difference, and personally I felt that the editorial
was somewhat anti-intellectual.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. The American people have manifested growing dis-
satisfaction with their political system, with the accountability of
that system, and that is because very often those whom they elect
to office, professing to take a particular position on a certain issue,
in office do not vote in a manner consistent with that. That is one
of the reasons I am trying to build a new political party called the
U.S. Taxpayers Party.
  Senator HATCH. I understand that.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. There are a number of Senators in the Republican
Party, in particular, who profess to take a strong prolife position
who, in fact, know that in voting for the confirmation of Ms. Gins-
burg they are voting to advance the cause of abortion, and I think
that is a tragedy and, frankly, I think it is a violation of the good-
faith commitments which were made to the electorate by them.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I respectfully disagree with you on that be-
cause I think that the place to make the change is in the legisla-
ture, not in the Supreme Court. I think that the place to make the
change is in the elected representatives of the people. As you and
I both well know, the vast majority of Members of Congress are not
on our side on this issue and we have been losing regularly, except
with regard to Federal funding of abortion.
                                      549

  So don't try and change the Supreme Court in the sense of politi-
cizing it and electing people who will be prolife. I think that we
have got to do is elect people who--by the way, I think you could
have started with the President of the United States last time. We
now have a President who believes this way and he has picked a
person who believes this way, and he has a right to do so and that
is the point.

  Well, we could argue about it all day. All I can say is the place
to change it is in the Congress of the United States, not the Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator, and I want reiterate what
Senator Feinstein said. It is important that your viewpoint be rep-
resented, and it is important that the American people hear a dif-
ferent perspective on this issue, and we thank you for being here
to do that, and you have all delivered your point of view concisely
and well. So thank you very much for being here.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you for your courtesy. We appreciate it.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, our last, but certainly not our least panel
is comprised of the presidents of three additional bar associations:
California Women Lawyers, Hispanic National Bar Association,
and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. We all
know New York is an independent, standing nation in and of itself.
That is kind of a joke.
  At any rate, every time I say this to Mr.--is it pronounced
Feerick?
  Mr. FEERICK. Yes, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Feerick, I am always reminded of that poster
of one of the leading political figures in American politics of the
day, and probably the most dynamic--Mr. Wiesenfeld is here, too?
Would he come forward, too? He was on the last panel, but would
he come forward as well?
  I am reminded of that poster that they sell in New York, which
is my favorite city in the country, a picture of this very significant
American politician, one of the dynamic forces in American politics
today, standing on Seventh Avenue and astride Seventh Avenue. It
is a map of the United States, and Seventh Avenue is in stark re-
lief and California is minuscule as he looks out over the Nation,
which has always sort of been my view of how most New Yorkers
view the world and the Nation. There is New York and then there
is the rest. The New York City Bar Association is one of the only
city bar associations that asks to testify, and I know its members
are clear that from their perspective, it is more important than the
New York State Bar Association.
  Thank you for your good humor. It is getting late in the process,
and I apologize for my digression here.
  Angela M. Bradstreet is the current president of California
Women Lawyers, which probably has more members than the con-
stituents in my entire State.
  Ms. BRADSTREET. That is correct, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW many members, Angela?
  Ms. BRADSTREET. 30,000, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO; our State is bigger than that.
  It is the largest women's bar association in America. She is also
a partner at Carroll, Burdick and McDonough in San Francisco. Is
that correct?
                                                    550

  Ms. BRADSTREET. That is correct, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Carlos Ortiz is the national president of the His-
panic National Bar and has been before this committee--the bar
has been represented here and is one of the premier organizations
in the country, and we are delighted to have you here to testify.
  John Feerick is the president of the Association of the Bar of the
City of New York. He is also the dean of one of the fine law schools
in the country, Fordham Law School.
  Also from a previous panel--and we apologize if we have con-
fused you, Mr. Wiesenfeld, as to when we were going to ask you
to be here, but thank you for being here. I am looking for your bio
here as I go through my--anyway, you were a client of the soon-
to-be-Justice.
  Mr. WIESENFELD. Stephen Wiesenfeld from Weinberger v.
Wiesenfeld.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, but we had more information about you as
well I was going to read in the record, but if you are satisfied with
that description and that introduction we'll let it stand.
  Why don't we begin in the order that I have asked you to testify
and, Ms. Bradstreet, why don't you begin your testimony. Thank
you for coming across the country to be here.

PANEL CONSISTING OF ANGELA M. BRADSTREET, CALIFOR-
  NIA WOMEN LAWYERS, SAN FRANCISCO, CA; CARLOS G.
  ORTIZ, PRESIDENT, HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION;
  JOHN D. FEERICK, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF THE BAR
  OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK; AND STEPHEN WIESENFELD,
  FORT LAUDERDALE, FL

               STATEMENT OF ANGELA M. BRADSTREET

  Ms. BRADSTREET. Thank you, Senator. It has been the thrill of
a lifetime.

  Chairman Biden, distinguished members of this committee, I am
deeply honored to be here on behalf of California Women Lawyers
to express our strong support of President Clinton's nomination of
Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court.

  California Women Lawyers is, in fact, the largest women's bar
association in the Nation, representing the interests of over 30,000
women attorneys in the State of California.

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me for interrupting. When you say rep-
resent the interests, does that mean there are 30,000 women who
are dues-paying members of the bar association?

  Ms. BRADSTREET. We have about 10,000 who are actually dues-
paying members of our organization, Senator.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Ms. BRADSTREET. By the way, I did get the statistics for your
State, if you are interested.

   The CHAIRMAN. I am.

  Ms. BRADSTREET. Well, I got them from the American Bar Asso-
ciation yesterday, and there are 495 women attorneys out of a total
of 2,150.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, 25 percent; we are getting there.

   Ms. BRADSTREET. Yes.
                                      551

  Our mission, Senator, is the advancement of women in the legal
profession and the complete eradication of gender bias in our soci-
ety. We are privileged to currently be assisting Senator Feinstein
in her tireless work on issues affecting women, and it is a special
honor to be appearing before our first senior woman Senator from
California.

  After a thorough and formal evaluation process involving a re-
view of her legal opinions, cases argued, writings, and interviews
with respected peers which examined her intellectual qualifica-
tions, judicial temperament, lack of bias, and analytical skills, Cali-
fornia Women Lawyers found Judge Ruth Ginsburg to merit the
highest rating possiole to serve as an Associate Justice.

  Judge Ginsburg's contribution as a pioneer of women's rights
cannot be overstated, for, as has been noted, she won five of the
most important sex discrimination cases that have ever before been
argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. Indeed, the
case of Frontiero has been hailed as a landmark decision in estab-
lishing gender parity as a consitutional mandate in the workplace.

  When only 20 years ago she persuaded a majority of Justices
that a law which, in essence, denied a working woman equal pay
to a working man, Judge Ginsburg forged not only a dynamic rein-
terpretation of the equal protection clause, but also a fundamental
positive change in society's previous stereotypical attitudes toward
women in the workplace.

  Her explicit recognition that, and I quote:

   The shape of the law on gender-based classification indicates and influences the
opportunity women will have to participate as men's full partners in the Nation's
social, political and economic life.

is cause for great optimism that this nominee's presence on the Su-
preme Court will make a major difference in the achievement of
complete gender equality for all.

  Her prolific writings also demonstrate that Judge Ginsburg rec-
ognizes and will work earnestly to protect a woman's right to
choose. Her approach to choice, suggesting that a constitutionally
protected sex-equality perspective should also be adopted, in addi-
tion to a due process privacy perspective, is a well-reasoned one,
for the notion that we as women should be in control of our own
destiny is crucial to our attaining an equal place in society.

  It is therefore, Mr. Chairman, particularly apt that the appoint-
ment of one who has paved the way for women's equality as the
second woman Justice on the Supreme Court should symbolize an
historic departure from the tokenism that has traditionally existed
in the appointment of women to positions of power.

  With still only 14.5 percent of circuit court positions and barely
13 percent of district court positions being filled by women today,
Judge Ginsburg's appointment to the highest court in the land will
take this Nation a giant step forward in shattering the glass ceiling
of our legal profession and indeed in other professions, too.

  In conclusion, California Women Lawyers most respectfully urges
the distinguished members of this committee to vote in favor of the
nomination of this outstanding woman to whom all women today
owe a great debt.

  Thank you so much.

                           PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANGELA M. BRADSTREET

  Senator Biden and distinguished Senators: I am deeply honored to be here on be-
half of California Women Lawyers to express our strong support of President Clin-
ton's nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as an Associate Justice of the Unit-
ed States Supreme Court.

  California Women Lawyers is the largest women's bar association in the nation,
representing the interests of over 30,000 women attorneys in the State of California.
Our mission is the advancement of women in the legal profession and the eradi-
cation of all forms of gender bias in our society generally. We are privileged to cur-
rently be assisting Senator Dianne Feinstein in her tireless work on issues affecting
women.

  After a thorough and formal evaluation process involving a review of her legal
opinions, cases argued, writings and interviews with respected peers, which exam-
ined her intellectual qualifications, judicial temperament, lack of bias and analytical
skills, California Women Lawyers found Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to merit the
highest legal rating possible to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
that is, exceptionally well qualified.

  Judge Ginsburg's contribution as a pioneer of women's rights cannot be over-
stated. For she won five of the most important sex discrimination cases that have
ever been argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. Indeed, the case
of Frontiero v. Richardson has been hailed as a landmark decision in establishing
gender parity as a constitutional mandate in the workplace. When twenty years ago
she persuaded a majority of the Justices that a law automatically allowing married
men in the military, but not married women, medical care benefits for a spouse in
essence denied a working women equal pay to a working man, Judge Ginsburg
forged not only a dynamic reinterpretation of the equal protection clause, but also
a fundamental change in society's previous stereotypical attitudes towards women
in the workplace.

  Indeed her explicit recognition that "the shape of the law on gender based classi-
fication * * * indicates and influences the opportunity women will have to partici-
pate as men's full partners in the nation's social, political and economic life" (Some
Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to Roe v. Wade, R. Ginsburg, 63
N. Carolina L.R., 375) is cause for great optimism that this nominee's presence on
the Supreme Court will make a major difference in the achievement of complete
gender equality for all.

  Her prolific writings also clearly demonstrate that Judge Ginsburg recognizes,
and will work earnestly to protect, a woman's right to choose. Her approach to
choice, suggesting that a constitutionally protected sex-equality perspective should
be adopted, rather than simply a due process privacy perspective, is a well reasoned
one. For, the notion that we as women should be in control of our own destiny is
crucial to our attaining an equal place in society.

  It is, therefore, particularly apt that the appointment of one who has paved the
way for women's equality all of her life as the second woman Justice on the Su-
preme Court of the United States should symbolize an historic departure from the
tokenism that has traditionally existed in the appointment of women to positions
of power. With still only 14.5 percent of Circuit Court positions and barely 13 per-
cent of District Court positions filled by women today (U.S. Department of Justice),
Judge Ginsburg's appointment to the highest court in the land will take this nation
a giant step forward in shattering the legal glass ceiling.

  In conclusion, California Women Lawyers applauds President Clinton for his out-
standing nomination and I respectfully urge the distinguished members of this Com-
mittee to vote in favor of this nomination.

  Thank you very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much for your testimony.
  Mr. President. It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

                  STATEMENT OF CARLOS G. ORTIZ
  Mr. ORTIZ. It sounds OK.
  Thank you very much, Chairman Biden and members of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. I bring you greetings from the many
thousands of Hispanic-American attorneys from around the coun-
try, many of whom are your constituents in your respective States.
  On behalf of the Hispanic National Bar Association, I want to
tell you that we are privileged to once again appear before your
                                                553

committee. We have testified in four of the last five nominations,
I believe, now, and we take it very seriously and consider it very
important.

  The CHAIRMAN. And we take your views very seriously.
  Mr. ORTIZ. Thank you. Based upon the HNBA's investigation,
Senator, and review of Judge Ginsburg's record, we support her
nomination and we find that she is highly qualified to serve on the
U.S. Supreme Court.
  The HNBA is the only national organization that represents
thousands of Hispanic American attorneys throughout this country.
The HNBA has supported and opposed judicial nominees across the
political spectrum. Therefore, we do not expect nominees to adhere
to any particular ideology. Instead, we review a person's overall
record, scholarship and philosophy. In each of these areas, Judge
Ginsburg has an exceptional record, particularly in her path-break-
ing litigation on behalf of women victimized by discriminatory poli-
cies and practices.
  Many Hispanics, including many thousands of Hispanic women
across the Nation, have been the beneficiaries of her legal reform
efforts, which are in the finest American legal tradition. Judge
Ginsburg enjoys a reputation as an extraordinarily intelligent stu-
dent of the law. Her academic record is excellent, as you have al-
ready heard from numerous witnesses. Judge Ginsburg has a stel-
lar record as a law professor and as a prolific scholar on women's
rights, comparative law, and civil procedure, again, as you have
heard from many speakers that have preceded us.
  As an advocate, Judge Ginsburg played a pivotal role in women's
causes. Judge Ginsburg has an exemplary record of advocacy for
civil rights and equal protection of women in America, and it is
therefore our hope that Judge Ginsburg will be equally committed
to equal protection and justice for Hispanic Americans and other
minorities who continue to suffer the abuses and indignities of rac-
ism and discrimination in America.
  The discrimination Hispanic Americans experience is widespread
and varied. For example, an anti-immigrant sentiment is growing
throughout our Nation. It has been caused in part by the slowdown
in the economy and threatens the civil rights of all Hispanics, as
well as other minorities residing in this country.
  Another example of the injustices suffered by Hispanic Ameri-
cans is the same sort of employment discrimination suffered by
Judge Ginsburg herself merely because of her gender when she at-
tempted to enter the job market upon graduation from law school.
Employment discrimination is a daily experience for many His-
panic Americans. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans
nationally and in many of the States you represent, like Illinois,
Arizona, California, Massachusetts, is tragically high, and even
those Hispanics who have attained a college education are con-
fronted with a glass ceiling barring their promotion and advance-
ment.
  To remedy these and other social ills afflicting Hispanics, the
Hispanic community will be increasingly turning to the courts and
ultimately to the Supreme Court for relief and for enforcement of
our civil and constitutional rights.
                                                   554

  As a jurist, Judge Ginsburg has had an equally outstanding ca-
reer. Having carefully reviewed her opinions, the HNBA finds
Judge Ginsburg to be fair and conscientious. Her opinions call for
the equal treatment and advancement of all those who live within
our country's boundaries. Judge Ginsburg has responded sensi-
tively to the needs of our country's women and minorities. She has
been on the side of change--change toward shared participation by
all members of our society in our Nation's economic and social life.
Her work has been devoted to a broad vision of participatory de-
mocracy.

  The HNBA knows that Judge Ginsburg will bring to the Su-
preme Court her unique and sensitive life experiences. We hope
that she is able to project her life experiences of gender and reli-
gious discrimination to the plight of discrimination against His-
panic-Americans in many forms, including education, employment,
housing, voting rights, immigration, health, social services, et
cetera, and the list goes on and on.

  Other victims of discrimination share our high hopes for Judge
Ginsburg as Justice Ginsburg also. They believe that, given her
outstanding leadership in fighting gender discrimination, Judge
Ginsburg would likely be sensitive to discrimination across-the-
board.

  On a related and important note, we urge you, the members of
this committee, to remember that the Hispanic community today
faces the same formidable barriers of neglect and opposition that
Judge Ginsburg encountered in her early career. In your own judi-
cial recommendations, nominations and confirmations, we encour-
age you to draw from among the talented pool of Hispanic-Ameri-
cans throughout our country's legal communities.

  We also ask you to pay particular attention to the pressing need
for Hispanic-Americans to sit and serve with distinction on the Na-
tion's Federal courts, especially in such States as Illinois and Mas-
sachusetts where significant populations of Hispanic-Americans
have never had an Hispanic Federal judge. We hope you will con-
tinue to view the HNBA as a resource in helping to make our Na-
tion a better place for all Americans.

  Before concluding our statement, we must express our sincere
hope that the next nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court who comes
before the Senate Judiciary Committee will be an Hispanic-Amer-
ican. Just as we believe the Nation will benefit from the appoint-
ment of Judge Ginsburg, we also strongly believe that our Nation
needs and would greatly benefit from an Hispanic American--actu-
ally, the first ever Hispanic-American Supreme Court Justice.

  In closing, the HNBA finds Judge Ginsburg highly qualified to
serve on the United States Supreme Court and we look forward to
her distinguished service.

  Thank you.

            PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION

  Chairman Biden, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:
  The Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) is privileged to present testimony
to this Committee. Based upon the HNBA's investigation and review of Judge Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, we support her nomination and find that she is highly qualified
to serve on the United States Supreme Court.
                                                   555

  The HNBA is the only national organization that represents thousands of His-
panic American attorneys throughout this country. The HNBA is a nonpartisan or-
ganization, and has supported and opposed judicial nominees across the political
spectrum. Therefore, we do not expect nominees to adhere to any particular ideol-
ogy, instead, we review a person's overall record, scholarship, and philosophy. In
each of these areas, Judge Ginsburg has an exceptional record, particularly in her
pathbreaking litigation on behalf of women victimized by discriminatory policies and
practices. Many Hispanics have been the beneficiaries of her legal reform efforts,
which are in the finest American legal tradition.

  One of Judge Ginsburg's former classmates (now a state Supreme Court Justice
in New Jersey) has described her as an extraordinarily intelligent student who was
never arrogant about her intelligence. Her academic record is excellent. This is re-
flected in her graduation with honors from Cornell University and from Harvard
and Columbia Law Schools.

  Judge Ginsburg has a stellar record as a law professor, and as a prolific scholar
in women's rights, comparative law, and civil procedure. She enjoyed a reputation
for devotion to her students and to her scholarship. As a professor, Judge Ginsburg
was a pioneer, becoming the first woman in the history of Columbia Law School to
become a full professor and only the second woman to be hired by Rutgers Law
School-Newark. Her publications are significant, reflecting insight and expertise in
many areas.

  As an advocate, Judge Ginsburg played a pivotal role in women's causes. While
serving as counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union, she won five of six gender
bias cases argued before the United States Supreme Court. She saw the need for
action against gender discrimination and fashioned an incremental strategy to fight
it. Judge Ginsburg has an exemplary record of advocacy for the civil rights and
equal protection of women in America, and it is therefore our hope that Judge Gins-
burg will be equally committed to equal protection and justice for Hispanic Ameri-
cans, who continue to suffer the abuses and indignities of racism and discrimination
in America.

   The discrimination Hispanic Americans experience is widespread and varied. For
example, an anti-immigrant sentiment is growing throughout our nation. This anti-
immigrant sentiment has been caused in part by the slow-down of the economy and
threatens the civil rights of all Hispanics as well as other minorities residing in this
country. Moreover, Hispanics continue to be disproportionately represented in our
jails and prisons for many reasons rooted in discrimination, while largely under-rep-
resented in our colleges, universities, and institutions of higher education for those
same reasons. This has prompted the suggestion that we have dual systems of jus-
tice and of education in America.

  Another example of the injustices suffered by Hispanic Americans is the sort of
employment discrimination Judge Ginsburg herself faced when she attempted to
enter the job market upon graduation from law school. Despite her sterling aca-
demic record, Judge Ginsburg was denied a United States Supreme Court clerkship
and was turned away from numerous New York law firms because of her gender.
Employment Discrimination is a daily experience for many Hispanic Americans. The
unemployment rate for Hispanics in America is tragically high and even those His-
panics who have attained a college education are confronted with a "glass ceiling",
barring their promotion and advancement. To remedy these and other social ills af-
flicting Hispanics, we will be turning increasingly to the courts, and ultimately to
the Supreme Court, for relief and for enforcement of our civil and constitutional
rights.

   As a jurist, Judge Ginsburg has had an equally outstanding career. As a D.C. Cir-
cuit Court judge, Judge Ginsburg has addressed issues involving federal law on a
daily basis. Because of the unique subject matter jurisdiction of the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit Court, Judge Ginsburg's current judgeship provides her with an ex-
cellent background for dealing with issues that will come before the United States
Supreme Court. Judge Ginsburg is described as one who can bring people together
and is committed to a collegial attitude. Former colleagues describe Judge Ginsburg
as a healer who takes a very thoughtful, measured approach to problems. They have
stated that she can bring people together because of her ability to listen and be fair.
They believe she will have the ability to build consensus on the High Court.

   Having carefully reviewed her options, the HNBA finds Judge Ginsburg to be a
fair and conscientious judge. Her opinions call for the equal treatment and advance-
ment of all those who live within our country's boundaries. Judge Ginsburg has re-
sponded sensitively to the needs of our country's women and minorities. She has
been on the side of change--change toward shared participation by all members of
our society in our nation's economic and social life.
                                              556

  Judge Ginsburg lectured on the role of women and the Constitution at the 1987
Eighth Circuit Judicial Conference in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, she noted
that the Constitution, as written in 1787, was a document for white, propertied
adult males and she therefore rejected strict interpretation of the Framer s original
intent as an unworkable form of Constitutional interpretation. She stated, "We still
have, cherish and live under our eighteenth century Constitution because, through
a combination of three factors or forces--change in society's practices, constitutional
amendment, and judicial interpretation--a broadened system of participatory de-
mocracy has evolved, one in which we take just pride." Her life's work has been de-
voted to a broad vision of participatory democracy.

  The HNBA knows that Judge Ginsburg will bring to the Supreme Court her
unique life's experiences and sensitivity. We hope that she is able to project her
life's experience of gender and religious discrimination to the plights of discrimina-
tion against Hispanic Americans in many forms, including education, employment,
housing, voting, immigration, health, and social services, etc. Indeed, the HNBA
hopes mat Judge Ginsburg lives up to the 1987 speech that she gave in Colorado
Springs. Specifically, we applaud her perspective that judicial interpretation can
broaden the system of participatory democracy to include Hispanics to a greater de-
gree than has occurred in this country's past history.

  Other victims of discrimination share our high hopes for Judge Ginsburg as Jus-
tice Ginsburg. Anne H. Franke, counsel for the American Association of University
Professors said of Judge Ginsburg, "We are very impressed by her dedication to dis-
crimination cases. Having that kind of history of being a leader in the gender-dis-
crimination area means she would likely be sensitive to discrimination across the
board." Kenneth S. Tollett, an expert on desegregation law and a professor of higher
education at Howard University, predicts that Judge Ginsburg's experience with sex
discrimination would make her sensitive to problems facing African American stu-
dents and historically African American colleges and is optimistic about her judicial
perspective.

  Judge Ginsburg has often been mentioned as a prospect for the Supreme Court,
but that has neither prevented her from publicly addressing politically difficult and
complex issues nor from making her views known. This is the type of courage that
we expect of a United States Supreme Court Justice. The HNBA believes Justice
Ginsburg will be as courageous and insightful as a member of our nation's highest
court as she has been as an advocate for women, and as a judge on the Court of
Appeals.

  On a related and important note, we urge you to remember that the Hispanic
community today faces the same combination of neglect and opposition Judge Gins-
burg encountered in her early career. In your own judicial nominations, rec-
ommendations, and confirmations we encourage you to draw from among the tal-
ented pool of Hispanic Americans throughout our country's legal communities. The
formal and informal barriers we face are as formidable as those Judge Ginsburg
once encountered.

  It must be noted that while we are pleased with the nomination of Judge Gins-
burg, we are deeply disappointed that a Hispanic American has never been named
to the United States Supreme Court. The HNBA persists in urging that a voice be
given to the approximately 25 million Hispanic-Americans who now constitute the
second largest and the fastest growing minority group in our nation. If our nation's
highest court is to adequately reflect our nations population and avoid the risk of
losing its legitimacy, a Hispanic American must be appointed to the Court. Just as
we believe the nation will benefit from the appointment of Judge Ginsburg, we also
strongly believe that our nation needs--and would greatly benefit from--the ap-
pointment of a Hispanic American Supreme Court Justice.

  We also ask you to pay particular attention to the pressing need for more His-
panics to sit and to serve with distinction on the lower federal courts. Hispanic-
Americans are grossly under-represented in the judiciary in many regions of our na-
tion. Houston, Texas, for example, a city with a significant Hispanic population, has
no Hispanic federal judges. The state of Illinois has never had an Hispanic on any
of its federal courts. In our nation's capital, the District of Columbia Circuit Court
of Appeals, which will have a vacancy when Judge Ginsburg is elevated, has never
had an Hispanic appointment. Moreover, there is no active Hispanic American judge
today on any of our Circuit Courts of Appeals appointed by a Democratic President.
The HNBA stands ready to assist you in locating Hispanic American talent. The
HNBA has identified many highly qualified Hispanic American potential nominees.

  In closing, the HNBA finds Judge Ginsburg highly qualified to serve on the Unit-
ed States Supreme Court and we look forward to her distinguished service.

  Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I am willing to use the rest of my time
to respond to any questions or comments the Committee may have of the HNBA.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Feerick.

                      STATEMENT OF JOHN D. FEERICK

  Mr. FEERICK. Senator Biden and members of the committee, my
name is John Feerick and I am the current president of the Asso-
ciation of the Bar of the City of New York. I appreciate very much
the opportunity to testify today regarding the nomination of Judge
Ginsburg.

  I am joined by Helene Barnett, who sits immediately behind me,
who chaired the subcommittee of the governing body of our associa-
tion that conducted the evaluation on behalf of our association.

  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome, Ms. Barnett.
  Mr. FEERICK. AS this committee is aware, the Association of the
Bar of the City of New York is one of the oldest bar associations
in the country and, since its founding in 1870, has given priority
to the evaluations of candidates for judicial office. As far back as
1874, the association has reviewed and commented on the quali-
fications of candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a particu-
lar honor to participate in this confirmation process for this par-
ticular nominee, who is also a member of our association and
served on our executive committee from 1974 to 1978.
  In May 1987, our association adopted a policy that directs the ex-
ecutive committee, our governing body, to evaluate all candidates
for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. The executive commit-
tee has developed an extensive procedure for evaluating Supreme
Court nominees, including a process for conducting research, seek-
ing views of persons with knowledge of the candidate and of our
membership of more than 19,000 dues-paying members of the New
York and other bars. As well, we evaluate the information received
and express a judgment on the qualifications of a person for the
U.S. Supreme Court.
  Judge Ginsburg is the first nominee to be evaluated under our
recently adopted set of guidelines. The association's effort, as I
have already noted, was undertaken by a subcommittee of our ex-
ecutive committee and our committee on the judiciary, which joint
committee was chaired by Helene Barnett.
  In examining the qualifications of Judge Ginsburg, the following
materials were reviewed by our association: all of her more than
300 written opinions, concurrences and dissents while sitting on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; her pub-
lished articles and lectures; information relating to Judge Gins-
burg^s 1980 D.C. Circuit nomination and confirmation; comments
solicited from association members presented in writing and at a
forum held at our association; and news articles, commentaries and
other materials with regard to the nomination.
  Members of the executive committee also interviewed Judge
Ginsburg. In addition, dozens of interviews were conducted with
her judicial colleagues, academic colleagues, and former law clerks,
and lawyers who litigated with and against or argued before Judge
Ginsburg.
  Our executive committee, upon evaluating the qualifications of
Judge Ginsburg, passed a resolution at its meeting of July 14,
1993, finding her qualified to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme
                                              558

Court based on our committee's affirmative finding that she pos-
sesses to a substantial degree all of the qualifications enumerated
in the association's guidelines for evaluations of nominees to the
U.S. Supreme Court--exceptional legal ability, extensive experience
and knowledge of the law, outstanding intellectual and analytical
talents, maturity of judgment, unquestionable integrity and inde-
pendence, a temperament reflecting a willingness to search for a
fair resolution of each case before the Court, a sympathetic under-
standing of the Court's role under the Constitution in the protec-
tion of the personal rights of individuals, and an appreciation of
the historic role of the U.S. Supreme Court as the final arbiter of
the meaning of the United States Constitution, including a sen-
sitivity to the respective powers and reciprocal responsibility of the
Congress and the Executive.

  The association's guidelines do not provide for gradations of rat-
ings, and thus only permit a rating of qualified or unqualified.
These guidelines do, however, establish a very high standard, a
standard which, in our opinion, Judge Ginsburg clearly meets.

  We look forward to a long and exceptional career on the Supreme
Court for Judge Ginsburg, and I am once again very grateful to you
and this committee for the opportunity to share those views with
you.

           PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN D, FEERICK

My name la John D. Feerick and I am President of the Association of the Bar of

the City of New York. Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify before the

Senate Judiciary Committee today regarding the nomination of Judge Ruth Bader

Olnsburg to the United States Supreme Court

The Association of the Bar of the City of New York la one of the oldest bar

associations In th# country, and since its founding in 1870 has given priority to the

evaluation of candidates for Judicial office. Our Committee on the Judiciary was one

of the four committees formed at the Association's inception. As far back as 1874, the

Association has reviewed and commented on the qualifications of candidates for the

United States Supreme Court. We have also studied the Senate Confirmation

process, and last year submitted to this Committee a report andrecommendations

with regard to the process, it is thus a particular honor to participate in the

oonfirtnatton proceaa for this highly distinguished nominee, who is also a member of

our Association and served on our Executive Committee from 1974 to 1078.

In May 1987, the Association adopted a policy that directs the Executive

Committee, our governing body, to evaluate all candidates for appointment to the

United States Supreme Court The Executive Committee has developed an extensive

procedure for evaluating Supreme Court nominees, including a process for conducting

research, seeking views of persons with knowledge of the candidate and of our

membership, and evaluating the information received. The Committee than applies

what it learns about a candidate to a rigorous set of guidelines comprising

qualifications we bafeve are essential in a Supreme Court Justice. Indeed, Judge

Olnsburg Is the'first flomlnea to be evaluated under this set of guidelines. The

Association's effort: wes largely undertaken by the work of a Joint subcommittee of our

Executive Committee and our Committee on the Judiciary.

In examining the qualifications of Judge Glneburg, the following materials were

reviewed:  i

- all of Judge Qlnsburg's more than 300 written opinions, concurrences and
  dissents while sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit:
                                       560

          forum held at the Association; and

       * news artleles, oommentaries and other materials with regard to the

        Members of the Executive Committee also interviewed Judge Qinsburg. In

addition, dozens of Interviews were conducted with her Judicial colleagues, academic

          .....-

ooleagues and former law darks, and lawyers who litigated with and against or

argued before Judge Qinsburg.

       The Executive Committee, upon evaluating the qualifications of Judge

Oinsburg, passed the following resolution at its meeting of July 14,1903:

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we are very grateful that you would take
such time and with such thoroughness examine the record of nomi-
nees. One of the reasons why we do, in fact, ask your association
to be here is because of its over 100-year practice of being involved.

  I have often wanted to ask you, and I will reserve it now for
maybe over a cup of coffee, what you all did during the Tammany
Hall days. I would like to know more about that.

  Mr. FEERICK. I have to research that myself.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am serious. It would be a fascinating thing to
look at. I have often wondered whether or not the origins of the
practice of the bar of New York City of looking into judicial nomi-
nations was a response to the patronage system and concern about
it that existed in the days of the late 19th century. It has just been
an historical curiosity on my part. Maybe if the historian of the as-
sociation knows the answer to that, I would appreciate being
dropped a note for my own edification, no other reason.
  Mr. FEERICK. YOU are certainly correct in pointing to corruption
in New York as being a precipitating cause of the founding of our
bar association, which is exactly right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you for your testimony.
  Mr. FEERICK. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Mr. Wiesenfeld, it is a pleasure to have you
here. You have been immortalized by your being a participant, and
a named participant, in one of the most significant Supreme Court
cases of the last 20 years, and maybe longer, and it is a pleasure
to have you here. The floor is yours for 5 minutes.

               STATEMENT OF STEPHEN WIESENFELD
  Mr. WIESENFELD. Thank you, Chairman Biden. Senators, I would
like to thank you for inviting me here, and I would also like to
thank my very special friend, Jane DeFalco, sitting behind me, for
accompanying me here today.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome, Ms. DeFalco.
  Mr. WIESENFELD. My wife, Paula, and I were married in 1970.
Not unlike Martin Ginsburg and his wife, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
we were among the pioneers of alternative family lifestyles. Paula
was a high school math teacher at Edison High School in Edison,
NJ, and she was completing studies for her Ph.D. She wanted her
career in school administration.
  I, having already received several graduate degrees, and having
already seen big business, decided to be a self-employed consultant.
It was our plan that I would take on the primary household chores,
including those related to the raising of our son, Jason.
  In 1972, my wife, Paula, passed away. She worked right up to
the last day. With each paycheck, she made the maximum con-
tribution to the Social Security system. When she died, I ap-
proached the Social Security office in New Brunswick, NJ, and ap-
plied for the insured benefits for myself and our son, Jason. I was
denied widow's benefits.
  At that time, the law allowed that both men and women alike
would contribute to the Social Security insurance system based
upon their earnings. If the male died, his Social Security insurance
would then accrue to pay benefits to the family he left behind. If
the woman died, even though her contribution was equal to that
                                                   562

of the male, no such insurance benefit would accrue to her surviv-
ing spouse.

  The contributions that my wife, Paula, had made to be insured
under the Social Security system essentially got lost in the system.
Women not only earned less money than men for the same work,
they were also forced to contribute to a Social Security system that
did not insure them with equal protection.

  Some months later after reading a story in the New Brunswick
Home News about widowed men, I wrote a letter to the editor de-
tailing this inequity. I was then contacted by Phyllis Boring, a pro-
fessor at Rutgers University, who inquired if I would like to pursue
this matter legally. She then introduced me to Ruth Bader Gins-
burg.

  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a clear-thinking person endowed with in-
sight and forethought, a person already painfully aware of gender-
based discrimination, saw immediately the gains, the consequences,
and the long-range effects and the logistics of revising this inequity
in the Social Security system. Ruth Bader Ginsburg proceeded to
file suit against Casper Weinberger, then Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare.

  First, in a three-judge Federal district court in Trenton, NJ, then
Columbia law professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg forcefully argued her
position on gender-based discrimination in the Social Security sys-
tem. Using clear, concise arguments, she won a unanimous 3-0 de-
cision allowing that the Social Security laws were in violation of
the equal protection clauses of the 5th and 14th amendments.

  Casper Weinberger and the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In
January 1975, Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared before the U.S. Su-
preme Court expecting a mere minimum decision affirming the
three-judge Federal district court's decision.

  In Weinbergerv. Wiesenfeld, Ruth Bader Ginsburg again pro-
duced compelling arguments that gender-based discrimination as
part of the Social Security laws was a clear violation of the equal
protections clauses of the 5th and 14th amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States of America. On March 19, 1975, the
Supreme Court astounded everyone by handing down a unanimous
decision upholding the decision of the three-judge Federal district
court, proving that the visions of Ruth Bader Ginsburg were clearly
correct.

  Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld was a landmark decision in the quest
for equal rights for men and women. It remains still the strongest
stand the Supreme Court has ever taken to strike down gender-
based discrimination. This is one of the many accomplishments of
Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I am proud to appear before this es-
teemed committee today and to add my voice to the many who
stand with and wish to see this committee confirm Judge Ruth
Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Thank you.

   This is one of the many accomplishments of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I am
proud to appear before this esteemed committee today and to add my voice to the
many who stand with, and wish to see, this committee confirm Judge Ruth Bader
Ginsburg to the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank you very much for your testimony.
A little known fact--as we say, a point of personal privilege--is
that I shared a similar fate that you did in 1972 and raised two
children with a professional wife who had passed away, and it is
amazing how much has changed.

  I thank you all for taking the time and the effort, and I must
say again that I have been impressed with how concise and
thoughtful and how full in their support and opposition to Judge
Ruth Bader Ginsburg the panels have been. Each of the six panels
has served their position well, and each has served us by being
here. I thank you very, very much.

  Mr. Ortiz, I don't think we are going to have to wait much
longer. At least, that is my hope and my expectation.

  Senator do you have any comments?
  Senator HATCH. Well, we are happy to have all of you here, and
I have to say that, Mr. Ortiz, it was very close this time.
  Mr. ORTIZ. Very close.
  Senator HATCH. And I want to tell you that there are very few
opportunities to fill these positions, and I want to commend the
President for making an excellent choice here. We really appreciate
the testimony of each of you, as we have all of the witnesses, in-
cluding those who have testified in opposition. Everybody has been
respectful and, I think, very considerate in their testimony, and
you, in particular, have been.
  Mr. Wiesenfeld, I have to tell you that your name, of course, goes
down in history and has gone down in history as a very, very im-
portant name in the field of civil rights and human rights, and we
appreciate you being here and taking the time to come after all
these years.
  Mr. WIESENFELD. A pleasure; I really enjoyed myself.
  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Speaking of being gracious and concise, running
the risk that it could hurt him politically, I want to thank my
friend from Utah. He has been, as the saying goes in this cir-
cumstance, a gentleman and a scholar. He has been extremely
thoughtful and considerate, and the way in which my Republican
colleagues have approached this nomination, I think, is a standard
that I hope everyone will remember if and when the perilous day
comes that a Republican is once again naming Supreme Court
nominees.
  I thank you, Senator, for the way in which you have not only co-
operated, but the way in which you have led this committee.
  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.

                                    CLOSING STATEMENT

  The CHAIRMAN. There is nothing more, God willing, to come be-
fore this committee and this hearing, and I know the press will ask
this question, so I will state it at the outset. It is my hope and ex-
pectation that next Thursday, which is in the normal course of pro-
ceeding within this committee, we will have before us in an execu-
tive session, which merely means with no business before us in
terms of witnesses, but considering the nominations of individ-
uals--it is my hope, with the permission of my Republican friends,
to convene in executive session at 10:30 on Thursday morning next
in order to consider the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the
Supreme Court, and for this committee to fulfill its internal Senate
responsibilities of making a recommendation to the Senate as a
whole as to whether or not she should be confirmed.

  I want to end where I began. This committee and this hearing
is and should only be one part of the process of examining whether
or not someone should sit on the Supreme Court of the United
States. Our job is to, as thoroughly as we can, look into the back-
ground and qualifications of a nominee, and then make a rec-
ommendation to the Senate as a whole.
                                      565
  The Constitution does not mention the Judiciary Committee; it
mentions the U.S. Senate. We are operating at the request and at
the will of the Senate as a whole, and next Thursday hopefully we
will be able to make that recommendation to the U.S. Senate for
the Senate's debate and consideration.
  I thank you all. I thank everyone for their cooperation, all of my
colleagues, and this hearing is adjourned.
  [Whereupon, at 2:43 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

                     WRITTEN QUESTIONS FOR RUTH BADER GINSBURG
                                   FROM JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
                                              July 27, 1993

1. At the hearings, you discussed the Chevron doctrine of

statutory interpretation. See Chevron USA v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837

(1984). Following the Supreme Court's decision, some courts have

applied the "Chevron rule" to require deference to the agency's

reasonable policy view unless Congress has resolved the precise

matter at issue in a contrary way. Ready deference to the

administrative agency whenever a statute is ambiguous or silent

on a specific point stands in tension with a court's duty to

reason from broad congressional statements of purpose to the

particular issue before the court.

        How should Chevron be applied in light of this tension?

        What are the limits on this doctrine, and what sort of

         factors would you take into account in determining the

        proper deference owed to agency interpretation?

2. In your written response to the Committee's questionnaire,

you stated that:

         It is inappropriate, in my judgment, to seek from any
        nominee for judicial office assurance on how that
         individual would rule in a future case. That judgment
        was shared by those involved in the process of
         selecting me. No such person discussed with me any
         specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that
         could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express
         or implied assurances concerning my position on such
         case, issue, or question.

         During the six months prior to the announcement of my
         nomination, I had no communication with any member of
         the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the
         Senate or its staff referring or relating to my views
         on any case, issue or subject that could come before
         the United States Supreme Court.

       For the record, was any attempt made by anyone associated
       with the Administration to obtain a commitment concerning,
       or to determine, how you would decide any issue or case?

          Responses by Ruth Bader Glnsburg to Written Questions
         by Senator Joseph H. Biden, Jr., received July 27, 1993

           1. Tne doctrine of deference to agency constructions of
statutes applies when "Congress, through express delegation or
the introduction of an interpretive gap in the statutory
structure, has delegated policy-making authority to an
administrative agency." Pauley v. Betbenergy Mines, Inc., Ill S.
Ct. 2524, 2534 (1991). The first step in decs id ing whether
deference is due, therefore/ is to determine if the statute
itself answers the question, leaving no gap for the agency to
fill. This step requires the courts to "employ[] traditional
tools of statutory construction.11 Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1964)* The courts must examine "the
language and structure of the Act as a whole" (Dole v. United
Steelworkers of America, 494 U.S. 26, 41 (1990)) and any other
pertinent evidence of the statute's proper meaning, including its
legislative history (id. at 41-42) and "its object and policy"
 (id. at 35 (internal quotation narks omitted)).

           In short, the task of statutory construction for the courts
is neither mechanical nor narrow. Statutory language that might
seen ambiguous in isolation, presenting a "gap" for the agency to
fill, can take on a clear meaning in the light of full judicial
consideration of congressional intent. Only if the reviewing
court concludes that more than one answer is consistent with the
congressional will expressed in the statute, having fully
considered the relevant materials, is the agency charged with
administering the statute owed deference.

          Even then, deference is limited, because the reviewing
court must determine whether the particular construction advanced
by the agency is a "reasonable interpretation." chevron, 467
U.S. at 844. Lack of a single congressionally determined meaning
does not give the agency license to adopt any view it pleases.
The agency view must itself be consistent with statutory language
and congressional policy. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-45; Pauloy,
111 S. Ct. 2534-35. Beyond that, the agency position must --
whether treated as a matter of statutory interpretation or as a
matter of administrative policymaking subjeat to normal APA-
review standards -- be internally reasonable. It must reflect
reasoned deoiaioninaking, judged in light of such factors as the
thoroughness of the agency's consideration of evidence and
policies, the need for expertise on the question, and the
consistency of the agency position with earlier views or the
presence of articulated reasons for changing such views. Id. in
this raapoat as in the initial task of statutory construction,
the judicial role is anything but Mechanical.

          In the end, the courts' task is to ensure rational
administration consistent with governing law, giving full weight
to authoritative guidance from Congress. The "tensions1* you
describe are always present in determining where congressional
constraint leaves off and agency discretion begins. The process
demands sometimes-difficult judgment calls about when congress
has spoken with sufficient clarity. Greater legislative clarity,
of course, reduces the difficulty of these judgments.

          2. This is to confirm the response I gave to the
Committee's questionnaire: Ho attempt was made by anyone
associated with the Administration to obtain a commitment
Concerning, or to determine, how I would decide any issue or
case.

                   WRITTEN QUESTIONS FOR RUTH BADER GINSBURG
                                 FROM SENATOR STROM THURMOND

       I want to ask you a few questions about the 10th Amendment
to the United States Constitution.

       As we all know, and as discussed here, the Constitution was
submitted to the states by resolution of the Constitutional
Convention on September 17, 1787. South Carolina was the eighth
state to ratify on May 23, 1788.

       The Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the
Constitution, was proposed by Congress on September 25, 1789,
and declared ratified on December 15, 1791.

       After the Constitution was submitted and before it was
ratified, assurances were made to Legislatures of the several
states that the 10th Amendment as part of the Bill of Rights
would become a part of the United States Constitution. These
assurances assured the ratification of the Constitution.

       What is your view of two levels of sovereignty guaranteed by
the Constitution--State sovereignty and federal sovereignty?

       What is you view of the separation of powers doctrine as
enunciated by the founding fathers and guaranteed by the 10th
Amendment?

       What weight will you give to the 10th Amendment when
considering laws enacted by Congress that pre-empt state
authority and sovereignty?

       In your judgment, does the 10th Amendment have meaning and
worth today and in the future?

Dear Senator Thurmond:

        Your questions about the Tenth Amendment were forwarded to
me yesterday. I enclose a response, which I hops you will find
satisfactory.

        With appreciation for your interest.

                                                   Sincerely,

           Response by Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Written Questions
             of Senator Strom Thurmond, received July 26, 1993

        In response to the four questions you asked about the Tenth
Amendment, I have several overlapping thoughts and therefore hope
you will find this composite answer satisfactory. The plan for
dual sovereignty, confirmed in, and reinforced by the (Tenth
Amendment, is a core part of our Nation's history and an important
reason for our Nation's success. Justice Black, in Younger v.
Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), spoke eloquently on this subject when
he referred to the essential character of "Our Federalism." Many
other Justices have expressed similar views over the yaarc. "Our
Federalism11 has inspired foreign systems, notably, the European
Economic Community members, and the motivating spirit of the Tenth
Amendment should continue to contribute to the greatness of the
United States.

        As you nota, the Tenth Amendment is vital to the
Constitution's separation of powers scheme. The separation for
which the Founders provided is indicated both by the tripartite
structure established in the first three Articles of the
Constitution, and by the Tenth Amendment. Further recognition of
the sovereignty of the states is contained in the Guarantee Clause
of Article IV, section 4.

        Today, as in earlier years, the Tenth Amendment serves as a
basic reminder -- first to Congress and then to the courts in
interpreting congressional actions ~ that the national government
is one of limited powers and that the sovereignty of the states is
a cornerstone in our constitutional structure. In specific
application, the Amendment requires congress to be clear and
careful when it considers displacement of state authority with
federal programs; and it requires the courts to insist on such
clarity in cases involving claims that congress has pre-empted
state legislative, regulatory, or judicial authority.

                                   FROM SENATOR HERB KOHL

1. My home state of Wisconsin has taken a lead in allowing
televised court proceedings. So I was especially pleased with your
support for allowing cameras in the courts when you discussed
this matter with Judge Heflin yesterday and with Senator Hatch
today. But I'm not sure precisely where you stand with respect to
televising Supreme Court oral arguments.

       Almost two years ago, Justice Thomas told this Committee
that "it would be good for the American public to see what's going
on there" - meaning the Supreme Court.

        QUESTIONS: Do you agree with Justice Thomas? Do you
        personally support televising Supreme Court oral arguments?

            Response by Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Written Quastion
                  of Senator Herbert Kohl, dated July 22, 1993

        As I suggested at the Hearings, televised appellate
proceedings can convey at once a picture not easily drawn in
words spoken outside the courtroom, one can also view televised
proceedings as an extension of the U.S. tradition of open
proceedings.

        I am sensitive, however, to concerns about distortion, and
consider essential court control of any editing. Furthermore, I
appreciate the need for good will among colleagues, and would not
push xy own preference without first hearing the views of others
on this subject.

        Just now an experiment with televised proceedings is ongoing
in the federal courts, with several district courts and courts of
appeals as participants. A report based on experience will be
made to the U.S. Judicial Conference and the Conference may
thereafter adopt a resolution on cameras in courts. It would be
judicious to await the Conference report so that Supreme Court
practice oan be developed in light of the Conference discussion
and recommendations.

                               SMALL BUSINESS

I would like to ask a couple of questions relating to business
issues. While Ranking Member on the Small Business Committee, I
intend to devote considerable attention during this Congress to
improving the business climate for the small businesses of my state
and throughout the nation.

MINORITY SET-ASIDE PROGRAMS

In City of Richmond v. Croson. 488 U.S. 469 (1989), the Supreme
Court overturned a minority set-aside program that had been
implemented by the City of Richmond, Virginia. In doing so, the
Court outlined a two-part test that must be met if state and local
governments are to implement constitutional set-aside programs for
minority contractors.

As I understand the test, it requires that local public sector entities
must base remedial minority set-aside programs on their own past
discriminatory practices ~ not on more general societal wrongs that
precipitated past discrimination against minority groups, even if
ample historical evidence supports such a finding. Once a strong
factual predicate is established, state and local governments must
develop a set-aside program narrowly tailored to a specific goal.

You had occasion to apply the Croson standard in O'Donnell
Construction Company v. District of Columbia. 963 F.2d 420 (1992).
In that case, you wrote a concurrence in which you held with the
majority that the District of Columbia Minority Contracting Act
violated a local non-minority contractor's Fifth Amendment right to
equal protection. You agreed that under the Croson test, where
"race classification is resorted to for remedial purposes, measures
must be narrowly focused and supported by a strong factual
predicate". You also agreed that the District's Minority Contracting
Act "falls short on both counts."

However, you go on to state that you concur "with the
understanding, made clear by Croson. that minority preference
programs are not per se offensive to equal protection principles,
nor need they be confined solely to the redress of state-sponsored
discrimination."
                                      579

1) First, do you believe I have stated the holding in Croson
      correctly - that (1) a state or locality must demonstrate a
      compelling governmental interest by relying on prior
      discrimination by the state or local government itself; and (2) a
      resulting set-aside program must be narrowly tailored to
      accomplish a remedial purpose?

 2) Could you elaborate on what you meant in your O'Donnell
      concurrence when you state that it is your "understanding" that
      minority preference programs need not "be confined solely to
      the redress of state-sponsored discrimination."

 Over 75 percent of the states and more that 190 U.S. localities
 have implemented some form of set-aside programs for minority
 contractors. In many of these instances - such as in Richmond
 and the District of Columbia ~ these programs were developed
 using the guidance of Fullilove v. Klutznick. 448 U.S. 448 (1980).
 However, cases such as Croson and Wyqant v. Jackson Board of
 Education. 476 U.S. 267 (1986) hold that Fullilove does not provide
 an appropriate standard for state and local governments since it
 applied to actions of the U.S. Congress taken under its specific
 constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the Fourteenth
 Amendment.

3) Do Croson. Wygant and their progeny provide state and local
     governments with a standard clear enough that they can revise
     their Fullilove based minority set-aside programs in such a
     manner as to make them constitutional? My basis for this
     question once again is your statement in O'Donnell that these
     programs need not "be confined solely to the redress of state-
     sponsored discrimination" and your additional statement that
     "remedy for past wrong is not the exclusive basis upon which
     racial classification may be justified."

4) Do the caveats you expounded in Q'Donnell demonstrate your
     belief that communities and states can develop constitutional
     minority set-aside programs based on standards other than
     those established by Croson? If so, doesn't this leave the
     future of Croson somewhat unclear and the job of state and
     local officials trying to develop a constitutional program much
      more difficult?

EMPLOYER V. UNION RIGHTS

In Microimage Display Division of Xidex Corporation v. National
Labor Relations Board. 924 F.2d 245 (1991), you voted in the
majority in a case involving a series of actions taken by Xidex
Corporation following its purchase of a new plant that had been a
union shop. The union alleged many of these actions constituted
unfair labor practices. An administrative law judge and the NLRB
agreed with the union on several points and you enforced their
orders against Xidex.

1) In Xidex, the Circuit Court relied on the holding in NLRB v.
     Brown. 380 U.S. 278, 287-88 ((1965) that "antiunion motivation
     will convert an otherwise ordinary business act into an unfair
     labor practice." Please elaborate on what you understand this
     standard to mean.

2) The Circuit Court in Xidex also makes the point that in
     conducting its review of NLRB actions, it would extend
     deference to the Board's findings of fact. Indeed, the court's
     opinion cites 29 U.S.C. 160(e) and explains its decision is
     governed by the statutory language that "the findings of the
     Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by
     substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall
     be conclusive."

     a) Please explain your understanding of the phrase
          "substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole."

     b) Do you find the use of the word "substantial" particularly
          instructive in making a fact-based determination that the
          National Labor Relations Act has been violated?

3) At another point in the opinion, the Circuit Court notes that
     "although a showing of antiunion animus does not
     automatically establish a violation of [the Act], it places on the
     employer the burden to prove that it would have undertaken
     the action alleged to be an unfair labor practice even in the
     absence of the antiunion sentiment." The Court goes on to find
     that "[h]ere, the employer failed to carry its burden; the Board
     was therefore justified in finding a violation" of the Act.
                                         581

      a) What evidentiary standard must a union meet in order to
           demonstrate "antiunion animus" sufficient to shift the
           burden of proof to the company?

      b) What evidentiary standard is applied to employers once the
            burden of proof has shifted to them in these cases?

INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OFFICE EXPENSES

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court, in Commissioner v. Soliman.
113 S. Ct. 701 (1993), limited the availability of the home office
income tax deduction for many taxpayers. While I know you did
not have occasion to write an income tax opinion during your years
on the Circuit Court, as the ranking member of the Small Business
Committee, I would like to explore this issue. I am troubled by the
decision in Soliman and what it could mean for small business men
and women and other self-employed individuals.

As you may know, the issues in Soliman. revolved around an
anesthesiologist who practiced in three local hospitals-none of
which provided him an office. He used a room in his home for
administrative office functions such as records keeping and billing.
While the District and Circuit courts allowed his deduction of
expenses associated with his home office, the Supreme Court
reversed and created new factors to be considered in the
determination of whether home office expenses are deductible.

In essence, it seems to me the decision wrote two new conditions
into law-conditions that appear nowhere in the tax statutes written
by Congress. The Court held that in deciding whether to allow a
deduction for home office expenses, the IRS and the courts should
take into account: (1) the relative importance of the activities
performed at each business location; and (2) the time spent in
each place.

The reason I am troubled by the decision is that it creates new
standards based upon what the justices think Congress meant to
say. While such an exercise certainly is part of the statutory
interpretation responsibilities of the Court, it seems to me that in
this case, the Justices read the statute very expansivelv--and did so
                                          582

in favor of the IRS position at the expense of individual taxpayers'
interests.

1) What is your philosophy concerning the Court's role in
     statutory interpretation? In answering, I would like to hear your
     views with regard to tax cases, but anything you would wish to
     add in a general vein on the subject also would be appreciated.

2) If you are familiar with Soliman. I also would appreciate any
     comments you might have concerning the Court's reasoning
     and decision in that case.

           Responses by Ruth Bader Gtinsburg to Written Questions
         by Senator Larry Pressler on Employer v. Union Rights

                                      received July 26, 1993

         in Microimage Display Division of Xidex Corp. v. NLRB, 924
 F.2d 245 (D.C. Cir. 1991), a unanimous panel (Judges Henderson,
Hald and R.B. Ginsburg), in an opinion by Judge Henderson, agreed
to enforce an NLRB order in full in the face of oroas-petitions
 for review by the employer and the union. The opinion i& highly
 fact-specific and turns on the panel's statutorily-guided
deference to the Board's decision.

         The NLRB determined that the employer's threat to transfer
work from its union to its non-union facility (which would have
entailed laying off over twenty workers at the union plant)
contravened section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. That section declares
 it an unfair labor practice for an employer "to interfere with,
restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights
guaranteed under [the NLRA to engage in concerted activity for
purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or
protection]."

         Evidence in the record indicated that prior to the
threatened transfer, a company manager had declared his intent to
develop a strategy to rid the company of the union. Following
the threat, employees, with some employer encouragement,
circulated a union decertification petition. The record
indicated that after circulation of the decertification petition,
the company reversed its plan to move work away from the union
facility. Just over a month later, the employer terminated
recognition of the union, and actually transferred in work from
its other, non-union plant.

         Based on a full review of the record, the panel accepted the
Board's finding that the employer's threat was motivated by
antiunion animus. Given that adequately-supported finding, it
was incumbent on the employer to demonstrate that it would have
planned the work change even absent antiunion sentiment. Again,
the panel deferred to the NLRB's finding that the employer had
not made the necessary showing, i.e., had not carried the proof
burden oast on it. Accordingly, fcho court enforced the Board's
order regarding the 8(a)(l) violation.

         Your first question concerns my understanding of NLRB v.
Brown, 380 U.S. 278 (1965). In that case, the Supreme Court
indicated that the NXJSB need not inquire into employer motivation
to support an unfair labor practice finding where the employer's
conduct is inherently destructive of employees' rights and is not
justified as serving significantly a legitimate business end.
The Court's opinion in NLRB v, Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221
(1963), is illustrative. There, the employer offered twenty
years of superseniority to any striking worlcer who crossed the
picket line and returned to work. Blatant conduct of that order
is "inherently discriminatory or destructive," JSrie Realetor, 373
U.S. at 228, and obviates the need for independent evidence of
antiunion animus.

         But where the conduct is not so blatant and is designed on
its face to achieve legitimate business ends, then, according to
Brown, the Board can find antiunion motivation only when
independent evidence eo demonstrates. In the Xiclex case, as
Judge Henderson'B opinion explained, the Board pointed to
independent evidence sufficient to support a finding that
antiunion animus motivated the employer's threat to transfer work
                                  585

to its nonunion plant. In sum, after reviewing the record, we
were satisfied that the Board's unfair labor practice finding had
the requisite evidentiary support.

         Your second question concerns the standard courts use to
review decisions of the NLBB. The NLRA directs the court to
defer to NLRB findings of fact and sets out the standard for such
deference. Section 10(e) provides that, the "findings of the
Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by
 substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be
conclusive." The word "substantial" was added to section 10(e)
of the NLRA by the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. This standard for
review of agency fact-finding is consistent with the standard
generally applicable under the Administrative Procedure Act.

         in his opinion for the court in 195l in universal camera
Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474 (1951), Justice Frankfurter discussed
the meaning of the word "substantial." Quoting from earlier
 Supreme Court decisions, Justice Frankfurter noted that
 "substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means
 such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to
support a conclusion." In the Xidex case, the panel adhered to
the statutory instruction and the long-held precedent in this
area. The decision is consistent with the views I expressed in

the Hearings that a court considering an agency's decision should

respect that decision but not to the point of abdicating the

reviewing court's responsibility to canvass the record carefully.

         You next ask about evidentiary standards and antiunion
animus. I note first that the union bears no evidentiary
standard in these oases beoause the General Counsel of the NLRB,
not the union, presents the cases on behalf of workers. The
evidentiary standard NLRB's General Counsel must meet to show
"antiunion animus" was set out by Justice White in his opinion
for a unanimous Supreme Court in 1983 in NLRB v. Transportation
Maaagraaejit Corp., 462 U.S. 393 (1983). In that decision. Justice
White indicated that the General Counsel must persuade the Board
that antiunion animus has contributed to the employer's adverse
action. He noted that, consistent with the statutory requirement
in section 10(c) of the NLRA, the Board must rest its unfair
labor practice determination on a "preponderance of the
testimony."

        If the General Counsel has demonstrated antiunion animus
motivating the employer's action, the employer may show, as an
affirmative defense to the unfair labor charge, that the conduct
in question would have occurred in any event. Transportation
Maneigonent Corp,, 462 U.S. at 395. Applying this rule in the
Xidmx case, it was incumbent on the employer to show that the
plan to transfer work, and lay off employees, would have occurred
regardless of the divergent union status of each facility. As
Judge Henderson's opinion developed after carefully reviewing the
record, we deferred to the Board's reasonable determination that
the employer did not make the requisite showing.

           Responses by Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Written Questions
       by senator Larry Pressler on Minority Set-Aside Programs,

                                     received July 26, 1993

         You asked several related questions about the Supreme Court's
decision in City ot Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 D.8. 469
 (1989). Joining a unanimous panel and briefly concurring, I
applied the teachings of Croaon in O'Donnell Construction Co. v.
District of Columbia, 963 F.2d 420 (D.C. Cir. 1992). I hope you
will find in the following discussion adequate answers to your
inquiries *

         As you state, croson dealt with "remedial minority set-aside
programs11 for the award of government construction contracts --
i.e., with a local government's adoption of a program for the
purpose of remedying past discrimination. In that context, Croson
made clear, the past discrimination to be remedied need not be the
local government's own discrimination; it may be private
discrimination (by the construction industry) in which the
government had "become a 'passive participant'" through financial
support, 488 U.S. at 491-92, thus "exacerbating [the private
discrimination] pattern,w 488 U.S. at 504. That is what I meant in
O'Donnell when I wrote "minority preference programs" need not "be
confined solely to the redress of state-sponsored discrimination."
963 F.2d at 429.

         Croson also made clear that a looal government, in
establishing the basis for its remedial program, cannot rely on a
"generalized assertion" of nationwide discrimination in an industry
as a whole, 488 U.S. at 498, but "must identify [the]
discrimination, public or private, with some specificity." 488
U.S. at 504. Furthermore, the program must be "narrowly tailored
to remedy [the] prior discrimination." 488 U.S. at 507.

        With respect to its essential, practical meaning, Croson
explicitly stated: "Nothing we say today precludes a state or local
entity from taking action to rectify the effects of identified
discrimination within its jurisdiction." 488 U.S. at 509. The
Court thus contemplated that its "specificity" and "narrow
tailoring" standards were not impossibly restrictive, but could be
met by proper showings and proper programs. Hy concurrence in
O'Donnell cited an instance in which a court of appeals found, on
the particular facts, that the Croson standards likely would be
met. 963 F.2d at 429 (oiting Associated General Contractors v.
Coalition for Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1991), cert,
denied, 112 S. ct. 1670 (1992)).

        Finally, because Croson involved a city program designed as a
remedy for past discrimination, the holding of the case did not
address whether a race-based classification, in other contexts, can
be justified on a non-HremedialM ground. In O'Donnell, I commented
that "remedy for past wrong is not the exclusive basis upon which
racial classification may be justified." 963 F.2d at 429. x cited
as support for the comment Justice Stevens' concurrence in Croson.
Although Justiae Stevens ruled out any non-ramadial justification
for Richmond's race-based restriction on contractors' access to the
construction market, 488 U.S. at 512-13, he added that he would not
"totally discount the legitimacy of race-based decisions that may
produce tangible and fully justified future benefits" in, for
example, an education setting. 488 U.S. at 511 n.l, 512 fc n.2.
Justice Powell's opinion in University ot California Regents v.
Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 311-19 (1978), elaborated on such a non-
remedial justification in a school setting* Future oases, as you
know, could well present questions about the kinds of "narrow
tailoring" or other requirements one might appropriately apply to
a justification of the kind Justice Powell described, and it would
not be appropriate for me to address -- without a record, briefs,
and arguments -- what those usee night ba.

           Responses lay Ruth Bader Ginsburg to written Questions
         by Senator Larry Presslar on the Supreme court's Decision

              in commissioner v. aollatui, u s 8. ct. 701 (1993),
                                         received July 26, 1993

         Federal courts should interpret statutes, first and foremost,
by examining tbe statute's text. If the text i olear -- and as I
have said it is always the hope of federal judges that enactments
will clearly reveal what the legislature meant -- the text itself
Should resolve the matter. When the legislature's meaning is not
apparent from the statute's language, it is appropriate to take
into account traditional aides to interpretation, notably, the
overall statutory and historical contexts of the provision at
issue, including similar and prior statutes, and the legislative
history. While these additional materials should be relied on
cautiously, they sometimes prove helpful guides.

         In addition, applicable regulations authorised by the statute
should be accorded reasonable deference by courts. This is
particularly important in tax cases because the I R S has adopted a
comprehensive (often interrelated) set of regulations that Congress
and the country depend upon to foster evenhanded administration of
our complex tax laws.

         Regarding the sollman case in particular, it would not be
appropriate for me to comment on the Court's holding, especially
without the benefit of briefing and argument. 1 might note,
however, that the Court's endeavor in that case was to interpret
the provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.
S 280A(c)(l)(A), that allowed a deduction for a home office when
the office was used as "the principal place of business for any
trade or business of the taxpayer." All the Justices agreed that
the case turned on the meaning of this phrase.

                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                                (excerpted from section V, Conclusion)

        Judicial philosophy and judicial style are two very different facets of a judicial
nominee. Judicial philosophy encompasses a nominee's fundamental views about the role
of courts and the difference between law and politics, between judges and policymakers.
Judge Ginsburg has an activist judicial philosophy.

         * She believes that the Supreme Court can, and sometimes should, change its
           interpretation of the Constitution because of social changes.1

         * She believes that the Supreme Court can, and sometimes should, creatively
           interpret constitutional provisions in order to accommodate a modern vision of
           society.2

         * She believes in the need for "interventionist" judicial decisions when legislatures do
           not or will not act.3

         * She believes that "boldly dynamic interpretation" that departs "radically from the

         * She believes the Constitution can survive only if supported by judicial
           interpretations that are neither too "mushy" or too "rigid."5 She believes that a
           jurisprudence of original understanding is too rigid.6

         Judicial style is a combination of practical factors that describe the functioning, rather
than the role, of a judge. Judge Ginsburg has a moderate judicial style. It is only in this
sense that she can be called a "moderate," the label that so many are so quick to place on
her.

        * She opposes frequently writing separate opinions.7
        * She believes that judges should write no more than necessary to decide a particular

           case and should "take the low ground, and resist personal commentary" when
           writing for the court*
        Judge Ginsburg's views on abortion and Roe v. Wade are driven by her politics.
Consistent with her activist judicial philosophy, she believes the Supreme Court quite
properly involved itself in the abortion controversy, and should have done so by striking
down the restrictive law at issue in Roe on equal protection, rather than on due process,
grounds. This way, the Court could have encouraged a liberalizing political trend that, in
Judge Ginsburg's view, recognizes the independence of women in our society.
        Consistent with her moderate judicial style, Judge Ginsburg has criticized the
Supreme Court for going beyond invalidating the Texas law and announcing a set of
complicated rules that effectively struck down all other abortion restrictions-tough as well
as lenient-existing in 1973, and most of those enacted since.
        Judge Ginsburg's preferred equal protection theory, however, has serious conceptual
problems. Most important, men and women cannot be similarly situated with respect to
either pregnancy or its termination and, as such, it is impossible to discuss whether women
are being treated "equally" because of their gender. Since women are the sole focus of this
view, applying an equal protection theory to abortion rights necessarily means defining any
restriction on abortion-a course of action that only women can take-as impermissible sex
discrimination. As such, this theory would go beyond the policy established by Roe v. Wade.
Judge Ginsburg objects to the Supreme Court's decisions that the state is not constitutionally
required to pay for abortions, even though the Court applied her preferred equal protection
theory in those cases.

         On June 14,1993, President Bill Clinton exercised his power under Article IL Section
2 of the United States Constitution2 and nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ruth Bader
Ginsburg to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This analysis is provided
by the Judicial Selection Monitoring Project3 to assist the U.S. Senate in fulfilling its
constitutional role of 'advice and consent" and in considering Judge Ginsburg's nomination.

         Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born on March 15, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. She
received a B.A. with high honors in government and distinction in all subjects from Cornell
University in 1954, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. She attended Harvard Law School from
1956 to 1958, serving on the Harvard Law Review, and received her LL.B. and J.D. degrees
in 1959 from Columbia Law School, where she served on the Columbia Law Review and was
named a Kent Scholar. After serving as a law clerk to U.S. District Judge Edmund
Palmieri, she joined the faculty at Rutgers University School of Law and, from 1972 to 1980,
was a professor of law at Columbia. During her tenure there, she served as general counsel
to the American Civil Liberties Union and founded its Women's Rights Project. As counsel
to the Women's Rights Project, she successfully litigated several landmark sex discrimination
cases in the Supreme Court. She was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit by President Jimmy Carter on June 18, 1980.

         Judge Ginsburg is the author of numerous law journal articles and has continued
writing articles and delivering speeches since joining the federal judiciary. She has received
honorary academic degrees from nearly one dozen universities, as well as awards including

                                            I. INTRODUCTION

                                         A. The Rush to Judgment

         President Clinton withdrew his nomination of University of Pennsylvania law
professor Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights after admitting he
had read none of her writings. Attorney General Janet Reno lauded Guinier as a "superb"
nominee without having read any of her writings. This embarrassing experience should have
made plain the need for thoroughly examining a nominee's record before making judgments
or attaching labels such as "superb" or "moderate."

         Several additional factors point to the same conclusion, whether or not taking the
time required impacts on a convenient legislative schedule. First, Judge Ginsburg's 30-year
"paper trail," which includes hundreds of judicial opinions and dozens of legal briefs and
scholarly articles, is far longer than any Supreme Court nominee in recent memory.

          Second, even after thinking about it for more than 12 weeks, President Clinton
nominated someone he met for the first time just 24 hours before. Especially after the
Guinier episode, this unusual set of events puts a greater premium on post-nomination
evaluation.

        Third, the initial and critical evaluation, screening, and "vetting" of candidates was
conducted by a team of anonymous private lawyers.4 Their identities, hidden agendas,
conflicts of interest, and personal stakes remain completely unknown to the public. This
administration has a habit of allowing such anonymous and unaccountable people to make
significant personnel and policy decisions. For which judicial positions will this team of
lawyers screen candidates? Do any of these lawyers practice before the Supreme Court or
any other court for which they will recommend nominees? Who are these lawyers and what
are their credentials for serving this critical gate-keeping and screening function? Many
people concerned about the integrity of the Clinton administration have raised new doubts
based on this mysterious group having such enormous influence.3

         Fourth, Republican Senate leaders apparently have agreed to a July 20 bearing date,
just five weeks after the nomination was announced. This "unusual expedited process"6 will
take less than the minimum of six weeks that Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden
(D-DE) once said would be necessary, much less than the average over the last 13 years of
nine weeks between nomination and hearing, and less than half the time President Clinton
took to think about his choice. There is talk that an expedited process is being granted in
return for President Clinton's choice of a less-than-radical nominee, meaning that the
timetable is being dictated by who was not chosen rather than by who was. Focusing instead
on this nominee and the length of her paper trail counsels for more time.

                                           B. What's in a

         Analysts, reporters, and politicians rushed to label Judge Ginsburg within minutes of
her nomination. President Clinton, who had met her for the first time just a day earlier,
said when he announced her nomination that she "cannot be called a liberal or a
conservative."7 One reporter called her "a self-described centrist" and a "cautious" judge.8
The Wall Street Journal,9 Washington Post,10 and Washington Times11 all immediately
labeled her a "moderate," while the New York Times labeled her "moderate to liberal.""
One columnist said she "represents an extreme of moderation."13 Senator Charles Grassley
(R-IA) called her "a Democrat nominee that even conservatives can like and respect."14

         In 1991, one commentator offered a list of what he called "first-rate centrists" which
included Judge Ginsburg. His evaluation of Judge Ginsburg is as follows:

                  [Judge Ginsburg is] the least liberal of four Carter appointees
                  to U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C GrcuiL..stellar record as law
                  professor, pioneering and prolific scholar on women's rights and
                  civil procedure...was general counsel of the American Civil
                  liberties Union and its Women's Rights Project..was leading
                  litigator for women's rights...pro-choice on abortion but with
                  nuanced views on the constitutional issue posed by Roe v.
                  Wade...* political liberal who would be anathema to far-right
                  screamers but is widely respected by conservative and liberal
                  experts and litigators alike as a highly intelligent, careful judge
                  not given to crusading activism.13

         Advocates of judicial restraint-something quite different from conservative activism,
albeit a distinction lost to many liberal interest groups and members of the media
establishment-resist evaluating judges or judicial nominees on the basis of winners and
losers. Merely observing, for example, how often a judge has ruled for the prosecution in
criminal cases or for plaintiffs in civil rights cases says absolutely nothing about that judge
or about his or her judicial philosophy. Nevertheless, the media inevitably tabulates winners
and losers and publishes articles about whether a judge is "pro" this interest or "and" that
one, rules for this or that group how often, or sides with "conservatives" or "liberals" on a
particular court. By itself, without providing anything more meaningful to give such
statistical observations context, this is a fundamentally misleading approach to evaluating
a judicial nominee such as Judge Ginsburg.

         For example, Judge Ginsburg has joined in numerous rulings in favor of labor
unions.16 Yet one news report stated that "union lawyers have expressed concern about
two labor rulings in which Ginsburg voted against unions."17 One reporter thinks that

"Judge Ginsburg...would have dissented"1* in Roe v. Wade,19 the Supreme Court decision
creating the right to choose abortion, while analyst Bruce Fein writes that she would have
"concurred in the Roe result"20 These result-oriented assessments are rarely either
accurate or revealing of anything meaningful.

        Judges, unlike lawyers, do not advocate for clients. Judges, unlike politicians, do not
represent constituents. As such, it is troubling to hear President Clinton emphasize that
Judge Ginsburg "has repeatedly stood for the individual, the person less well-off, the
outsider in society" when discussing her particular fitness to serve on the Supreme Court21
Unless Judge Ginsburg is able successfully to put this advocacy role behind her, she will be
neither moderate nor centrist, but a judicial activist who ought not sit on the highest court
in the land. As a judge, she must stand for the law and its equal application to all,
regardless of race, gender, or social class.

                                 C. Marks of a Meaningful Evaluation

        Any meaningful evaluation of this nomination, then, must do two things. First, it
must fairly review and report on the substance of Judge Ginsburg's record. During the
1980s, opponents of Supreme Court nominees intentionally and seriously misrepresented the
substance of those nominees' records. Judge Ginsburg herself has, for example, criticized
a particularly "egregious" example of the Planned Parenthood Federation's attacks on Judge
Robert Bork, nominated to the Supreme Court in 1987.22 She condemned such attacks as
"emotionally charged, badly distorted, calculated to alarm."23

        This approach is an attempt to manipulate and commandeer, rather than assist and
inform, the judicial selection process. There can no doubt exist differences of opinion about,
and alternative conclusions drawn from, an accurately presented body of information. No
useful result can, however, flow from the land of distortion that often masqueraded as
"analysis" by liberal interest groups against Supreme Court nominees in the last decade.

         Second, a meaningful evaluation must put information about Judge Ginsburg's record
in some perspective for present purposes, that is, her nomination to the Supreme Court.
While her objective credentials form only part of the material needed to evaluate her
nomination, the remaining pieces of the puzzle must be chosen and explained with care.

         Judge Ginsburg has, after all, not been nominated to head an executive branch
department or regulatory agency. As such, her policy views-her political ideology-are not
important for their own sake. Neither has she been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court
of Appeals. As such, her views, for example, about adherence to the rulings of higher or
collateral courts may be less relevant. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been nominated to serve
on the Supreme Court of the United States, the very court that once served as a restraint
and supplied much of the applicable law for her on the U.S. Court of Appeals.

         In 1990, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including
Chairman Joseph R. Biden and Edward M. Kennedy, told then-Court of Appeals nominee
Clarence Thomas that while they might support him for his appellate position, they said, it
would be a very different ball game should he ever be nominated to the highest
court in the land. And indeed it was. Similarly, the Senate would shirk its duty simply if
it simply rubber-stamped Judge Ginsburg's nomination merely by observing that she has
spoken or acted with relative restraint while a U.S. Circuit Judge. The more important
inquiry is whether she is fundamentally committed to judicial restraint or exercised restraint
merely because she occupied the middle tier of the federal judiciary.

         A meaningful evaluation requires more than noting Judge Ginsburg's statement at
the press conference announcing her nomination that "ajudge is bound to decide each case
fairly in a court with the relevant facts and the applicable law even when the decision is not,
as [Chief Justice William Rehnquist] put it, what the home crowd wants."24 This may have
been the maxim she remembered while on the U.S. Court of Appeals; it begs the question
of what her maxim will be while on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the duty of the Senate,
in fulfilling its constitutional "advice and consent" function, to find out.

         A meaningful evaluation also requires more than the insistence by worshipful former
clerks that her opinions "are scrupulously free of ideology" or that she "has faithfully
reconciled personal conviction with a judge's duty to apply the law."25 On the Court of
Appeals, she may have had little choice. On the Supreme Court, she will have a choice.

         This report will examine Judge Ginsburg's scholarly record and will strive to organize
the pieces of that record into some coherent fashion. It will provide clues about Judge
Ginsburg'sjudicial philosophy and herjudicial style-two fundamentally different factors--and

determine whether she is, in fact, a "moderate." This report will also examine Judge
Ginsburg's views on abortion and Roe v. Wade. Finally, this report throughout will suggest
questions that Senators should ask as they seek to evaluate this nomination and fulfill their
constitutional role of advice and consent.

                                      II. JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

         During the 1980s, liberal interest groups and some Democratic Senators sought to
change the constitutional balance of power in the judicial selection process in order to
frustrate the appointment of judicially restrained judges to the federal courts. In doing so,
they sought to collapse "political ideology" into "judicial philosophy" and claim that nominees
were against all the relevant politically correct results. Using the attacks on Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork as an example, Judge Ginsburg observed that "[t]he distinction
between judicial philosophy and votes in particular cases, however, blurred."26

         This tactic, to be sure, made for useful sound-bites, direct-mail fundraising appeals,
and hysterical sloganeering. Judge Ginsburg described the tactic as "campaigns against
judges that spread misinformation, turn complex issues into slogans, and play on our
fears."27 As it perverted the judicial selection process and harmed good people, however,
this tactic also blurred the necessary distinction between law and politics and between the
judicial and political branches of government. It is no wonder that leaders of this attack on
judicial independence, such as Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice, already have said that
they want "a political justice" to fill the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.28

         "Judicial philosophy" encompasses an individual's views about the proper place of
courts in our system of co-equal branches of government, as well as the proper role of an
unelected judge. Should the courts involve themselves in social or political developments,
whether by prompting them or responding to them with changing interpretations of the
Constitution? Does the Constitution necessarily speak to every social problem or division
and is, therefore, a judge some mix of national physician, counselor, philosopher/king, and
handyperson? Must a judge necessarily do what other co-equal branches do not, or cannot?
Is it the judge's job to "do justice" in the abstract or to settle legal disputes?

         How should a judge approach the task of construing a statute or interpreting the
Constitution? This is a fundamentally different question from asking what an individual's
particular construction or interpretation might be. Confusing the two is precisely what

liberal interest groups and their Democratic Senate allies introduced into the mix during the
1980s. As liberals collapsed the judicial into the political, they treated judges like politicians
and judicial nominees like congressional candidates. They were only interested in how a
nominee would rule on issues they cared about Rather, a proper inquiry into a nominee's
judicial philosophy asks about the goal of interpretation and the tools that a judge should
employ in that task.

         The terms "activism" and "restraint" remain useful when properly defined. An activist
judge believes his or her job is generally to "do justice" in the abstract An activist believes
that the actual meaning of legal documents themselves (particularly statutes and the
Constitution) changes over time. An activist believes that judges and courts exist to heal
the divisions and address the problems of society. An activist believes that courts can, and
sometimes should, be involved in social change or prompt political developments and that
they should pinch-hit for legislatures that do not do the right thing.

         A restrained judge believes his or her job is to settle legal disputes properly brought
before the court. A restrained judge believes that the actual meaning of legal documents
does not change-that meaning remains what the document's framers (Congress, the
Founding Fathers, etc.) intended it to mean-but, instead, must be applied to changing
circumstances. A restrained judge has a more modest view of the judiciary's role, believing
that many other institutions (governmental and private) exist to handle divisions and
tensions in society and that they should be left alone to do their part when the courts have
done theirs. As a judicial colleague of Judge Ginsburg's once put it, "[judicial restraint' is
shorthand for the philosophy that courts ought not to invade the domain the Constitution
marks out for democratic rather than judicial governance."29

        Judge Ginsburg has provided some clues, including a particular formulation which
she has repeated over the years, about her judicial philosophy, at least while on a mid-level
appellate court. At the hearing on her nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals, she said:

                 And I believe that a judge is bound to decide fairly-based
                  solely on the relevant facts-the record made in the case the
                  and applicable law; a judge is bound to do that even then the
                  decision is, as Justice Rehnquist recently put it, not the one the
                  home crowd wants.30

                                         A. Nudging Social Trends

         One facet of a nominee's judicial philosophy is whether the courts should be involved
in social or political developments. Court cases, of course, result from such developments

and court decisions can contribute to them, and the view that judges should resist such
involvement in no way argues with this fact. But the important point here is whether a
judicial nominee is self-consciously committed to resisting this involvement, to deciding cases
on the basis of what the law requires rather than on the winds of political or social change.

         Judge Ginsburg has criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, which
created the right to choose abortion. The nature and implications of this criticism for her
judicial philosophy are explored in another section of this report, and it is enough here to
note that she has criticized the Court for stepping "boldly in front of the political
process."31 One reporter observed that Judge Ginsburg feels "the court should merely
nudge social trends."32

         Judge Ginsburg clearly approves of judicial involvement in social or political change;
she merely believes such involvement should be gradual rather than sudden. She did not
criticize the Court for "stepping in front of the political process" but for "stepping boldly."
Judge Ginsburg believes in "nudging" social trends rather than shoving them. This clearly
identifies her as a judicial activist.

         Judge Ginsburg is not fundamentally committed to judicial restraint, a principled and
self-conscious attitude that, all other things being equal, will guide her away from acting
politically rather than judicially. Her many statements cautioning against "venturing too far"
or shaping doctrinal limbs "too swiftly," to be sure, suggest that her activism has limits, but
she is nevertheless an activist. Judges acting politically have an activist judicial philosophy;
judges acting politically slowly or carefully may have a moderate judicial style. Only in this
latter sense can Judge Ginsburg be called a moderate. As Roger Pilon concludes: "Thus she
establishes herself as a 'judicial activist,' although one limited to 'interstitial' activism."33
Stuart Taylor, quoted above, concluded that she was not given to "crusading" activism.

         In one article, commenting on "the role the Supreme Court plays in the process of
social change,"34 Judge Ginsburg stated that, at least with respect to gender equality, "the

Court was neither in front of, nor did it hold back, social change."35 Rather, its
involvement was to foster "interplay among the people, the political branches, and the
courts."36 In this view, courts and judges are not the bulwarks of our liberties but the
facilitators of progressive social development Roger Pilon again puts it well when he says
that "the image is closer to 'good government' than to the separation of powers."37

         In one article, Judge Ginsburg dted comments by law professor Gerald Gunther,
spoken at her investiture as a judge, which she considers "a model" of "the good judge":

                  [The good judge] is genuinely open-minded and
                  detached,...heedful of limitations stemming from the judge's
                  own competence and, above all, from the pre-suppositions of
                 our constitutional scheme; th[at] judge...recognizes that a felt
                 need to act only interstitially does not mean relegation of judges
                 to a trivial or mechanical role, but rather affords the most
                 responsible room for creative, important judicial
                 contributions.38

The Judiciary Committee should explore Judge Ginsburg's views about these "creative,
important judicial contributions."

                                     B. Responding to Social Trends

        Elsewhere, Judge Ginsburg has written approvingly of changes in constitutional
interpretation brought about by "a growing comprehension by jurists of a pervasive change
in society at large."* She made this observation particularly to describe how the Supreme
Court came to apply the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause to women and
thereby to scrutinize sex-based legislative classifications. She described how the Court
turned "in a new direction" after understanding how legislation "apparently designed to
benefit or protect women could often, perversely, have the opposite effect."40 Elsewhere

she noted how "[p]ervasive social changes"undermined the reasoning in previous undesirable
Supreme Court decisions in the area of gender equality.41

                      C. Should Judges Implement Their Vision for Society?

         An important facet of a nominee's judicial philosophy is whether the courts are
empowered to implement their particular vision of what society needs. Judge Ginsburg's
writings suggest that she believes the courts should be such fully-engaged players. She has
argued that an equal rights amendment is necessary to provide an explicit constitutional
guarantee of equal protection for women. Nevertheless, she has written that the Fourteenth
Amendment's equal protection clause is "growth-susceptible"42 and elsewhere stated that
it is "phrased broadly enough" to cover women.43 In the absence of an equal rights
amendment, she writes, the Supreme Court "has creatively interpreted clauses of the
Constitution...to accommodate a modern vision of sexual equality....Such interpretation has
limits, but sensibly approached, it is consistent with the grand design of the Constitution-
makers to write a charter that would endure as the nation's fundamental instrument of
government."44 Anyone who believes that the Constitution can only endure if the Supreme
Court creatively interprets its clauses to accommodate modern social visions has a
fundamentally activist judicial philosophy.

                               D. Should Courts Fill In for Legislatures?

         Another facet of a nominee's judicial philosophy is whether courts should serve as
a societal pinch-hitter, filling in the gaps or stepping up to the plate when legislatures do not
or will not address particular issues or problems. In a 1981 article on judicial activism,
Judge Ginsburg discussed "legislative activism" in the aid of judicial restraint and stated that
"the need for interventionist [judicial] decisions...would be reduced significantly if elected
officials shouldered their full responsibility for activist decisionmaking."45 This is a

scholarly way of saying that someone has to do it and the judiciary will fill in if the
legislature fails. This is also a clear example of an activist judicial philosophy.

         Judge Ginsburg, to be sure, has expressed a preference for "activist decisionmaking"
by legislatures rather than by courts. This may suggest a moderate judicial style, but it is
an activist judicial philosophy nonetheless. In another article, she stressed that legislatures
ought to "install a system of legislative review and revision under which Congress would take
a second look at a law once a court opinion or two highlighted the measure's infirmities."46
Yet she dearly believes that courts should do the job if legislatures fail.

                                             E. Judicial Dialogue

                                  1. Between Judges on the same court

         Judge Ginsburg has discussed three different forms of dialogue in which judges
participate. The first, and narrowest, occurs among the judges on a single court. This
report, in its discussion of Judge Ginsburg's judicial style below, describes her emphasis on
writing narrowly and not separately. Nonetheless, she acknowledges that separate opinions
constitute a kind of dialogue among judges on a collegia! court that "may provoke
clarifications, refinements, modifications in the court's opinion."47

                                        2. Between different courts

         A second, and broader, dialogue occurs between judges at different levels in the
federal court system. Both separate opinions and opinions of the court participate in this
dialogue. "Separate opinions in intermediate appellate courts serve an alert function. If
appeal from the court's judgment is a matter of right, the separate opinion may assist the
court of next resort by charting alternative grounds of decision. If further review is
discretionary, as in the U.S. Supreme Court, a separate opinion may signal to the Court that
the case is troubling and perhaps worthy of a place on its calendar.

         In addition to separate opinions, the majority opinions of one court may participate
in a dialogue with superior courts. Judge Ginsburg voted against the full U.S. Court of
Appeals re-hearing a panel decision upholding the Navy's discharge of a sailor for engaging

in homosexual activity.49 She supported the narrower grounds for the panel's decision and
considered its broader constitutional discussion to be the individual viewpoint of Judge
Robert Bork, the opinion writer, rather than the views of the court.30 The judges arguing
for re-hearing criticized the panel opinion for ignoring judicial restraint and questioning the
coherence, if not the substance, of Supreme Court decisions. Judge Ginsburg responded:

                 The dissenting opinion bends judicial restraint' out of shape in
                 suggesting that it is improper for lower federal courts ever to
                 propose 'spring cleaning' in the Supreme Court In my view,
                 lower court judges are not obliged to cede to the law reviews
                 exclusive responsibility for indicating a need for, and proposing
                 the direction of, further enlightenment from Higher
                 Authority.'...It is a view on which I have several times acted.51

        In a panel discussion at Rutgers University School of Law the next year, she
nonetheless defended that panel's broader discussion of constitutional issues against strong
criticism by law professor Ronald Dworkin. She said: I f Judge Bork showed a lack of
judicial restraint or respect in questioning High Court precedent he regarded as doubtful,
then I suppose I did so also many times."52 She clearly sees the utility of a dialogue
between individual judges and courts occupying different tiers of the federal judiciary.

                            3. Between different branches of government

        Judge Ginsburg has suggested that she does not view courts as the solver of all
societal problems, but one of many players. She said during a 1985 roundtable discussion
at Rutgers University Law School:

                 But it is not sensible, for example, for civil rights advocates to
                 press today in federal court litigation for lowered standing
                 barriers, or broader views of state action, constitutionally-
                 guarded privacy, or the range of expressive conduct protected
                  by the first amendment. Instead, concentration should be on
                 state legislatures, administrative agendes-both federal and

                  state-and, most of all, public education, as election returns and
                  shifting student attitudes on many undergraduate campuses
                  indicate. The effort will require more patience, planning, and
                  persistence than campaigns aimed at sweeping victories in court,
                  but success, to the extent it is achieved, may be more secure.13

What is unclear is whether this reflects her understanding about the role of the courts
generally or a recommendation for proceeding "today," that is, during a time of domination
by Republican-appointed judges committed to judicial restraint

         Dialogue among judges on the same court or between judges on different tiers of the
federal judiciary is unobjectionable. Dialogue between the judicial and political branches
of government, however, can either be judicial activism-if the judges decide to do the
legislature's job-or judicial restraint-if the judges let the legislature do its own job. Judge
Ginsburg's writings place her in the activist camp.

         Judge Ginsburg is not opposed to judicial activism per se. Writing in the Georgia
Law Review, she stated that "the need for interventionist [judicial] decisions...would be
reduced significantly if elected officials shouldered their full responsibility for activist
decisionmaking."54 Judge Ginsburg does not oppose what she calls "interventionist" judicial
decisions. Rather, she apparently believes that it is preferable for legislatures to make such
decisions. She identifies "legislative activism" as an "aid of judicial restraint."55 The other
side of this coin, however, is the belief that judicial activism is appropriate in the face of
legislative restraint. Judges can, in her view, act where "Congress is too busy or too divided
politically to speak with precision."36 Thus she appears to roughly equate the judicial and
legislative branches as interchangeable players; someone has to do it, and the courts should
if the legislature does not. This is clearly the mark of a judicial activist.

                                 F. What Does "Interpretation" Mean?

         Judge Ginsburg has argued that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause
was not intended to cover women. She has stressed this view when arguing in favor of
adding an equal rights amendment to the Constitution. At the same time, however, Judge
Ginsburg has led a long-term litigation campaign to successfully urge the Supreme Court to

more strictly scrutinize legislative classifications based on sex, with the goal being
invalidation of such classifications under the equal protection clause.

         For purposes of politics, Judge Ginsburg argues that the Fourteenth Amendment
does not protect women. For purposes of litigation, she argues that it does. What are her
true views? Her apologists might argue that, as a lawyer, she must employ any legitimate
argument in the service of her client. Perhaps. This pattern nonetheless suggests that she
has often placed constitutional interpretation in the service of present political purposes.

         This pattern also suggests that she has little, if any, firm foundation in a coherent
constitutional or interpretive philosophy. This discussion has already noted the observations
by some that she is more a technician than an interpretive philosopher. Harvard law
professor Alan Dersbowitz says that she emphasizes the "fine print" rather than the "big
picture."57 Her selective references and manipulative use of originalism supports this view.

        Judge Ginsburg insists that respecting what she insists is the intent of the Fourteenth
Amendment's framers would constitute "a too strict 'jurisprudence of the framers' original
intent'."58 Rather, she writes approvingly of "[b]oldly dynamic interpretation, departing
radically from the original understanding...to tie to the fourteenth amendment's equal
protection clause a command that government treat men and women as individuals equal
in rights, responsibilities, and opportunities."59 She also writes that the Constitution can
"serve through changing times if supported by judicial interpretations that are neither
'mushy' nor too 'rigid'. And, as already noted, she approves of "creatively interpreted
clauses" as a way of making the Constitution accommodate modern social visions.

         The Senate Judiciary Committee should explore with Judge Ginsburg just what she
means by "interpretation" in these contexts. Only an activist could urge "boldly dynamic
interpretation," "creative interpreted clauses," and the "creative, important judicial
contributions" of which Professor Gunther spoke. She criticizes the Supreme Court for
"stepping boldly in front of the political process" in Roe v. Wade yet encourages the Court
to interpret boldly in sex discrimination cases. She wants the Court to interpret boldly,
dynamically, and creatively in that area, but insists that the Constitution will endure only if
the Court's interpretations are neither mushy nor rigid. These pieces do not suggest any
coherent judicial or interpretive philosophy.

         Judge Ginsburg has suggested that on a court like the U.S. Court of Appeals, and
"[u]nlike the Supreme Court, which faces few "grand constitutional questions," various
factors combine to "tug judges strongly toward the middle, toward moderation and away
from startlingly creative or excessively rigid positions."62Wil] she be free of the tug once
she joins the Supreme Court and begins facing grand constitutional questions or favor the
*[b]oldly dynamic interpretation"63 of the Constitution she has called for in the past?

                                          HI. JUDICIAL STYLE

         "Judicial style" is different from judicial philosophy. It includes commitment to
prudential rules of institutional restraint rather than broader, more substantive, views about
interpretation or the overall role of the courts. While judicial philosophy involves one's view
of the proper role of a judge, judicial style involves one's view of the proper functioning of
a judge. One can have an activist judicial philosophy but a moderate judicial style.

                             A. Compromise. Consensus, and Collegialitv

         When President Clinton nominated Judge Ginsburg, be outlined three reasons for
choosing her. One was that she would be "a force for consensus-building on the Court."
Judge Ginsburg is self-conscious about this role. She put it this way during a roundtable
discussion in 1985:

                 I don't see myself in the role of a great dissenter and I would
                 much rather carry another mind even if it entails certain
                 compromises. Of course there is a question of bedrock
                 principle where I won't compromise but I have a very low
                 dissent record on my court and I have learned a lot about other
                 minds paying attention to people's personalities in this job. I
                 take that into account much more than just the ideas that I was
                 dealing with in what I did before I came to the bench.64

                                     Writine No More Than Necessary

        Judge Ginsburg later, in her roundtable discussion at Rutgers University, said that
"a judge who speaks for a court with a wide range of views, rather than in a concurring or
dissenting opinion, should take the low ground, and resist personal commentary."0 This
was in direct reference to criticism of Judge Robert Bork's decision in Dronenberg v.
Zech,u in which the court upheld the Navy's policy of discharging sailors who engaged in
homosexual conduct

        Judge Ginsburg was not a member of the panel but did express her views when
addressing a motion for the entire court to review the panel decision. She voted not to re-
hear the case.67 She agreed with the panel's first conclusion, that the Supreme Court's
summary affirmance in Doe v. Commonwealth's Attorney* was binding but felt that in its
remaining discussion, "the panel opinion airs a good deal more than disposition of the
appeal required."69 She considered those "extended remarks on constitutional
interpretation as a commentarial exposition of the opinion writer's viewpoint, a personal
statement that does not carry or purport to carry the approbation of the court'."70 Her
clear preference, in her statement in Dronenberg as well as in her remarks at Rutgers
University a year later, is for the judge writing for the court to avoid addressing matters not
directly necessary to the case before the court.

voted to dismiss a sailor's challenge to his HUmUcal for homosexual conduct." Marcus, "Clinton's Unexpected

                             C. Writing Separately Only When Necessary

        Judge Ginsburg, as quoted above, has pointed out that she has "a very low dissent
record" on the U.S. Court of Appeals.71 Delivering the Jurisprudential Lecture at the
University of Washington School of Law in May 1989, Judge Ginsburg discussed "the
competing tugs of collegiality and individuality" and said that "[w]hen to acquiesce and when
to go it alone is a question our system allows each judge to resolve for herself."72 Clearly
opting for the former over the latter, Judge Ginsburg dted time constraints, the "danger of
crying wolf," and "[c]oncern for the well-being of the court on which one serves, for the
authority and respect its pronouncements command" as deterrents to writing separately.73

         While, as noted above, Judge Ginsburg sees some utility in writing separately, her
general view is that "[overindulgence in individualist judging...is counterproductive....Most
vitally, the 'rule of law* virtues are slighted when a court fails to function as a collegial body.
Those virtues are consistency, predictability, clarity, and stability."74

         There appears to be some agreement that Judge Ginsburg is, in the words of one
analyst, more "a legal technician" than "an interpretive philosopher."75 Another report
concluded that she has "a sometimes pedantic concern about details and procedure" and "her
opinions reveal no broad constitutional philosophy."76 Professor Dershowitz says more
critically that her opinions as a judge "have been characterized by a rigid proceduralism."77
One former clerk described her approach as "'restrained, taking small steps instead of big
steps-adhering closely to the precedents and not pushing the envelope. One reporter
concluded that Judge Ginsburg is one of those "cautious judges who are reluctant to
overturn precedent.

         Even as they rush to confirm Judge Ginsburg before their August legislative recess,
Senators should explore whether this attention to procedural and jurisdictional concerns is
part of Judge Ginsburg's fundamental commitment to a moderate-to-conservative judicial
style or whether it is merely a function of her serving on a mid-level appellate court That
is, once the restraint of Supreme Court precedent is removed, what principles will guide
Justice Ginsburg and are those the same that once guided Judge Ginsburg?

         This discussion of Judge Ginsburg's judicial style can conclude with two of her own
expressions. At the 1980 bearing on her nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals, she said:

                 And I believe that a judge is bound to decide fairly-based
                  solely on the relevant facts-tbe record made in the case and
                  the applicable law; a judge is bound to do that even when the
                  decision is, as Justice Rehnquist recently put it, not the one the
                 home crowd wants.80

Concluding an article on judicial activism, Judge Ginsburg wrote that the greatest members
of the federal judiciary "have been independent-thinking individuals with open but not empty
minds, individuals willing to listen and to learn. They have been skeptical of party lines and
they have exhibited a readiness to reexamine their own premises, liberal or conservative, as
thoroughly as those of others."81

         The Washington Post expressed its editorial view this way:

                  She herself has expressed a reference for 'measured motions' by
                  the judiciary, warning that 'doctrinal limbs too swiftly
                  shaped...may prove unstable.' She reaffirmed yesterday her
                  determination to view each case on the facts and the law
                  presented, no matter what her own personal views and the
                  urging of 'the home crowd' might suggest. To do anything less,
                  to go to the high court with a political agenda or a mind closed
                  to the unorthodox or the challenging, would be a betrayal of
                 judicial responsibility.82

        Judge Ginsburg has moderate practical instincts as a judge. She has a moderate
judicial style. She is an interstitial activist. Yet her activist judicial philosophy is of far
greater concern to those who seek to protect an independent judiciary. A philosophy of

judicial restraint can keep judicial style in check. Practical instincts, a moderate judicial
style, are no match for an activist judicial philosophy, especially when the shackles of
institutional constraint are removed by appointment to the highest court in the land.

                                 IV. ABORTION AND ROE v. WADE

         Judge Ginsburg founded the ACLLPs Women's Rights Project and served as the
ACLU's general counsel from 1974 to 1980. Anyone who thinks she does not support
constitutional protection for the right to choose abortion does not know what those four
letters represent. Noting her criticism of Roe v. Wade,** the Supreme Court's decision
creating the right to abortion, one analyst concluded that her objection did not extend to
"the ultimate goal of a right to abortion fully anchored in the Constitution and secure
against political undermining."84

         President Clinton, however, promised during the presidential campaign to choose
someone as his first Supreme Court appointee who is a "strong supporter of Roe [v. Wade]."
At least since the late 1970s, Judge Ginsburg has criticized the constitutional basis and
practical political impact of that decision. This slight departure from the politically correct
text immediately raised questions about whether Bill Clinton correctly applied his abortion
litmus test. Indeed, even he has backed off, insisting now only that Judge Ginsburg "is
clearly pro-choice" on abortion.85 Kathleen Quinn brands Judge Ginsburg's views
"alarming" and "stunning."86

                                    1. The Supreme Court's decision

        Judge Ginsburg has devoted nearly all of her professional life to crafting and
implementing a unified approach to issues of concern to women based on the Constitution's
requirement of "equal protection of the laws." During the 1970s, she argued and won

landmark cases in the Supreme Court requiring courts to constitutionally scrutinize laws that
treat men and women differently. The nature of her criticism of Roe's constitutional
foundation, then, may not seem surprising.

        On January 22,1973, by a 7-2 vote, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in
Roe v. Wade striking down a century-old Texas statute that prohibited all abortions except
those necessary to save the life of the mother. The Court decided, for the first time, that
the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause*7 protects a woman's decision whether
to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. The Court went past striking down that law-the
most restrictive in the nation-and crafted a scheme of rules for balancing the woman's right
and the state's interests in maternal health and fetal life during different stages of
pregnancy.

                                         2. Judge Ginsburg's views

        Judge Ginsburg has criticized the decision for basing the right to choose abortion on
the due process clause rather than the equal protection clause.88 For example, while still
a law professor, she wrote in a review of the Supreme Court's 1976-77 Term:

                  Significantly, the opinions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton
                 barely mention "women's rights." They are not tied to any
                  equal protection or equal rights theory. Rather, the Court
                  anchored stringent review of abortion prohibitions to concepts
                  of bodily integrity, personalprivacy or autonomy, derived from
                  the due process guarantee.

         When Professor Ginsburg became Judge Ginsburg, she continued raising the same
question. Delivering the Joyner Lecture on Constitutional Law at the University of North

              The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause reads: "nor shall any State deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

               The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause reads: '[nor shall any State...] deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." While the Fifth Amendment, which applies to
the federal government, does not contain a similar clause, the Supreme Court has decided that its due process
clause has an equal protection component and has thereby imposed the same restrictions on the federal
government that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on state governments. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420
U.S. 636,638 n.2 (1975); Bolting v. Shape, 347 VS. 497 (1954). Ruth Bader Ginsburg successfully Weinberger

Carolina School of Law in April 1984, she observed: T h e High Court has analyzed
classification by gender under an equal protection/sex discrimination rubric; it has treated
reproductive autonomy under a substantive due process/personal autonomy headline not
expressly linked to discrimination against women."90

         Judge Ginsburg repeated the same observation in a 1992 article: "But the Supreme
Court did not rest its Roe v. Wade decision on an equal stature for women or sex
discrimination rationale. Instead, the Court ruled on a personal privacy or autonomy
analysis that had few precedents."91

         Unfortunately, Judge Ginsburg has never described just how, based on the equal
protection clause, an opinion striking down the restrictive Texas statute might have been
written. In fact, she has never explicitly stated that Roe v. Wade was itself wrongly decided
or that it should be overruled. She has simply observed that the Court based its opinion on
the due process clause rather than on the equal protection clause. Most of her writings on
this subject are descriptive rather than analytical.

                                                   3. Analysis

         Judge Ginsburg is not alone in asserting that laws prohibiting or restricting abortion
constitute sex discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause. In Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services?1 for example, the parties challenging abortion restrictions
asked that, should the Court abandon Roe's due process theory for abortion rights, the Court
"remand th[e] case for consideration of what other Constitutional principles can support the
right recognized in Roe." They offered an equal protection theory as an alternative.

         Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has observed that "[t]he plaintiffs in Roe v.
Wade and Doe v. Bolton did not challenge the abortion restrictions as a form of sex
discrimination....The national ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project has long pursued a
policy of discouraging sex discrimination claims in abortion cases. This may be the result
of fundamental conceptual problems with the theory itself.

        Judge Ginsburg refers to an "equal protection or equal rights theory"94 or an "equal
protection/sex discrimination rubric as a better way of approaching cases challenging
abortion restrictions. The equal protection clause ensures that similarly situated individuals
are treated similarly.96 Applying this concept to the question of abortion rights creates
some difficulty. If women and men could both become pregnant, a law prohibiting only
women from obtaining abortions would violated the equal protection clause. This law would
treat women differently because of their sex.

        Men, of course, cannot become pregnant and, therefore, women and men cannot be
similarly situated with respect to either pregnancy or its termination. Denying to women
a course of action that only they can take-in this case, a particular method of pregnancy
termination-cannot be said to discriminate against them because of their gender; all persons
able to take that course of action are of the same gender.

         Perhaps the best way to make this point is to use examples from the very sex
discrimination cases that Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in litigating on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. Each of these cases involved
women being treated differently than similarly situated men because of their gender.

          Reed v. Reed" challenged an Idaho law requiring that men be preferred over
           equally qualified women to be estate administrators.

          Frontiero v. RichardsonTM challenged two statutes providing military servicemen
           with automatic dependency benefits for housing or medical care for their spouses
           but providing such benefits for military servicewomen only if her spouse depended
           on her for more than half his support.

          Weinberger v. Wiesenfe1dm and Califano v. Coldfarbm challenged Social
            Security benefits available to women but not to men.

         * Craig v. Boren102 challenged an Oklahoma law setting the age for purchasing beer
            at 18 for women and 21 for men.

         One of her former clerks summarized Judge Ginsburg's views on this point: "The
disadvantageous treatment of a woman because of pregnancy or reproductive choice, Judge
Ginsburg has written, is a paradigm case of discrimination on the basis of sex."103 Roger
Pilon counters:

                 Disadvantageous treatment of a woman because of her
                 pregnancy is treatment based, as the proposition states, on her
                 pregnancy, not her sex. Otherwise every woman would be so
                 treated, which not even Judge Ginsburg asserts. It is true, of
                 course, that only women become pregnant. But from that fact
                 it no more follows that pregnancy discrimination is sex
                 discrimination than that punishment for having committed a
                 crime is punishment for being a person-it being a fact also that
                 only people commit crimes.

         Exclusive focus on women, therefore, necessarily negates the equal protection
argument because individuals in the resulting class share the same gender. Yet an exclusive
focus on women is exactly what Judge Ginsburg advocates. Roe, she writes, would be less
subject to criticism "had the Court placed the woman alone...at the center of its
attention."105 Doing so, however, cannot be accomplished through the equal protection
clause since determining whether a woman has been treated "equally" with respect to her
gender requires reference to the treatment of similarly situated individuals of a different
gender, namely, men.

        Remember how her former clerk put it: "The disadvantageous treatment of a woman
because of her pregnancy or reproductive choicc.is a paradigm case of discrimination on

the basis of sex." Only women can become pregnant and, therefore, only women can obtain
abortions. Therefore, any abortion restriction is a "disadvantageous treatment of a woman
because of her pregnancy or reproductive choice" because no abortion restriction, no matter
how slight, can be applied against a man. To apply an equal protection theory to abortion
rights, then, requires arguing that any abortion restriction violates the equal protection
clause by definition.

        The Supreme Court has already rejected this idea. In Geduldig v. AieUo,106 the
Court upheld against an equal protection challenge a state program that excluded from
insurance coverage disabilities accompanying pregnancy. The Court held:

                 The California insurance program does not exclude anyone
                 from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes
                 one physical condition-pregnancy-from the list of compensable
                 disabilities. While it is true that only women can become
                 pregnant it does not follow that every legislative classification
                 concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification.107

Judge Ginsburg believes that "[t]he disadvantageous treatment of a woman because of
pregnancy...is a paradigm case of discrimination on the basis os sex." The Supreme Court
has rejected the notion that "every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-
based classification." No wonder the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project counsels
against making sex discrimination claims in abortion cases.

                                     1. The Supreme Court's decision

        During the 19th century, every state passed laws prohibiting all abortions except those
necessary to save the life of the mother.108 Between 1965 and 1972, every state considered

proposals to liberalize these statutes and many chose to do so.109 A study by the Planned
Parenthood Federation found that approximately half the states adopted proposals to reform
or repeal their abortion statutes.110

         In 1973, when the Supreme Court decided Roe, three types of statutes existed.
Thirty-one states retained the traditional restrictive statute."1 Another 15 states had
adopted statutes permitting abortions in specific circumstances.112 The final four states
allowed abortions for any reason but only during early pregnancy.113

         The Texas statute reviewed in Roe was of the first type and Roe obviously rendered
it unconstitutional. In a case decided the same day as Roe, the Court made clear that its
decision also rendered the second, more liberal, type of statute invalid.114 There is almost
universal agreement among scholars, analysts, and commentators that Roe effectively struck
down all existing abortion laws.115 None was liberal enough to survive the new scheme
of rules constructed by the Court in Roe. Its rigid framework has been applied since 1973
to invalidate nearly every abortion restriction including, for example, parental and spousal
consent,"6 standard of care in post-viability abortions,17 second physician requirement

        Judge Ginsburg clearly views this sudden and universal trumping of the legislative
process, and the wiping out of all existing abortion laws-restrictive and lenient-in a negative
light.

        On March 9, 1993, Judge Ginsburg delivered the Madison Lecture at New York
University School of Law and observed that Roe v. Wade "halted a political process that was
moving in a reform direction and thereby, I believe, prolonged divisiveness and deferred
stable settlement of the issue."121 She noted that the Court "seemed entirely to remove
the ball from the legislators' court."122

        Judge Ginsburg had previously observed in 1992 that "[t]he Roe decision, by stopping
a political process that was moving in a reform direction, may have prolonged divisiveness
and deferred stable settlement of the abortion controversy."

        Judge Ginsburg wrote in a 1990 article: "There was at the time [of Roe], as Justice
Blackmun noted in his opinion, a distinct trend in the states 'toward liberalization of
abortion statutes.' Had the Court written smaller and shorter, the legislative trend might
have continued in the direction in which is was clearly headed in the early 1970s."124

        She wrote in 1985 that, in Roe, the Court "called into question the criminal abortion
statutes of every state, even those with the least restrictive provisions."125 In doing so, the

decision "ventured too far in the change it ordered."126 Judge Ginsburg agreed with the
assessment of Professor Paul Freund, namely, that the Court "properly invalidated the Texas
proscription" but should have "left off at that point" so that "the legislative trend might have
continued in the direction in which it was headed in the early 1970s."127 Professor Freund
had written in 1983 that the detailed trimester framework in Roe "illustrated a troublesome
tendency of the modern Supreme Court...to specify by a kind of legislative code the one
alternative pattern that will satisfy the Constitution'."12*

                                                   3. Analysis

         Not everyone agrees with Judge Ginsburg's reading of history. The New York Times
editorialized that she "was too hard on Roe and probably misread history."129 Author
David Garrow writes that her criticisms of Roe "manifest a surprising ignorance of abortion
law developments in the five years preceding the January 1973 decision."130

         When Judge Ginsburg, on the one hand, argues that the Court in Roe "ventured too
far"131 and should have "written smaller and shorter"132 and, on the other hand,
challenges Roe's doctrinal foundation, she suggests that her preferred equal protection
theory would be less expansive than the due process theory the Court adopted. In fact,
however, her recommended alternative has no limitation whatsoever.

        Judge Ginsburg has offered no reason, and none is apparent, why a law prohibiting
abortion for a particular reason-even sex selection-or during a particular stage of
pregnancy-even the ninth month-would not amount to sex discrimination just as readily as
would a law prohibiting all abortions. If restricting a course of action that only women can
take is prohibited sex discrimination, then it is so throughout pregnancy. Restriction on sex
selection abortions or on late-term abortions only affect women.

        Judge Ginsburg has, on the one hand, criticized the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade
decision for going too far in striking down an abortion restriction while, on the other hand,
criticizing the Supreme Court for going too far in upholding restrictions on public funding
of abortions. The Court has consistently held that the Constitution does not require the
state to pay for abortions under any circumstances. Judge Ginsburg has criticized these
decisions as "incongruous"133 and the "[m]ost unsettling of the losses" for women's
rights.134 She wrote in 1985: "If the Court had acknowledged a woman's equality aspect,
not simply a patient-physician autonomy constitutional dimension to the abortion issue, a
majority perhaps might have" ruled differently.135

        One would think from Judge Ginsburg's criticism of both the due process theory of '
abortion rights and the Court's abortion funding cases that the Court had decided the
funding cases on a due process rationale. Not so. It applied the equal protection clause.

         In Maker v. Roe,136 the Court held that the equal protection clause does not
          require a state to pay expenses for elective abortions when it chooses to pay
          expenses for childbirth.

         In Poelker v. Doe,137 the Court held that the equal protection clause does not
          require a city to provide publicly financed hospital facilities for abortions when it
          provides such facilities for childbirth.

          In Harris v. McRae,13* the Court held that the so-called Hyde Amendment, which
          restricts the use of funds in the federal Medicaid program to pay for abortions, does
          not violate the equal protection clause.

         In Williams v. Zbaraz,139 the Court held that a funding restriction similar to the
          Hyde Amendment in a state statute does not violate the equal protection
          component of the Fifth Amendment.

           In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,140 the Court held that a statutory
            restriction on the use of public employees or facilities for abortions does not violate
            the equal protection clause.

          One can only conclude that Judge Ginsburg simply thinks that the government is
 obligated to pay for abortions, regardless of how the equal protection clause applies. It
 appears, at least in this area, that Judge Ginsburg is willing to have "the Supreme Court step
 boldly in front of the political process,"Mlexactly what she criticized the Court for doing
 in Roe.

          On the one hand, Judge Ginsburg writes that "the legislative trend"142 of the 1960s
 and early 1970s should have been allowed to continue "in the reform direction."143 On the
 other hand, she writes: "Nor can the political process be relied upon to respond to the plight
 of the indigent woman."144 It appears she only opts for allowing the legislative process to
 operate in the abortion area as long as it is heading in a "reform direction" toward results
 she approves.

          Is Judge Ginsburg's preferred theory-equal protection-more modest or more
 expansive than the Supreme Court's preferred theory-due process-has been? Does Judge
 Ginsburg think that the legislative process should be allowed to move toward a "stable
 settlement of the abortion controversy"145 or doesn't she? She apparently equates "stable
 settlement" with widely available legal abortion.

          Judge Ginsburg writes that "the Roe v. Wade decision is not fairly described as
 'moderate'"146 and elsewhere described that decision as "no measured motion."147 Yet
 it is not at all clear that her preferred theory makes any more sense or is any more
 moderate. Judge Ginsburg has made it clear that her theory could be used to require public
: financing of abortions and a cursory look suggests that her theory could be used to eliminate
 restrictions that Roe v. Wade would allow.

                                             V. CONCLUSION

        Judicial philosophy and judicial style are two very different facets of a judicial
nominee. Judicial philosophy encompasses a nominee's fundamental views about the role
of courts and the difference between law and politics, between judges and policy makers.
Judge Ginsburg has an activist judicial philosophy.

         * She believes that the Supreme Court can, and sometimes should, change its
           interpretation of the Constitution because of social changes.148

        * She believes that the Supreme Court can, and sometimes should, creatively
           interpret constitutional provisions in order to accommodate a modern vision of
           society.149

         * She believes in the need for "interventionist"judicial decisions when legislatures do
           not or will not act.150

         * She believes that "boldly dynamic interpretation" that departs "radically from the
           original understanding" is sometimes necessary to reach certain results.151

         * She believes the Constitution can survive only if supported by judicial
           interpretations that are neither too "mushy" or too "rigid." She believes that
           a jurisprudence of original understanding is toorigid.15*

        Judicial style is a combination of practical factors that describe the functioning, rather
than the role, of a judge. Judge Ginsburg has a moderate judicial style. It is only in this
sense that she can be called a "moderate," the label that so many are so quick to place on
her.

         * She opposes frequently writing separate opinions.154

         * She believes that judges should write no more than necessary to decide a particular
            case and should "take the low ground, and resist personal commentary" when
           writing for the court."5

        Judge Ginsburg's views on abortion and Roe v. Wade are driven by her politics.
Consistent with her activist judicial philosophy, she believes the Supreme Court quite
properly involved itself in the abortion controversy, and should have done so by striking
down the restrictive law at issue in Roe on equal protection, rather than on due process,
grounds. This way, the Court could have encouraged a liberalizing political trend that, in
Judge Ginsburg's view, recognizes the independence of women in our society.

         Consistent with her moderate judicial style, Judge Ginsburg has criticized the
Supreme Court for going beyond invalidating the Texas law and announcing a set of
complicated rules that effectively struck down all other abortion restrictions-tough as well
as lenient-existing in 1973, and most of those enacted since.

        Judge Ginsburg's preferred equal protection theory, however, has serious conceptual
problems. Most important, men and women cannot be similarly situated with respect to
either pregnancy or its termination and, as such, it is impossible to discuss whether women
are being treated "equally" because of their gender. Since women are the sole focus of this
view, applying an equal protection theory to abortion rights necessarily means defining any
restriction on abortion-a course of action that only women can take-as impermissible sex
discrimination. As such, this theory would go beyond the policy established by Roe v. Wade.
Judge Ginsburg objects to the Supreme Court's decisions that the state is not constitutionally
required to pay for abortions, even though the Court applied her preferred equal protection
theory in those cases.

                                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

         Pundits and politicians rushed to label Ruth Bader Ginsburg a "moderate" without
knowing virtually anything about her record. This reaction had more to do with who she
is not--Bruce Babbitt, Jon Newman, Mario Cuomo, Laurence Tribe--than who she is.

         The record shows that Judge Ginsburg is no moderate. The Judicial Selection
Monitoring Project's first report, A Step in the Left Direction, documented how her scholarly
writings reveal a strikingly activist judicial philosophy and an arguably moderate judicial
style. On issues that really matter, however, her record belies any moderation at alL Her
politics drive her jurisprudence.

         This second report, The Continuing Searchfor Moderation, summarizes these findings
and goes on to examine Judge Ginsburg's record on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with an eye
toward whether she tempers her judicial activism in practice. The "moderate" label so
quickly and confidently placed on Judge Ginsburg would predict such a pattern. In addition,
mid-level appellate courts have built-in factors that can temper judicial activism-Supreme
Court precedent, circuit precedent, etc. Judge Ginsburg herself has written about such
factors that "tug" judges on those courts toward moderation.

         The jurisdiction of the judicial circuit on which Judge Ginsburg serves makes the task
of assessing her judicial philosophy particularly difficult This circuit's docket includes a
heavy dose of administrative law and includes, for example, only a narrow range of criminal
cases. Even so, Judge Ginsburg's record provides many examples of how she breaks her
own rules of moderation by writing separately about issues not before the court and giving
dissertations on the law outside of the case at hand. In key areas-e.g^ separation of powers,
standing, civil rights-her opinions reveal a pattern of picking and choosing approaches and
selective application of doctrines to create a striking parallel with the liberal political
agenda. A Step in the Left Direction showed how, in her scholarly writings, Judge Ginsburg's
politics drive her jurisprudence. likewise, The Continuing Searchfor Moderation reveals how
this same activism is apparent in her judicial record.

         Judge Ginsburg believes that courts and legislatures are interchangeable players in
the search for sound public policy; that courts should be restrained only when legislatures
are activist; that courts should change interpretation of the Constitution in light of social and
political developments; that courts can move beyond reviewing legislation to actually
"repairing" i t She has shown that even the inherent constraints of a mid-level appellate
court have not seriously tempered this activism. She has written that the factors tugging
judges toward moderation on such a court do not exist on the court to which she has been
nominated.

         The record belies the pundits. Judge Ginsburg is no moderate. She has a strikingly
activist judicial philosophy and has shown her willingness to abandon even her nominally
moderate judicial style in the service of politically correct results.

        On June 14,1993, after more than 12 weeks of consideration, President Bill Clinton
nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to replace retiring U.S. Supreme Court
Associate Justice Byron White. The Judicial Selection Monitoring Project published its first
report on the Ginsburg nomination, A Step in the Left Direction, on June 24. That report
focused on Judge Ginsburg's scholarly writings. This second report includes discussion of
her judicial opinions and assembles more dues about Judge Ginsburg's judicial philosophy.
Both reports are intended to provide information as the Senate seeks to fulfill its
constitutional role of advice and consent and in considering the Ginsburg nomination.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

        Analysts, reporters, and politicians quickly rushed to label Judge Ginsburg a
"moderate" within minutes of her nomination. None of them, of course, even attempted to
define that term. Determining how a former general counsel of the American Civil
liberties Union and a pioneering women's rights activist could be labeled "moderate" led
to publication otA Step in the Left Direction. Defining, and distinguishing between, judicial
philosophy and judicial style, the report concluded that the "moderate" label applies only to
the latter and only for the moment

        More serious study of Judge Ginsburg's record has produced doubts about this
"moderate" label. For example, noting that Ruth Bader Ginsburg prompted the ACLU to
adopt a radical position on the issue of sex between adults and children while she was its
general counsel, Human Events asked: "How * Moderate'Is Ruth Ginsburg?"2 Writing in
the New Republic, Mickey Kaus described thinlritig that the label "moderate" sounded
legitimate until he read her writings. "Now," he writes, "I'm not so sure."3

         When evaluating Republican nominees, Senate Democrats and their allies in the
academy and interest groups strongly argued for the relevance of extra-judicial writings, the
focus of A Step in the Left Direction. Testifying in 1987 against the Supreme Court
nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Bork, law professor Paul Gewirtz countered those
who argued against considering the nominee's academic writings by stating that "virtually all
academics write to express what they believe to be the truth. We may try out ideas that we
later conclude are wrong, but..law professors try to say what they really believe. Thus, what
we write is always revealing."4 Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), a member of the
Judiciary Committee, declared at the hearing on Judge Ginsburg's former judicial colleague
Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court that "[t]he pre-judidal record and
positions of a nominee are usually a good indicator of what kind of judge that nominee will
be."5

         Significantly, these liberal activists demanded consideration of Republican nominees'
academic writings that entirely pre-dated any service in the judiciary and never attempted
to explain their relevance to a nominee's judicial philosophy. Rather, they simply
highlighted political results. Most of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's scholarship, on the other hand,
was published after she joined the U.S. Court of Appeals, making it even more relevant than
even the Democratic standard suggests. The reports on the Ginsburg nomination from the
Judicial Selection Monitoring Project are careful to focus attention on the nominee's judicial
philosophy rather than political results.

         A Step in the Left Direction distinguished between Judge Ginsburg's activist judicial
philosophy and her moderate judicial style and suggested that the latter might just give way
should she join the Supreme Court Mickey Kaus' analysis followed a strikingly similar line.
He wrote: "When it comes to judging, there are many species of moderation. One variety
reflects a disciplined interpretation of the Constitution, Another reflects mere caution."6
He concluded that "Ginsburg's cautious, case-by-case approach...appears less like congenital
"moderation'than the option-preserving tactics of a shrewd litigator.~.By being * moderate'
today, she frees herself to be immoderate tomorrow."7

           Summarizing the findings from A Step in the Left Direction provides a useful
backdrop for this analysis of Judge Ginsburg's judicial decisions.

                                        A. Activist Judicial Philosophy

         Judge Ginsburg has a dearly activist judicial philosophy. She blurs the line between
the judicial and political branches of government, between judges and policymakers, and
between law and politics. Her writings evidence this activist philosophy in several ways.

         First, Judge Ginsburg believes that the Supreme Court can, and sometimes should,
change its interpretation of the Constitution based on "a growing comprehension by jurists
of a pervasive change in society at large."* She has written approvingly of how "[p]ervasive
social changes" undermine the reasoning of undesirable Supreme Court precedents.9

         Second, she approves of the Supreme Court "creatively interpret[ing]" constitutional
provisions to implement "a modern vision" of society.10 She supports "(b]oldly dynamic
interpretation, departing radically from the original understanding" to achieve desirable
political results.11

         Third, Judge Ginsburg believes that courts and legislatures are interchangeable
players in the effort to achieve good public policy. She writes that courts should achieve
desirable political results when legislatures do not "shoulder[] their full responsibility for
activist dedsionmaking."12 Judicial restraint is only appropriate when legislatures are
activist.

         Fourth, Judge Ginsburg's politics drive her jurisprudence. Some examples:

         * When campaigning for adoption of the so-called equal right amendment to the U.S.
            Constitution, she says the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
            does not protect women.13

         * When championing the feminist cause in court, she argues quite successfully that
            the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does indeed protect
           women.14

         * When promoting the equal rights amendment, she calls the claim that the measure
           would support abortion rights "an inflammatory, but not an accurate charge."15

         * When criticizing the Supreme Court's abortion doctrine, she insists that an equal
            protection theory, rather than a due process theory, should provide the basis for
            abortion rights.

Anyone who confuses the political and judicial branches of government as much as Judge
Ginsburg does has a fundamentally activist judicial philosophy. H i e term "moderate" does
not fairly describe these views. Then why have so many given Judge Ginsburg this label?

                                          B. Moderate Judicial Style

         While judicial philosophy refers to one's views of the role of a judge, "judicial style"
refers to practical considerations guiding the functioning of a judge. Only with respect to
these prudential factors can Judge Ginsburg be called a moderate.

         First, Judge Ginsburg has discouraged what she calls "individualist judging,"17 the
practice of frequently writing separate opinions. Judge Ginsburg opts "to acquiesce" rather
than "to go it alone."18 She wrote in 1985: "I don't see myself in the role of a great
dissenter and I would much rather carry another mind even if it entails certain
compromises."19

               See, e g , Colifano v. CMdfarb,430 U S . 199 (1977); Craig v. Bonn, 429 U S . 190 (1976); Weinberger

                                      632

         Second, Judge Ginsburg has written that, when a judge does write for a court's
majority rather than separately, he or she "should take the low ground, and resist personal
commentary."20

         Third, Judge Ginsburg has criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade,21
which not only struck down the very restrictive Texas statute before the Court but
announced a complicated set of rules that effectively rendered all other abortion laws
invalid, as having "ventured too far in the change it ordered."22 She believes the Court
should have "written smaller and shorter."23

         In 1991, commentator Stuart Taylor called Judge Ginsburg a "careful judge not given
to crusading activism."24 Roger Pilon wrote that she "establishes herself as a "judicial
activist,' although one limited to s interstitial'activism."25 One reporter concluded that
Judge Ginsburg feels "the court should merely nudge social trends."26 She is an activist;
Taylor says she is not a "crusading" one and Pilon says she is merely an "interstitial" one.
She believes courts should move social trends; some say she would merely "nudge" them.

         Judge Ginsburg is even arguably "moderate" only with respect to this practical
measure of judicial style although, as the next section of this report will demonstrate, she
violates in practice the very rules of moderation she has expressed in scholarship. Even this
moderate judicial style may be merely a product of Judge Ginsburg's service on a mid-level
appellate court, restrained by her own court's precedents and the decisions of the Supreme
Court. Judge Ginsburg has written that on such a court, "[u]nlike the Supreme Court" which

faces "grand constitutional questions," various factors combine to "tugjudges strongly toward
the middle, toward moderation and away from startlingly creative or excessively rigid
positions. If confirmed, Judge Ginsburg will no longer serve on such a court and will
be free of that tug toward moderation.

                            C. Turning Judicial Review Into Judicial Repair

         Judge Ginsburg believes that courts should go beyond invalidating statutes they find
to violate the Constitution and should actually "repair" them. In Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld?*
for example, the Supreme Court reviewed a provision of the Social Security Act that
awarded benefits to the surviving widow of a deceased male wage earner but not to the
surviving widower of a deceased female wage earner. The Court determined that this
gender-based classification violated the Fifth Amendment, but then went beyond invalidating
the provision. The Court actually ordered Social Security payments to widowers in the
absence of any legislative provision to accomplish that result As Judge Ginsburg put it, "the
Court wrote into the statute [those] Congress had left out"29

         Such "judicial extension of underinclusive statutes"30 or "judicial repair work"31 is
appropriate, Judge Ginsburg writes, when "the class benefited by the judicial repair...[is]
limited, and the legislative will [is] minimally touched."32 She writes approvingly of courts
acting to "repair" an invalidated statute based on "[t]he probable will of the legislature."33

         This is a shockingly activist view of the proper role of unelected courts in a system
of representative government with co-equal branches. Judge Ginsburg has no problem with
courts explicitly legislating--literally writing statutes that did not otherwise exist--so long as
they do so modestly. She writes quite plainly that "appreciating that the court is legislating

seems to me the key to proper analysis of the issue."34 Determining the actual will of the
legislature is often a daunting task; courts inventing the probable will of the legislature is
license for independent legislation by the judicial branch. And even then, whether acting
on the basis of the actual or probable will of the legislature, courts have no authority to do
anything but invalidate a legislative enactment that violates the Constitution. Courts do not
have authority to write new legislation.

         Just as Judge Ginsburg thinks courts and legislatures are interchangeable players in
developing desirable public policy, so she also equates judicial review with judicial repair.
Judge Ginsburg writes that, without the power of "judicial repair," unconstitutional statutes
would be "immunize[d] from judicial review"*5 and legislating would be left "to the political
branches without judicial oversight"36 This is patently absurd. Legislatures have the power
to legislate. Courts have the power to review that legislation and determine whether it
contravenes the Constitution. When it does, such legislation is void. This dramatic power
literally to invalidate the actions of the elected branches is the essence, not the absence, of
judicial review. Indeed, "judicial oversight" is perhaps too modest a label for this power.

                              D. A "Moderate" Theory of Abortion Rights?

         In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that the "liberty" protected by the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment37 includes "a woman's decision whether or
not to terminate her pregnancy."38 That theory has been applied in the years since 1973
to strike down virtually any restriction on abortion.

                                         635

         Judge Ginsburg has criticized the Court for basing its abortion doctrine on the due
process clause rather than the equal protection clause.39 In a 1992 article, Judge Ginsburg
wrote that "the Supreme Court did not rest its Roe v. Wade decision on an equal stature for
women or sex discrimination rationale. Instead, the Court ruled on a personal privacy or
autonomy analysis that had few precedents."40

                                            1. an immoderate theory

         The combination of Judge Ginsburg's criticism oiRoe as "venturing too far" and her
criticism of the decision's doctrinal foundation suggests that her preferred equal protection
theory for abortion rights would be more moderate. At least two aspects of this theory,
however, demonstrate otherwise.

         First, applying the equal protection theory to abortion rights really means ignoring
any discussion of "equality" as between similarly situated men and women and focusing
instead solely on women. This, in turn, results in defining any abortion restriction as
impermissible sex discrimination.

         "The Constitution requires that [government] treat similarly situated persons
similarly."41 Yet men and women cannot be similarly situated with respect to either
pregnancy or its termination. Claiming that abortion restrictions constitute discrimination
against women on the basis of gender requires reference to the treatment of similarly
situated persons of a different gender, namely, men. Anyone can see the conceptual
difficulty this immediately creates. James Bopp concludes: "Logically, if pregnant women
are not similarly situated with respect to nonpregnant persons, a law prohibiting abortion
would not be a denial of equal protection to all women as a class and, therefore, not gender
discrimination."42

             39
                Hie Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause reads: "[nor shall any State--] deny to any

person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." While the Fifth Amendment, which applies to
the federal government, does not contain a similar clause, the Supreme Court has decided that its due process
 clause has an equal protection component and has thereby imposed the same restrictions on the federal
 government that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on state governments. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfcld, 420
 VS. 636,638 nj. (1975); Boiling v. Sharp*, 347 U.S. 497 (19S4).

                                      636

         Since men cannot become pregnant and, therefore, cannot be situated similarly with
women regarding pregnancy or its termination, the argument must necessarily take a
different form and focus exclusively on women. Doing so actually requires ignoring the
"equal" protection clause which, again, guarantees that similarly situated individuals be
treated similarly. Even though an exclusive focus on women necessarily negates the entire
equal protection argument, Judge Ginsburg wants just such a focus. She has written that
Roe would be less subject to criticism "had the Court placed the woman alone...at the center
of its attention."43

         Focusing exclusively on women, as Judge Ginsburg insists, not only requires ignoring
the very constitutional provision on which her theory supposedly rests, but it further
complicates the argument Restricting abortion means restricting a course of action that
only women can pursue. As such, the theory must contend, restricting abortion is sex
discrimination and a denial of equal protection by definition. One of Judge Ginsburg's
former law clerks summarized this view: "Hie disadvantageous treatment of a woman
because of pregnancy or reproductive choice, Judge Ginsburg has written, is a paradigm
case of discrimination on the basis of sex."44 Roger Pilon counters:

                   Disadvantageous treatment of a woman because of her
                  pregnancy is treatment based, as the proposition states, on her
                  pregnancy, nor her sex. Otherwise every woman would be so
                   treated, which not even Judge Ginsburg asserts. It is true, of
                   course, that only women become pregnant But from that fact
                   it no more follows that pregnancy discrimination is sex
                   discrimination than that punishment for having committed a
                   crime is punishment for being a person-it being a fact also that
                   only people commit crimes.

         It is hardly a moderate position to assert that restricting a course of action that only
women can pursue is, by definition, discrimination on the basis of sex. While Judge
Ginsburg apparently feels that the Court did too much at one time in Roe v. Wade, over the
long term her theory would mandate more radical results than the theory announced in Roe.

                                      637

         Judge Ginsburg's preferred theory for abortion rights is far from moderate for a
second reason. She has insisted that the case for constitutional protection of abortion rights
is less about "state versus private control of a woman's body for a span of nine months"46
than it is about "a woman's autonomous charge of her full life's course [or] her ability to
stand in relation to man, society, and the state as an independent, self-sustaining, equal
citizen."47 For this reason she has recently suggested support48 for the Supreme Court's
decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey,49 which also stated that the "ability of women to
participate equally in the economic and sodal life of the Nation has been facilitated by their
ability to control their reproductive lives."50

         This is a concrete example of one facet of Judge Ginsburg's activist judicial
philosophy. She believes that judges can, and sometimes should, drive social trends, as well
as respond to favorable sodal and political developments, through "creative" or "dynamic"
changes in constitutional interpretation. In the context of abortion rights, Judge Ginsburg
believes that federal courts have the authority simply to choose a particular sodal or
political development of which they approve, or a preferred social theory, and then to
change interpretation of the Constitution itself in order to accommodate those developments
or theories.

         This is truly a radical theory. Whatever a judge feels would help women "partiripate
in the economic and sodal life of the Nation" could be constitutionally mandated through
the equal protection clause. Mickey Kaus writes:

                  It could be used to argue that abortion must be subsidized by
                  the state as well as permitted....It could justify affirmative
                  discrimination designed to compensate women for the extra
                  burden of childrearing. It could even be used to strike down
                  laws that are non-discriminatory on their face but that don't
                  make allowances for women's reproductive disadvantage. (Is

         In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that elected representatives of the people
may not choose one theory of life, namely, that it begins at conception, on which to base its
regulation of abortion.52 Yet Judge Ginsburg apparently believes that unelected federal
judges are perfectly free to choose one theory of social and political relations on which to
base their interpretation of the Constitution. By thus putting the Constitution in the service
of politics, Judge Ginsburg provides a clear example of a shockingly activist judicial
philosophy.

                                             2. immoderate results

         Judge Ginsburg's criticism of the due process basis for the Supreme Court's abortion
doctrine is merely a function of political expediency. As noted above, she stressed the due
process theory when trying to blunt criticism of the equal rights amendment When she says
that the decision in Roe "ventured too far in the change it ordered,"53 "seemed entirely to
remove the ball from the legislators' court,"54 and "called into question the criminal
abortion statutes in every state, even those with the least restrictive provisions,"55 she is not
criticizing the Court's failure to properly settle the constitutional issue. Rather, she is
criticizing the Court's interruption of what she saw as progress toward a "stable
settlement"56 of the political issue. As she criticizes the Court for supposedly overreaching,
in the same scholarly breath Judge Ginsburg laments that Roe "halted a political process
that was moving in a reform direction."57 She wants the job of broadening access to
abortion accomplished and thinks that legislative liberalization rather thanjudicial fiat might
be the best method at the moment

         Any suggestion that Judge Ginsburg, by simultaneously criticizing Roe's doctrinal
foundation and seemingly excessive political impact, would achieve more modest political
results with her preferred equal protection theory is belied by her own writings. The
Supreme Court has, in fact, applied the equal protection theory to abortion restrictions. In
doing so, it has consistently held that the government is not constitutionally required to pay

for abortions under any circumstances.38 Judge Ginsburg has criticized these decisions as
"incongruous"39 and the "(m]ost unsettling of the losses" for woman's rights.60 This is just
one example of how Judge Ginsburg's application of the equal protection theory would
invalidate restrictions that the Supreme Court has upheld under Roe. Mickey Kaus writes
that "Ginsburg strongly implies that she would require government funding of abortions-
hardly the vmoderate*position."61

         The bottom line is that Judge Ginsburg supports widely available legal abortion and
chooses her social, political, and constitutional theories--as well as offers her praise and
critidsm-accordingly. Her politics drive her jurisprudence. It would be difficult to find a
clearer example of judicial activism.

                 .FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BENCH TO THE OTHER

         Many analysts and activists continue to evaluate judges on the basis of the winners
and losers in legal cases. In a recent column, for example, law professor David Cole
described what he believes is Judge Ginsburg's "vision of justice" by a checklist of those with
whom Judge Ginsburg "has sided" in her judicial decisions.62 She has, he claims, "sided
with conservatives"63 on issues such as gay rights, racial discrimination, and criminal law.
On the other hand, Cole observes, "she has authored opinions favorable to" liberal interests
in other categories of cases.64 He hopes she will be "a justice who is sympathetic to the
claims of the politically weak."63 In other words, she will be a good justice if she produces

         This is the wrong way to evaluate judges and Judge Ginsburg herself has suggested
that she may not subscribe to this blatantly political approach to justice, criticizing those who
blast the judiciary when their own "ox is being gored" rather than on a more principled
basis.66 This analysis, too, will attempt to evaluate Judge Ginsburg's record while on the
U.S. Court of Appeals by what it reveals of her judicial philosophy rather than merely by
a tally of winners and losers. It highlights 37 cases out of the hundreds in which Judge
Ginsburg wrote majority or separate opinions.

                                    A. A Judicial Record in PersDective

         With the analysis of Judge Ginsburg's scholarly writings offered in A Step in the Left
Direction and summarized above as a backdrop, this report moves on to survey the
nominee's judicial record on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
to discover more clues about her judicial philosophy. For several reasons, this record is less
reflective than it might be. First, the jurisdiction of the D.C. Circuit is dominated by
regulatory and administrative law issues. These cases require the court merely to decide
whether an agency adequately evaluated the basis for and alternatives to action it seeks to
take.67 At the same time, the court's docket is light on cases involving substantive
constitutional issues or other elements that are more reflective of an individual's judicial
philosophy.

         Second, the Supreme Court is a fundamentally different court than the U.S. Court
of Appeals. Judge Ginsburg herself has distinguished the two, writing that on mid-level
appellate courts, M[u]nlike the Supreme Court," which do not face "grand constitutional
questions," certain factors serve to "tug judges strongly toward the middle, toward
moderation."68 If confirmed, she will no longer be on a court where those factors tug
judges toward moderation, but will be on the Supreme Court, facing grand constitutional
questions, where judges' own predilections have freer rein.

         Significantly, those riding on Judge Ginsburg's welcome wagon seem to forget the
dogged insistence by Senate Democrats and liberal activists about this very point, albeit
directed at Republican nominees. Law professor Laurence Tribe, testifying against the

evaluated alternatives to its planned submarine testing range in Alaska and adequately evaluated its impact on
the local tourist industry).

Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork in 1987, described the "fundamental difference
between being on a court of appeals where one is operating within the bounds of precedent
and being on the Supreme Court where one is making precedent."69 He stressed the need
to examine a nominee's extra-judicial writings and speeches "as a guide to what [a nominee]
might do upon [the Supreme] Court"70

         Similarly, law professor Paul Gewirtz testified at the same hearing:

                  A Court of Appeals judge is obliged by his position in the
                  judicial hierarchy to carry out Supreme Court precedent, and
                  knows that if that obligation is ignored there is a higher court
                  to reverse him. A Supreme Court Justice has much greater
                  power because of the importance of the cases that come to the
                  Court and because a Justice has the leeway to overrule prior
                  Court decisions. In exercising the more extensive leeway that
                  typically exists in cases before the Supreme Court, a Justice is
                  likely to draw more' extensively upon his or her deep-seated
                   convictions about what the Constitution means and what a
                  Justice's role is.71

         Third, not only is a mid-level appellate judge bound by the Supreme Court, she is
also bound by her own circuit's precedents. Changing the law is significantly easier on the
Supreme Court than on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Three-judge appellate panels cannot
change the law of a circuit by overruling another panel's decision on a particular point of
law. There must be a motion for the entire circuit to re-hear a panel's decision and only
the entire circuit can change the law of that circuit, something it is very reluctant to do. The
entire Supreme Court, in contrast, considers each case and can change its own precedents
without any similar intervening step.

                               B. Breaking Her Own Rules of Moderation

         Judge Ginsburg's scholarly writings, as presented in A Step in the Left Direction and
summarized above, demonstrate a strikingly activist judicial philosophy. The next question
is whether she has similarly demonstrated her activism while on the bench. Those who have
rushed to label Judge Ginsburg a moderate seem to assume that she has not Again,
 analysis of the actual record belies the quick assertions of the pundits.

                                     1. straying from the issues at hand

         Judge Ginsburg has criticized "individualist judging,"72 the practice of writing
separate opinions, as well as judges who address issues not necessary for deciding the case
in front of them. Yet in Federal Election Commission v. International Funding InstituteTM
she violated both of her own rules. In that case, the court, sitting en bane, upheld a Federal
Election Commission rule forbidding the use of campaign fundraising lists by other political
organizations. Judge Ginsburg wrote a separate statement to give a dissertation on how
"taxing and spending dedsions..ron seriously interfere with the exercise of constitutional
freedoms."74 She specifically cited one of the Supreme Court's abortion funding decisions
to assert that a "substantial constitutional question" would arise if the government withheld
all Medicaid funding from women seeking abortions.75

         This gratuitous statement not only had nothing to do with the case before the court,
belying a moderate judicial style, but it was a wrong statement of the law. Judge Ginsburg
cited the 1980 decision in Harris v. McRae,16 yet failed to cite several other funding cases,
including the 1989 decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services.71 The Court has
never held that denial of Medicaid benefits for abortion by either the state or federal
government violates the Constitution under any circumstances. Judge Ginsburg has long
insisted that these cases were wrongly decided, but they are the law nonetheless. Her
gratuitous misstatement of the law in such an area that she cares particularly about raises
doubts about her "moderation" and adherence to precedent when freed from any constraints
on the Supreme Court

         In Dronenberg v. Zech,n Judge Ginsburg had criticized Judge Robert Bork for
including in his opinion "a commentarial exposition of the opinion writer's viewpoint"79
Yet that is exactly what Judge Ginsburg offered about a topic-abortion funding-that she

has written extensively about in the past. The relevance of abortion funding to a case
involving Federal Election Commission regulations is not self-evident She apparently
breaks her own rules when it suits her.

                                       2. straying from the law at hand

         As noted above, mid-level appellate courts are bound by both their own precedents
and the decisions of the Supreme Court In her own opinions, Judge Ginsburg often
emphasizes this fact, repeatedly daiming-whether accurately or not^-that Supreme Court
decisions compel her conclusions. Judge Ginsburg has, however, again broken her own rules
about writing separately to gratuitously address policy issues.

         In Federal Labor Relations Authority v. U.S. Department of the Treasury,'1 for
example, the court ruled that an FLRA order requiring disclosure by federal agencies of
their employees' names to a federal employees' union violated the Privacy A c t Judge
Ginsburg wrote separately to state that she "reluctantly"82 agreed with the result because
the Supreme Court's interpretation of the relevant statutes required i t She wrote that the
Supreme Court should reconsider the issue and expressed her clear preference for the
"public interest in the [collective] bargaining representative's ready access to unit employees"
over the employees' "modest privacy interests."83

         In Government Employees Local 1843 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority',Mthe court
upheld as reasonable a decision by the FLRA that an agency had not committed an unfair
labor practice by failing to withhold union dues from a reinstated employee's back pay
award. Judge Ginsburg wrote separately to state that, if she were a member of the FLRA,
she would have ruled otherwise, a statement hardly necessary to dedde the case before
the court.

                                       C. Constitutional Interpretation

                                            1. equal protection cases

         Judges cannot pick their subject matter the way professors can. While the bulk of
Judge Ginsburg's academic scholarship addressed the equal protection clause and gender
discrimination, she has rarely addressed these issues as a judge.

         In Quiban v. Veterans Administration?6 Philippine World War II veterans and a
deceased veteran's surviving spouse challenged federal statutes that excluded them from
eligibility for veterans' benefit programs. They claimed this exclusion violated the Fifth
Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. The court of appeals reversed the district
court's grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.

         This case raised two basic questions: the proper standard of review, and the result
when applying that standard of review. Judge Ginsburg was careful to base her answer to
both questions explicitly on Supreme Court precedent She first concluded that, "[u]nder
binding Supreme Court precedent,"*7 the lenient "rational basis test" rather than the "strict
scrutiny test" should apply. She then found that "[t]he classifications in question, controlling
authority instructs, have the requisite rationality."88 She stressed this point again at the
close of her opinion: This case is controlled by [Supreme Court precedent], both as to the
standard of review and as to the merits of the constitutional challenge. Under the lenient
[Supreme Court] standard, we must conclude that section 107-while hardly generous to
veterans of the Philippine Army and the New Philippine Scouts-is constitutional."*'

         Judge Ginsburg's response to one argument is noteworthy, albeit also based squarely
on Supreme Court precedent Counsel for an amicus argued that the plaintiffs were being
discriminated against "based on an "immutable' condition, a status they cannot change, ie.,
their status as World War II veterans of the Philippine armed forces."90 Judge Ginsburg

           8 6 928 F.2d 1154 (D.C. Or. 1991). Judges Douglas H. Ginsburg and Karen LcCraft Henderson joined
Judge Ginsburg's opinion.

responded that "the 'immutable characteristic' notion, as it appears in Supreme Court
decisions, is tightly-cabined. It does not mean, broadly, something done that cannot be
undone. Instead, it is a trait 'determined solely by accident of birth.1"91

         This decision might be consistent with a restrained judicial philosophy, one not given
to creating new rights or turning wants into entitlements. Yet it begs the question whether
Judge Ginsburg herself holds these views, or would have decided these issues the same way
in the absence of controlling Supreme Court precedent

                                      2. first amendment religion cases

                                             a. free exercise clause

         The First Amendment guarantees that "Congress shall make no law...prohibiting the
free exercise [of religion]."92 In Goldman v. Secretary of Defense,93 a Jewish physician who
had served in the military for 14 years faced court-martial for insisting on wearing a
yarmulke in addition to his military uniform. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld
the action against Goldman, who made a motion for the entire court to re-hear the case.
Judge Ginsburg, joined by then-Judge Antonin Scalia, dissented from the majority's decision
not to re-hear the case. She stated her belief that the military's action "suggests 'callous
indifference' to Dr. Goldman's religious faith, and it runs counter to 'the best of our
traditions' to 'accommodate^ the public service to theQ spiritual needs [of our people]."*94

         Judge Ginsburg expressed agreement with the opinion of Judge Kenneth Starr, also
dissenting from the denial of re-hearing, who likewise cited "the spirit of accommodation
which the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, requires."93

         This short statement by Judge Ginsburg is frequently mentioned in the media, though
only with reference to the outcome it urges--upholding an individual's right to exercise his
religion. Yet it reveals little by itself about Judge Ginsburg's own agreement or
disagreement with the Supreme Court's emphasis on accommodation or the principles she

feels are important in interpreting constitutional provisions such as the free exercise clause.
Does she believe that some kind of subjective "callous indifference" standard should be
applied? Would she look to the meaning of "free exercise" intended by those who framed
that constitutional language? Her brief statement in Goldman certainly does not answer
these questions, though their answer would seem essential to a proper evaluation of Judge
Ginsburg's nomination to the Supreme Court, which has the power to shape free exercise
jurisprudence.

         In Leahy v. District of Columbia,96 an individual raised a religious objection against
the District of Columbia's regulation that each applicant for a driver's license provide his
Social Security number. The district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary
judgment and dismissed the case. Judge Ginsburg, for the court of appeals,97 concluded
that the district court had misread a relevant Supreme Court precedent and applied a test
that only a minority of the Court had approved. Judge Ginsburg stated the correct test and
applied it to conclude that the government had not met its burden. She then remanded the
case to the district court to determine the sincerity of the plaintiffs religious belief.

         In Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration,96 an individual claimed to be a priest
in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. Claiming that the church's sacrament was marijuana,
he sought a religious-use exemption from federal law prohibiting use of the drug.
Acknowledging that the government has a compelling interest in preventing marijuana use,
Judge Ginsburg concluded that the pivotal issue "is whether marijuana usage by [members
of the church] can be accommodated without undue interference with the government's
interest in controlling the drug."99 Following the lead of the U.S. Courts of Appeals for
the First, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits, she dedded that "[w]e have no reason to doubt that
these courts have accurately gauged the Highest Court's pathmarks in this area"100 and
affirmed the district court's denial of an exemption.

                                            b. establishment clause

         In Murray v. BuchananTM1 taxpayers challenged payment of salaries and expenses
for chaplains serving the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The district
court dismissed the complaint The court of appeals held that, under Supreme Court
precedent,102 payment of such salaries and expenses did not violate the establishment
clause of the First Amendment103 Judge Ginsburg, joined by Senior Judge David
Bazelon, concurred in a separate statement She declined to give her own discussion of the
constitutional issue, resting instead on the "unambiguousf]"10* instruction from the
Supreme Court on how the case should be decided on the merits.

                                   3. first amendment free speech cases

         In American Postal Workers Union v. United States Postal Service,105 a postal
employee was fired for claiming, in an article promoting universal unionization in his union
newsletter, to have read the mail he had been handling. He challenged his discharge as
violating the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The district court ruled for the
employee. The court of appeals, in an opinion by Chief Judge Patricia Wald joined by
Judge Ginsburg, affirmed. The employee, however, was not discharged for having written
an article or for expressing a particular opinion about unionization. Rather, the employee
was discharged for having read the mail he was handling, albeit a fact revealed in a
newsletter article. This distinction can easily be demonstrated by observing that he could
have expressed his views about unionization without admitting to the unlawful behavior.
Unable to distinguish between a subject of public concern (unionization) and an admission
of unlawful behavior, the court held that the first effectively sanctified the second. It
appears that a subjective appraisal of the results in this case prevented the court from
observing this necessary distinction.

         Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Watt106 provides an example of Judge
Ginsburg's politics driving her jurisprudence. In this case, the National Park Service issued
a permit to the Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV) to conduct a round-the-
clock demonstration on the Mall and in Lafayette Park to draw attention to the plight of the
homeless but denied the participants a permit to sleep in those locations because sleeping
would violate the Park Service's anti-camping regulations. Maiming that sleeping is an
exercise of free speech, CCNV brought suit to invalidate the permit's limitation on sleeping.
The district court ruled for the Park Service. The court of appeals, sitting en bane, reversed.
Judge Ginsburg agreed with the result, though she found the case "close and difficult"107
She rejected then-Judge Antonin Scalia's position that the First Amendment only protected
spoken and written thought as an "arbitrary, less-than-fully baked" theory. She also
hesitated to accept the more liberal position that "the on-site sleep of a round-the-clock
demonstrator" is indistinguishable from leaflet distribution, speeches, or flag displays.109

         Instead, Judge Ginsburg insisted that "sleeping in symbolic tents" has a "personal,
non-communicative aspect" that bears a "close, functional relationship" to standing or sitting
in such tents, that is, it guarantees that a demonstrator is physically present to sustain the
round-the-clock demonstration.110 This "linkage...suffices to require a genuine effort to
balance the demonstrators' interests against [the government's] concern."111 She insists
that "the non-communicative component of the mix reflected in CCNVs request for
permission to sleep...facilitates expression."112 It remains a mystery, one that Judge
Ginsburg made no attempt to solve, why her division of sleeping into communicative and
non-communicative components is any less arbitrary or any more baked than Judge Scalia's
theory.

         What are the limits of Judge Ginsburg's theory? Would she give formal First
Amendment protection to any "non-communicative component of the mix" in a particular
case that "facilitates expression"? If so, then her theory would sweep far beyond even the
liberal position taken by the majority in this case-a position she would not join. Where
would she look for guidance about how to answer these questions? Is this a case in which
she would apply an emphasis from her scholarly writings, namely, that courts should change

their interpretation of the Constitution to accommodate a desirable vision of a just and
equitable society? Again, the answers to these questions are critical to a proper evaluation
of Judge Ginsburg's nomination to the Supreme Court

         In Action for Children's Television v. Federal Communications Commission,10 the
court reviewed an FCC regulation limiting broadcast of indecent programming to the period
from midnight to 6:00 a.m. Judge Ginsburg held that the Supreme Court's decision in FCC
v. Pacifica Foundation114 shielded the FCCs definition of "indecent" programming from
challenge but decided that the FCC had not adequately justified the time restriction for such

                                      4. fifth amendment takings cases

         Judge Ginsburg has demonstrated serious effort to keep her opinions involving the
Fifth Amendment's takings clause116 limited. In Hohri v. United States,111 the plaintiffs
sought money damages and a declaratory judgment stemming from theinternment of
Japanese-Americans during World War n . The district court dismissed allclaims. The
court of appeals affirmed, except with respect to the claim that the internment constituted
an uncompensated taking of their property inviolation of the Fifth Amendment Judge
Ginsburg joined a statement accompanying denial by the full court of appeals to re-hear the
panel decision. That statement criticized Judge Robert Bork's dissent from the denial of
re-hearing as full of"rhetorical excess"118 and evidence that he had "succumbed to the

joined- turned "on what we find to be the situation-specific holding" of relevant Supreme
Court precedents.120

         In Boston and Maine Corp. v. Interstate Commerce Commission?21 the court
reviewed an ICC decision approving a request by Amtrak to condemn miles of railroad track
and convey them to another railroad. Judge Ginsburg agreed with granting the petition for
review and remanding the case to the ICC, but stressed that 1 rely on the inadequacy of the
Commission's assessment in this case, not on the precedent-setting construction of the statute
decreed by the majority opinion."122

                                   5. fifth amendment due process cases

         In Robinson v. Palmer?33 prison officials suspended visits by an inmate's wife for
one year after she was found smuggling marijuana to him. The Department of Corrections
subsequently changed its policy to require permanent suspension of visiting privileges for
anyone attempting to bring in contraband. The inmate's wife challenged application of the
new policy to her and the district court held that her suspension could not be permanently
extended without notice and an opportunity for her to be heard. Judge Ginsburg, for the
court of appeals, reversed and held, under existing Supreme Court precedent, that a felon's
expectation of privacy is too insubstantial to invoke the full procedural protections of the
due process clause.

                                           D. Separation of Powers

         Judge Ginsburg has criticized the judicial practice of writing separate opinions123
and has emphasized that, on mid-level appellate courts, factors operate to tug judges toward
moderation.126 This may be true in cases devoid of significant issues of constitutional
import In cases raising such issues, however, Judge Ginsburg does indeed write separately
and indicates what she might do on a court where factors tugging judges toward moderation
no longer exist

         la In re Sealed Case,"1 former government officials challenged the authority of
independent counsels appointed under the Ethics in Government Act to issue subpoenas
compelling their testimony before a grand jury. The district court ruled against them. The
court of appeals reversed. Writing in dissent, Judge Ginsburg provided another example of
how her politics drive her jurisprudence128 in a case involving a "grand constitutional
controversy."129

         In her scholarship, Judge Ginsburg has approved of the courts changing their
interpretation of the Constitution in light of social and political developments. In this
case, we see that this kind of overt activism similarly infects her judicial writings. The
asserted policy goal of the Ethics in Government Act--curbing "abuses of executive branch
power"13-justifies for Judge Ginsburg turning the structural imperative of separated
powers mandated by the Constitution into a subjective test barring only what judges feel is
"undue displacement of executive branch prerogatives."132 When the Supreme Court
eventually reversed the court of appeals, Justice Antonin Scalia characterized Judge
Ginsburg's position, which the majority had adopted, this way: "The Court has...replaced the
clear constitutional prescription what the executive power belongs to the President with a

"balancing test'...Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be called the
unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court, revealed to an obedient people on a case-by-
case basis."133

         Quite in contrast to Judge Ginsburg's subjective, functional approach to the
separation of powers in In re Sealed Case, in National Federation of Federal Employees v.
Brown13* she took a decidedly more rigid approach. In this case, unions challenged
imposition by the executive branch of a cap on pay increases under a statute authorizing
adjustment of pay rates consistent with the public interest Emphasizing the "structure of
government-the separation of powers-established by the Constitution, Judge Ginsburg
held in this 2-1 decision that the President may not cap pay increases without relying on
congressionally established standards.

         In Walker v. Jones,136 a former congressional employee claimed she had been
discharged because of her gender. The district court dismissed the action and the court of
appeals, Judge Ginsburg writing, reversed. The Constitution gives each house of Congress
authority to determine its own rules of internal governance. As Judge MacKinnon pointed
out in dissent, "subject only to clear constitutional limitations, that power is 'absolute and
beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal.' What this means is that the House has
virtually unquestionable authority to decide what activities constitute internal legislative
matters, and to regulate, manage, or oversee those matters as it sees fit"137 Even so,
Judge Ginsburg, in what the dissent called a "sharp departure from existing law,"138 created
her own categories of activities over which Congress had unfettered control and those which
the courts could regulate.

         In Doe v. Casey,139 a former CIA employee claimed he was improperly dismissed
because he had revealed his homosexuality. The National Security Act allows the CIA
director "in his discretion" to "terminate the employment of any employec.whenever he
shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States."
Judge Ginsburg joined the decision for the plaintiff. The majority created a rule that, quite

contrary to the plain language of the National Security Act, any dismissal must actually be
in the national interest-as measured by the judiciary, of course-rather than that the (HA
director's exercise of discretion be reasonable. As Judge James Buckley pointed out in
dissent: T h e majority[] misreads [the National Security Act] to require that the
dischargc.actually be in the national interest All that the statute prescribes is that the
Director deem it to be. The majority fails to draw the necessary distinction between judicial,
confirmation of the Director's purposc.and that determination's correctness. While a court
may satisfy itself of the former, it may not inquire into the latter."140

         Judge Ginsburg invoked a rigid concept of structural separation of power to rule in
favor of a labor union, adopted a subjective concept of undue displacement to rule in favor
of investigating the executive branch, delved into matters of internal legislative
administration to preserve a claim of gender discrimination, and misread a federal statute
to keep alive a claim of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It appears she
changes jurisprudential stripes in the pursuit of politically correct results.

         In Wright v. Regan,1*1 parents of black children attending public schools in
Memphis, Tennessee, claimed the Internal Revenue Service failed "on a nationwide
basis"142 to confine tax exempt status to private schools that do not discriminate.143 The
district court dismissed the action because the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit

               Under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, schools are exempt from federal income, Social
Security, and unemployment taxes. Contributions to such organizations are tax-deductible. In Green v. Connolly,
330 RSupp. 1150 (D.D.C. 1971), a three-judge district court held that the Internal Revenue Code requires "denial
and elimination of Federal tax exemption forracially discriminatory private schools and of Federal income tax
deductions for contributions tosuch schools.* /<f. at 1156. The Supreme Court summarily affirmed this decision.

properly invoke a court's jurisdiction. In an opinion by Judge Ginsburg, and over a dissent
describing her opinion as "boldly creating new law on the jurisdiction of federal courts"144
and an opinion "to be deplored as a statement of jurisprudential principle,"145 reversed.

         The plaintiffs in this case challenged the granting of tax exempt status to private
schools, yet did not and had no intention of sending their own children to private schools.
As Judge Ginsburg described their position: "The sole injury they claim is the denigration
they suffer as black parents and schoolchildren when their government graces with tax-
exempt status educational institutions in their communities that treat members of their race
as persons of lesser worth....The very act by the IRS of according tax exemption to a school
that discriminates in their vicinity causes immediate injury to them, plaintiffs maintain and
that is the only injury for which they seek redress."146 That is, they challenged government
policy and action in the abstract, absent an application of that action or policy to them or
any deprivation of any legal rights.

     Judge Ginsburg claimed that "as an intermediate court of review, we select from two

divergent lines of Supreme Court decision the one we believe best fits the case before

us.  When the Supreme Court voted 6-2 to reverse Judge Ginsburg,148 it became

clear that she made the wrong choice. The Supreme Court held that a general claim to

have the government act according to the law is not an injury in fact to the cognizable legal

rights of the plaintiffs. Similarly, the Court held that a general claim of stigmatizing injury

because of the presence somewhere of discriminatory government action, without proof that

individuals had been personally discriminated against, is clearly insufficient to establish

standing and, therefore, the court's jurisdiction.

         As the Supreme Court explained, the doctrine of standing is an essential element of
"the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded."149 As

with the separation of powers cases summarized above, this is another example of how

Judge Ginsburg makes her jurisprudence fit her politics.

         In Women's Equity Action League v. Cavazos^0 Judge Ginsburg found that the
Women's Equity Action league had standing to sue the Department of Education for failing
to properly enforce Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which conditions receipt of federal
education funds on the absence of race discrimination. The court of appeals previously
remanded this matter to the district court to decide the standing question in light of the
Supreme Court's decision in Allen v. Wright which reversed Judge Ginsburg's decision in
Wright v. Regan, discussed above. The plaintiffs in Wright had no connection with an
educational institution allegedly engaged in prohibited discrimination; they merely had an
interest in the problem. "The fact that the Alien plaintiffs neither attended nor sought to
attend the private schools in question proved fatal to their claim."131 In contrast, the
plaintiffs in Women's Equity Action League, or those they represented, were actually enrolled
or employed in the educational institutions allegedly engaged in prohibited discrimination.

         In Kurtz v. Baker,*52 an atheist philosophy professor requested permission to offer
remarks during the period at the opening of each daily session of Congress reserved for
prayer. The chaplains of the House and Senate denied the request and Dr. Kurtz brought
suit The district court ruled that he had standing to sue, and the court of appeals reversed.
The court found that Kurtz had established sufficient "injury in fact" by alleging that he had
"been prevented from addressing each house of Congress."133 But the court next decided
that this injury could not be said to have been caused by the chaplains' rejection of Kurtz's
requests because there was no allegation, or any proof, that the chaplains had the authority
to grant those requests. There is, therefore, no "substantial probability"154 that Kurtz
would be allowed to speak but for the chaplains' denial of his request

         Judge Ginsburg dissented on this point, but went out of her way to avoid the
conclusion that Dr. Kurtz lacked standing to raise his claim. She twisted Kurtz's claim into
something that helped her reach her own conclusion, but also into something that his
complaint did not allege. She insisted that "Kurtz's daim...is inevitably an attack on
Congress' customary, opening-with-prayer observance."151 She thus confused the
underlying issue of whether a chaplain-led prayer is constitutional with the real issue of
standing, that is, whether Dr. Kurtz could properly raise the issue. Since the Supreme Court

has held that the practice does not violate the Constitution,**6 she wrote that "I would so

hold directly and would not avoid the question by a circuitous determination that Kurtz
lacks standing to seek its settlement"157

         To the extent that Judge Ginsburg hereby shows a preference for deciding cases on
the merits rather than for first addressing questions-like standing-affecting the court's
jurisdiction, she herself completely refutes any daim of moderation made for her by her
apologists and shows a more aggressive activism than those apologists are willing to admit
To the extent that she confuses the issues of merits and jurisdictions, she evidences an
disturbing lack of ability.

Another example of how Judge Ginsburg stretches the limits of the standing doctrine

to accommodate a political interest with which she has sympathy is Spam v. Colonial Village,
Inc..*5* Individual and organizational plaintiffs brought suit against the manager of a

condominium development which, they claimed, ran discriminatory advertisements in the

Washington Post in violation of the Fair Housing Act The plaintiffs claimed that

advertisements utilizing white models "indicate a preference based race" prohibited by the

Fair Housing Act that "impelled the [plaintiffs] to devote resources to checking or

neutralizing the ads' adverse impact  Such "concrete drains on their time and

resources"TM constitute an injury sufficient, they said, to confer standing to sue.

         In this case, an organization made a subjective judgment about the message being
sent by an advertisement That organization made another subjective judgment about the
need for it to respond to the message it deemed was sent by the advertisement The
organization made yet another subjective judgment about the form its response should take.
It is by no means dear that the condusion reached through such a series of judgments
constitutes the kind of "actual or threatened injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the

alleged illegal action"161 required by the Supreme Court for standing to exist It seems
closer to the "abstract concern with a subject"162 or an "organization's abstract social
interests"163 that remains insufficient to confer standing.

         Similarly, in Action Alliance of Senior Citizens v. HecJder,*6* several organizations
seeking to improve the lives of the elderly through information, counseling, and service
referral brought suit challenging implementation of the Age Discrimination Act by the
Department of Health and Human Services. These organizations challenged the content
of specific regulations and the Department's supposed failure to act on regulations proposed
by other agencies. A federal magistrate concluded that the organizations thereby lacked
standing to bring suit The court of appeals reversed on this point Judge Ginsburg wrote
that there were "concrete organizational interests detrimentally affected"165 that justified
standing in this case. Because two of the challenged regulations-which reduced the level
of compliance reports and eliminated the need for certain types of evaluations-restricted
the flow of infonnation available to organizations that, like the plaintiffs in this case, work
to counsel individuals and otherwise refer them for provision of services, these organizations'
"programmatic concerns" rather than "ideological interests" were affected.166

         The plaintiff organizations were not the subject of the regulations. The regulations
did not operate to affect these organizations in any direct way whatsoever. Rather,
regulations that decrease the amount of bureaucratic activity necessary for service delivery
are said to "inhibit[]...the[] daily operations"167 of organizations that simply deal in
information about the bureaucracy. This creates a completely unwarranted incentive to
constantly expand government bureaucracy through initiation of lawsuits by organizations
which, while not subject to government regulations, nevertheless deal in information about
those government regulations.

         In Public Citizen v. National Highway Traffic Safely Administration,"* environmental
and consumer organizations challenged a rule issued by the NHTSA setting mandatory fuel
economy standards for automobiles. They claimed that their members wished to purchase
more fuel-efficient automobiles and the NHTSA standards were too low. That is,
organizations claimed that the agency should have done something more to their lildng and
the court granted them standing on this ground. This is a striking expansion of the standing
doctrine which opens up the floodgates to litigation by persons whose only interests that are
injured are their policy preferences.

         It does not require more examples to establish the point In case after case where
public interest organizations bring lawsuits, Judge Ginsburg massages and stretches the
standing doctrine to advance politically correct daims-e.g., discrimination and
environmental--to go forward. Perhaps it is merely coincidence that the causes championed
by these groups parallel the liberal political agenda. On the other hand, perhaps Judge
Ginsburg's politics drives her jurisprudence.

                                              F. Civil Rights Cases

         Judge Ginsburg's application of the standing doctrine produces results in curiously
close parallel to the liberal political agenda. Several decisions addressing jurisdictional
issues in civil rights cases produce the same parallel-denying a race discrimination claim to
whites, while allowing another employment discrimination claim as well as environmental
interests to proceed with their suits.

         In Dougherty v. Barry,"9 eight white firefighters claimed race discrimination in the
promotion of black firefighters to the position of deputy fire chief. The district court ruled
for the plaintiffs and ordered back pay and retirement benefits as if each of the eight
plaintiffs had been promoted. The court of appeals vacated that decision, ordering the
complaint dismissed because it was filed more than 90 days after the plaintiffs received the
requisite letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission notifying them of their
right to sue. It made no difference that the EEOC later issued a second right to sue letter
that the plaintiffs thought brought with it another 90-day period in which to sue.

         While construing this time limit rigidly, Judge Ginsburg took a more flexible
approach in Bayer v. U.S. Department of the TreasuryTM in which the plaintiff alleged
discrimination based on religion. The plaintiff failed to contact the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission within 30 days of the alleged discrimination as required by federal
regulations. The district court dismissed the complaint The court of appeals reversed, this
time holding that the plaintiff may have been unaware of the 30-day time limit, thus making
summary judgment for the government inappropriate.

district court dismissed the complaint The plaintiff organization waited more than three
months to file an appeal, outside the 60 days required by the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure. The court of appeals affirmed. Judge Ginsburg dissented, claiming that the
plaintiff was confused about the proper appellate forum. She rejected the majority's

         Mosrie v. Barry173 gave Judge Ginsburg the opportunity to apply Supreme Court
precedent with which she clearly disagreed. In this case, a police officer claimed that his
lateral transfer and public criticism of bis performance by supervisors deprived him of a
liberty interest and entitled him to additional procedural protections that had not been
afforded him. The district court ruled for the government The court of appeals affirmed
because the loss suffered by the plaintiff did not rise to the level required by the Supreme
Court in Paul v. Davis.174 Judge Ginsburg concurred, but wrote separately to harshly
criticize the Supreme Court's decision in Paul. She wrote: "Until the Court revisits the
question whether a person's good name is a liberty interest, protected by the Constitution
against arbitrary government deprivation, we are obliged to follow Paul v. Davis, and its

reasoning in Judge Bork's opinion, but emphasizing penetrating criticism of the High Court's
opinion, I concur."175

         In Afosrie, Judge Ginsburg wrote an opinion separate from Judge Robert Bork's
majority to offer her own critical commentary about a Supreme Court decision. Just one
year later, Judge Ginsburg wrote an opinion separate from Judge Bork's majority to criticize
him for offering "a commentarial exposition of the opinion writer's viewpoint"1116 about
certain Supreme Court decisions. Judge Ginsburg apparently departs from her own rules
about moderation when it suits her political fancy.

         liberal activists and most in the media establishment focus on a tally of winners and
losers and conclude that a judge who rules for the government is bad while a judge who
rules for criminal defendants is good. Under this standard, Judge Ginsburg has a decidedly
mixed record.

         In United States v. Eccleston,"7 a jury convicted Trevor Eccleston of narcotics and
firearms offenses. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the circumstantial evidence
in the case was "just barely sufficient to sustain the verdict"178 She was convinced that
improper admission of hearsay testimony by a police officer prejudiced that testimony and
the district court should have ordered a mistrial.

         In United States v. Russell,119 Charles Russell was convicted of narcotics and
firearms charges. The court of appeals affirmed, upholding warrantless searches where plain
view or the shape or feel of objects justified it and disapproving of a warrantless search of

         In United States v. Harrington?*0 the judge sentencing Kelvin Harrington for
narcotics offenses departed from the federal sentencing guidelines, giving him a more lenient
sentence because Harrington's potential for rehabilitation was a mitigating factor
inadequately considered in the guidelines. Hie court of appeals vacated the decision and
remanded the case for resentencing, disagreeing with the district court's analysis but finding
a niche in the existing guidelines-acceptance of personal responsibility for one's criminal
conduct--for what the court deemed to be Harrington's post-offense rehabilitative conduct
As the dissenting judge observed: "A defendant's participation in a drug treatment program
does not evince his acceptance of responsibility for the crime he committed, even where-as
here-that crime was distributing illegal drugs. Rather, it demonstrates only the defendant's
desire to improve himself...and perhaps to obtain a lighter sentence."181

         In United States v. Chin,182 a jury convicted Andrew Chin of narcotics charges and
of using a juvenile to avoid detection for a drug offense. The court of appeals affirmed,
holding that the police officer had probable cause to arrest Chin and upholding admission
of expert drug testimony. Observing that the federal statute prohibiting the use of juveniles
to avoid detection "is not a model of meticulous drafting,"1 Judge Ginsburg followed the
lead of three other courts of appeals to conclude that actual knowledge of the juvenile's age
is not an element of the crime.

         In United States v. Gibson,16* a jury convicted Bernard Gibson of narcotics charges.
The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, upholding the search of a purse found in a car
and into which a police officer had observed money and a packet of white substance being
placed under both the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and the plain view
doctrine.

         In United States v. WatleyliS a jury convicted Andre Watley of using a firearm
during a drug offense and other narcotics charges. The district court denied a pre-sentence
motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The court of appeals vacated the district court's
decision and remanded, holding that erroneous information about the possible sentence the
defendant would face made his guilty plea involuntary.

         In United States v. Foster?16 a jury convicted Cornell Foster of narcotics charges.
The court of appeals reversed, holding that the trial court erred in limiting defense counsel's
cross-examination of a police officer about the fact that Foster carried, at the time of his
arrest, significantly less cash than would be expected of someone selling drugs. The court
also held it was improper for the prosecutor to insinuate he had knowledge of prior
instances of drug dealing by Foster absent evidence in the record to support the insinuation.

         The reasons discussed above1*7 why Judge Ginsburg's judicial record is less
revealing than it might be are apparent in this criminal context The criminal jurisdiction
of the D.C. Circuit is decidedly limited. As the examples above demonstrate, the criminal
docket is dominated by cases involving violation of federal drug laws. Few, if any, of these
cases raise significant issues.

                                           m. CONCLUSION

         Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a strikingly activist judicial philosophy. While her
scholarly writings and the inherent constraints imposed on a mid-level appellate court may
suggest a more moderate judicial style, her record while on the U.S. Court of Appeals
demonstrates that she abandons even this moderation when it suits her political agenda.
In key categories of cases-e.g., cases involving the separation of powers, abortion, standing,
or discrimination-her politics drives her jurisprudence.

         Considering her own acknowledgement that the factors present on other courts that
tug judges toward moderation are not present on the Supreme Court, this comprehensive
review of Judge Ginsburg's record completely refutes the "moderate" label that so many
journalists, politicians, and activists have rushed to place on her. Her liberal politics and
judicial activism may well dominate her tenure on the Supreme Court to a degree that no
one anticipates, or is willing to admit publicly, today.

         Over fifty years ago, Justice Hugo Black wrote that the Supreme Court "stands against
any winds that blow, as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are
helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public
excitement." That is the standard to which other great Justices strove and reached, and that is
the standard by which Judge Ginsburg will be measured. As a lower court judge, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg has been constrained by the rulings of an increasingly conservative Supreme Court.
However, it is the battles she fought prior to her service on the bench that portend a Justice who
will broker the promises of the Constitution into reality.

BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION

         Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg's lengthy legal career has included public interest advocacy,
teaching law and serving on the federal bench. It has been a career indelibly shaped by her own
confrontations with discrimination. As a young wife in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where her husband
was in the military, she encountered sex bias firsthand working as a Social Security claims
adjuster. After announcing her first pregnancy, she was denied promotions and raises, while a
co-worker who did not reveal her pregnancy remained on the promotional track.

         Two years later, in 1956 Ginsburg entered Harvard Law School, earning a place on the
school's law journal. When her husband found employment in New York, she transferred to
Columbia and graduated tied first in her class in 1959. Despite her academic accomplishments,
such legendary jurists as Justice Felix Frankfurter and Second Circuit Judge Learned Hand
refused to hire her because of her sex, and law firms turned her away. She later said of the
firms, "To be a woman, a Jew and a mother to boot - that combination was a bit too much."
Ginsburg eventually obtained a clerkship with a New York federal judge and later worked for
several years on a Columbia-sponsored comparative law project.

         Passed over for a position at Columbia, New York University and Fordham law schools,
Ginsburg joined the faculty at Rutgers in 1963, primarily teaching courses in civil procedure and
the federal courts. In the late 1960s, at the urging of several women students, she taught a class
on the legal status of women. Her research for the course opened her eyes to the widespread
nature of legalized gender bias. At the same time, she volunteered at the New Jersey chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union and was referred cases of women complaining of sex
discrimination. Later Ginsburg said, "It was that combination - research in the lawbooks and
confrontation with the genuine grievances of women who had been denied jobs or other
opportunities -- mat combination engaged my interest both as an attorney and as a woman." In
one case, she successfully challenged school board regulations forcing pregnant teachers to leave
without the right to return to their jobs.

         Leaving Rutgers to become the first female law professor at Columbia, Ginsburg was
well on her way to establishing herself as an expert in gender discrimination law. The ACLU
set up the Women's Rights Project, and Ginsburg became its first director. The Project was
soon recognized as the premier women's rights advocate before the Supreme Court. Between
1969 and 1980, Ginsburg argued six landmark sex discrimination cases before the Court and
won five. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. Senator Strom Thurmond was the only Senator to oppose her.

As AN ADVOCATE

         As an advocate and teacher, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of the premier authorities on
gender equality under the Constitution and virtually steered the Supreme Court to its current
jurisprudence on the subject. Although the 14th Amendment guarantees that the government
shall not "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws," the Court
historically had interpreted the clause not to apply to women and consistently upheld gender-
based classifications. A woman could be barred from the legal profession (1873); had no right
to vote (1875); could not work as a bartender (1948); and could be barred from serving on a
jury (1961). According to Ginsburg, for women seeking justice before the Court during this
period, the Constitution was "an empty cupboard." "Sexual Equality under the Fourteenth and
Equal Rights Amendment," 1979 Washington University Law Quarterly 164.

         By the late 1960s, however, the phenomenal changes in women's participation in society
and in the labor force demanded a reassessment of stereotypical notions about women's roles and
a closer examination of gender-based laws. Sensing that die Supreme Court was open to hearing
fresh arguments, Ginsburg pursued a legal strategy to both inform the Court of these new facts
and to persuade it to extend the umbrella of equal protection guarantees to women. Part of that
strategy was to select cases in which the inequities fell on men as well. By the end of the
1970s, the ACLU had participated in more than half of the 63 gender bias cases before the
Court, and Ginsburg had been the principal author of most of the briefs.

         In her first brief to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg launched a full-scale attack on a gender
discriminatory law in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), which involved an Idaho statute giving
men preference over women for appointment as estate administrators. According to the Court's
equal protection jurisprudence at the time, gender-based classifications were routinely upheld if
they were rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. Under this approach known
as the "rational basis" test, little scrutiny was involved.

         Ginsburg argued in Reed, however, that the law should be viewed as inherently suspect,
similar to way the Court analyzed race-based classifications. Under this approach, a law treating
people differently had to have a compelling purpose, and the classification had to be necessary to
accomplish that purpose if the law was to survive the Court's "strict scrutiny." The Court was
unwilling to designate gender as a suspect category, but it did agree that the law was based on
overgeneralized and outdated notions of women's abilities. It unanimously invalidated the statute
using the rational basis standard, but added that the law was "subject to scrutiny." Reed marked
the Court's first decision ever striking down a gender-based law as unconstitutional.

         In subsequent cases, Ginsburg continued to press the argument that gender was a suspect
classification and that Reed stood for the proposition that administrative convenience alone could
not justify gender classification. Her position found four votes on the Court in Frontiero v.
Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), but fell short of the majority necessary for establishing a
precedent. Nonetheless, eight Justices held that married women in the armed services were
entitled to the same fringe benefits as married men. Justice Byron White was part of the
"gender as suspect" plurality, while Justice William Rehnquist was the lone dissenter.

                      666

         Two cases brought by other advocates interrupted the chain of precedents sought by
Ginsburg and eliminated any hope of obtaining a majority on the Court for treating gender as a
suspect classification. Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974), brought by the Florida ACLU
chapter but argued by Ginsburg before the Court, upheld a state real-property tax exemption for
widows and blind and disabled persons, but not widowers. Rejecting a widower's challenge, the
Court observed that the tax scheme was benign and intended to assist surviving wives facing
unplanned economic difficulties. The Court upheld a similarly "benign" system in Schlesinger v.
Bollard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975) (no equal protection violation to give female naval officer longer
time period before mandatory discharge for lack of promotion). To Ginsburg, Kahn and Bollard
reflected the outmoded thinking underlying earlier decisions that women were in need of a
"boost. . . because they cannot make it on their own." "Remarks on Women Becoming Part of
the Constitution," 6 Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice 25 (1988).

         After the Kahn and Bollard setbacks, Ginsburg adjusted her constitutional arguments in
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), urging the Court to adopt an intermediate level
of scrutiny. In Wiesenfeld, a widower claimed discrimination because of a Social Security
provision that denied him "mother's insurance benefits," which would have allowed him to
remain at home to take care of his infant son; his wife had died during childbirth. The statute
allowed widows with dependent children to receive such benefits. Ginsburg argued that the
statute actually discriminated against each member of the family. It denied benefits to widowers
which a similarly situated widow would have received. The law also provided less protection
for female wage earners by treating them equally with men for purposes of Social Security
taxation, but unequally in a determination of family benefits. In addition, the law denied the
motherless child the same opportunity for parental care afforded to a fatherless child. Brief for
Appellee at 10-12, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld. Seven Justices agreed, stating that a purportedly
benign classification was still subject to judicial scrutiny. Without saying so, the Court looked
closer at the provision than a rational basis test would have required.

         In Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), the Court finally adopted the standard of review
pushed by Ginsburg. Ironically, the case was not brought by the ACLU or Ginsburg, but by a
private attorney who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. However, Ginsburg authored an
amicus brief and advised the attorney on legal arguments. She specifically called his attention to
the uselessness of urging strict scrutiny and counseled him to argue instead for an intermediate
level of scrutiny. The Court, 7-2 (with Justice Rehnquist in dissent), declared that any gender-
based law, to withstand challenge, must serve important governmental objectives and must be
substantially related to achievement of those objectives. The law at issue allowed 18-year-old
girls to purchase 3.2 percent alcoholic beer, whereas boys had to wait until age 21. The Court
stated that the law did little to cope with the problem of drunk driving by young people.

         The same day as Craig was heard, Ginsburg argued Goldfarb v. Califano, 430 U.S. 199
(1977). In Goldfarb, five Justices voted to strike down a Social Security provision authorizing
survivor's benefits to widowers only if the wife's contributions to family expenses had been
three times that of the husband's, whereas no such formula was tied to a widow's eligibility.
Ginsburg argued that although the law appeared to harm only men, as the law in Craig seemed
to harm only boys, it actually hurt women by using gender as a short-hand method for drawing
lines, which only reinforced stereotypes.

         Looking back on the gender equality cases of the 1970s, Ginsburg wrote that they
illustrated "the kind of interplay among the people, the political branches, and the courts that has
kept the 'more perfect Union,' ordained by the Constitution alive and vibrant over these 200
years." 6 Law and Inequality at 25. In a more recent speech, she added that by forcing
legislatures to reexamine gender-based laws, "the Court helped to ensure that laws and
regulations would 'catch up with a changed world.'" "Speaking in a Judicial Voice," Madison
Lecture, New York University School of Law (March 9, 1993), 3rd line draft at 58 [hereinafter
Madison Lecture]. As an advocate, Ginsburg was a critical participant in the Court's dialogue
about the role of women in society and their status in the law, and awakened the Court's
conscience about the meaning of equality.

As A JUDGE

             THE ROLE OF AN APPEALS COURT JUDGE

         Courtwatchers predict that Judge Ginsburg will be as "moderate" on the Supreme Court
as she has been on the D.C. Circuit. But such predictions are at best premature. Her judicial
record and extrajudicial writings, taken together, indicate that she may view the role of a
Supreme Court Justice quite differently from that of an appellate court judge. Frequently, Judge
Ginsburg has noted the limitations circuit judges face. They "generally have, if not marching
instructions, then at least some pathmarkers from the appeals courts on which they sit, sister
courts, or the Supreme Court, and they do not have the last judicial word on the turbulent
constitutional questions of the day." "Confirming Supreme Court Justices: Thoughts on the
Second Opinion Rendered by the Senate," 1988 University of Illinois Law Review 111.

         In a 1985 speech, Judge Ginsburg summed up the role of federal courts of appeals judges
with the statement H[o]ur modus operandi gravitates toward the middle." "The Obligation to
Reason Why," 37 University of Florida Law Review 212 (Spring 1985). It is a statement as true
of herself as of any circuit judge. For nearly thirteen years on the bench, Judge Ginsburg has
employed a "middle of the road" approach to decisionmaking that has earned her the reputation
of "centrist" on a court known for its conservative and liberal jurists.

         Judge Ginsburg's judicial approach on the D.C. Circuit appears to stem from her strong
commitment to the institutional integrity of the federal courts and the unique role of an appeals
court judge. She believes strongly that one of the judiciary's primary roles is to promote
predictability and consistency within the law. She has written frequently of the distinction
between individualist and institutionally-minded styles of judging, exhibiting a pronounced
preference for the latter. Judge Ginsburg argues that collegiality through unanimity of opinion is
critical to promoting and enhancing the rule of law. While writing separately is sometimes
productive, even necessary, she argues that "overindulgence in individualistic judging" can
diminish the force of judicial opinions and undermine legal authority. "Styles of Collegial
Judging: One Judge's Perspective," 39 Federal Bar News <fcJournal 200 (March/April 1992).

         Judge Ginsburg's appellate decisions are also marked by an overriding fidelity to the
proper role of the appeals courts as the middle tier of the federal court system. She has written:

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judgt Ruth Badw Ginsburg  Page 5
                                     668

                   "One reality [about the courts of appeals] cannot be over-
                   emphasized: the character of the cases combines with the modus
                   operandi to tug judges strongly toward the middle, toward
                   moderation and away from startlingly creative or excessively rigid
                   positions. . . . Unlike the Supreme Court, courts of appeals deal far
                   less frequently with grand constitutional questions than with
                   questions of statutory interpretation or the rationality of agency or
                   district court decisions. In most matters of that variety, as Justice
                   Brandeis repeatedly cautions: '[I]t is more important that the
                   applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right . . . . ' "

                   ". . . . In contrast to district judges, who are the real power holders
                   in the federal court system, no single court of appeals judge can
                   carry the day in any case. To attract a second vote and establish
                   durable law for the Circuit, a judge may find it necessary to
                   moderate his or her own position, sometimes to be less bold, other
                   times to be less clear."

             A COMPLEX RECORD

         Judge Ginsburg's strong respect for the courts' institutional integrity, and particularly the
distinct role of appellate judges, pervades her judicial opinions, which exhibit a strict adherence
to legal precedent and a cautious, often formalistic approach to deciding cases. Her opinions are
generally as narrowly tailored to the specific facts of a case as possible, reflecting her sense that
intermediate appellate judges should refrain from expansive decisions that produce sweeping
changes in the law. On a court considered second in importance only to the Supreme Court
because of its many high-profile and contentious decisions on the scope of federal power, Judge
Ginsburg has often declined to subscribe to the bold positions of some of her colleagues.

         Although routinely labeled a centrist, Judge Ginsburg has actually built a judicial record
that defies precise characterization. Studies show that she votes more often with her colleagues
appointed by Reagan and Bush than her fellow Carter appointees, and she is reputed to be on the
"conservative" side on business law issues. According to one study, her decisions in antitrust
law "have been as consistently conservative as any Carter, Bush, or Reagan judge on theD.C.
Circuit." William Kovacic,"Reagan's Judicial Appointees and Antitrust in the 1990s," 60
Fordham Law Review 122 (1991). In a 1989 case, however, she dissented from the court's
approval of a joint operating agreement between two major newspapers, which operated to
exempt the arrangement from antitrust laws, and joined her Carter-appointed colleagues in
calling for a rehearing before the full court. Michigan Gtizensfor an Independent Press v.
Thomburgh, 868 F.2d 1285 (D.C. Cir. 1989), reh'g en bane denied, 868 F.2d 1300 (1989).
Moreover, her opinions in the critical areas of standing and constitutional law, while generally
exhibiting her characteristically cautious, methodical approach to decisionmaking, suggest an
appreciation for the Constitution's unique role in protecting individual rights.

         Access to the Courts

         On issues relating to access to the courts --often viewed as a barometer of whether a
jurist possesses a restrictive or expansive judicial philosophy --Judge Ginsburg displays a broad
legal vision. For example, in Wright v. Regan, 656 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1981), she held that
parents of black children attending public schools had standing to challenge the Internal Revenue
Service's failure to deny, as legally required, tax exempt status to private schools that
discriminated on the basis of race. The Supreme Court later overturned the decision in Allen v.
Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1983) in an opinion reflective of its increasing antipathy to the doctrine
of standing. The Court concluded that the harm alleged was not fairly traceable to the IRS's
supposed inaction.

         In another prominent case, Women's Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 879 F.2d 880
(D.C. Cir. 1989), Judge Ginsburg held that students had standing to sue for enforcement of
federal laws prohibiting federal funding of discriminatory educational institutions. She
distinguished Allen v. Wright, holding that the plaintiffs in the present case (students rather than
parents) suffered a direct injury and that federal funding of racially discriminatory institutions "is
in part causative of the perpetuation of such discrimination." But Judge Ginsburg dismissed the
case on other grounds in a later decision, 906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990), holding that Congress
did not create a right, under the civil right statutes, for the plaintiffs to maintain such a broad
and continuing action for compliance - the scale of which she repeatedly emphasized -- in light
of several precedents that had been handed down since the litigation began in 1970.

         Generally, Judge Ginsburg's opinions on standing exhibit a receptiveness to arguments of
how an injury is traceable to or caused by government action or inaction -- a requirement for
standing -- especially when the claim is distinctly outlined and arises under a law passed by
Congress. In Dellums v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 863 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. 1988), an
anti-apartheid organization and its director-activist contended that a license allowing the importa-
tion of uranium from South Africa violated the Anti-Apartheid Act's trade embargo against the
country. Judge Laurence Silberman held that the petitioners' injury -- their inability to travel to
South Africa -- was not caused by the license nor could it be redressed by revoking it. In
dissent, Judge Ginsburg argued that the license could conceivably contribute to the preservation
of apartheid, the cause of the petitioners' injuries. Urging the court to defer to Congress'
judgment that sanctions against South Africa were an effective means to end apartheid, she
criticized the majority's approach as placing "judges beyond the pale of their general competence
and draw[ing] the bench into the unseemly business of second-guessing Congress."

         The same openness to organizational standing and deference to Congressional findings
was evident in Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (fair housing
organization had standing to challenge discriminatory newspaper advertisements under federal
law and plaintiffs sought to vindicate values "endorsed by Congress . . . the enforcement of
which Congress specifically left in the hands of private attorneys general like plaintiffs") and
United Transportation Union v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 891 F.2d 908, 921 (D.C. Cir.
1989) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (union did not have standing to contest agency rule but
"Congressional economic and social judgments bearing on standing merit . . . respect").

                      670

         Judge Ginsburg also found standing in National Coal Association v. Lujan, 979 F.2d
1548 (D.C. Cir. 1992), in which several coal associations challenged civil penalty regulations
promulgated under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. She rejected the argument
that the regulations applied only to individuals and thus not to the association members, which
were coal companies. In addition, she held that a union had standing to sue the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, a receiver for a failed bank, in order to enforce the compensation rights
of employees arising from a bargaining agreement between the union and the bank. She noted
that although the union itself did not have a claim against the bank, it generally had authority to
sue on behalf of its members and nothing in the controlling federal law, the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, warranted a different conclusion. Office & Profes-
sional Employees International Union v. FDIC, 962 F.2d 63 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

         Civ/7 Rights and Civil Liberties

         Judge Ginsburg appears to take a fairly broad view of the scope of civil rights
protections. In Goodrich v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 712 F.2d 1488
(D.C. Cir. 1983), she allowed a trial to go forward on the issue of whether the union violated
the Equal Pay Act when it paid the female plaintiff less than it paid its male employees. In
O'Donnell Construction Company v. District of Columbia, 963 F.2d 420 (D.C. Cir. 1992),
Judge Ginsburg concurred in striking down the District's minority business contractor set-aside
program, relying on a recent Supreme Court decision, City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,
488 U.S. 469 (1989), which held that such a program must rest on a strong body of evidence
showing racial discrimination in the past and be narrowly tailored to remedy such bias.
However, Judge Ginsburg emphasized the limits of Croson, stating that "minority preference
programs are not per se offensive to equal protection principles, nor need they be confined
solely to the redress of state-sponsored discrimination," and that they are not exclusively
remedies for past wrongs. 963 F.2d at 429.

         Her approach in the area of civil liberties is less consistent. When the government treads
heavily on a firmly established right, such as the free exercise of religion or speech, Judge
Ginsburg shows no reluctance to criticize the action. In Goldman v. Secretary of Defense, 739
F.2d 657 (D.C. Cir. 1984), she dissented from the court's decision not to rehear a case
involving a Jewish military officer's right under the First Amendment to wear a yarmulke while
on duty. She wrote:

                   "The p l a i n t i f f . . . has long served his country as an Air Force
                  officer with honor and devotion. A military commander has now
                  declared intolerable the yarmulke Dr. Goldman has worn without
                  incident throughout his several years of military service. At the
                  least, the declaration suggests 'callous indifference' to Dr.
                   Goldman's religious faith, and it runs counter to 'the best of our
                  traditions' to accommodateQ the public service to theQ spiritual
                   needs [of our people.]"

739 F.2d at 660 (citations omitted). Similarly, Judge Ginsburg argued in dissent in DKT
Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development, 887 F.2d 275 (D.C. Cir. 1989) that a

Alliance for Justice  Rtport on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Page 8
                      671

government agency violated the First Amendment free speech and association rights of domestic
family planning organizations by conditioning funding to foreign groups on their not accepting
private, abortion-related funds from domestic organizations.

         Judge Ginsburg has also shown an openness to certain judicial remedies to correct
government malfeasance when civil liberties are at stake. In an Eighth Amendment "cruel and
unusual punishment" case, a two-judge majority lifted a court-imposed population cap at an
overcrowded prison, stating that "courts are not in the business of running prisons." Inmates of
Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 841 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The dissenting judge noted, however,
that even the government's own experts had described the prison conditions as "both deplorable
and explosive." 844 F.2d at 846. On suggestion for rehearing en bane, Judge Ginsburg joined
a minority of her colleagues in seeking to review the case and wrote separately to underscore the
appropriateness of a population cap as a possible remedy. 850 F.2d 796, 800 (D.C. Cir. 1988)
(dissent from denial of rehearing en bane).

         But Judge Ginsburg has also criticized the remedial effects of Roe v. Wade as too
sweeping. In her Madison lecture, she argued that by relying on the right to privacy to
recognize a woman's right to abortion, the Court effectively struck down every state abortion
law and exacerbated the national debate over the issue. Although an abortion rights supporter,
Judge Ginsburg stated that the Court could have found a firmer Constitutional ground, such as
the equal protection clause, on which to rest its decision. Instead of constructing the trimester
analytical framework, she asserted that the Court should have simply invalidated the law at issue
and allowed states to gradually test the limits of the abortion right. Several commentators have
disagreed with her historical rendition of the facts surrounding the pro-choice movement at the
time Roe was decided and have pointed out the real-life implications for women who could not
wait for the courts to delineate the scope of the abortion right.

         In another civil liberties case, Judge Ginsburg was reluctant to look closer at a Supreme
Court precedent that displayed an unusual harshness towards gays and lesbians. In Dronenburg
v. Zech, 746 F.2d 1579 (D.C. Cir. 1984), a three-judge panel, comprised of Judges Robert
Bork, Antonin Scalia, and a district judge sitting by designation, rejected a sailor's claim that the
Navy's policy of discharging individuals who engage in homosexual conduct violated the
constitutional right to privacy. Judge Bork's opinion was sweeping in its criticism of the right to
privacy. Four members of the full court voted to rehear the case, arguing that the panel's
expansive decision inappropriately "conducted] a general spring cleaning of constitutional law"
in finding no right to privacy.

         Although Judge Ginsburg rejected Judge Bork's discussion as primarily non-binding dicta,
she voted not to rehear the case, arguing that a 1976 Supreme Court case squarely controlled the
instant one. In that case, the High Court affirmed without opinion a district court judgment
upholding a statute barring homosexual conduct between consenting adults. Her reliance on that
lone, summarily-decided case to reject an important and novel constitutional question led the
four judges voting to rehear the case to lament her "well-intentioned" but unconvincing "attempt
to justify the panel decision." 746 F.2d at 1580-81. They asserted that the Court had "not
definitively answered the difficult question." 746 F.2d at 1580 (quoting from New York v.
Uplinger, 104 S.Ct. 2332 (1984)).

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Page 9
                      672

         In criminal law cases, Judge Ginsburg has written few opinions herself but hasjoined in
at least three decisions that restricted the rights of the criminally accused. In United States v.
Jones, No. 91-3025, slip op. (D.C. Cir. July 2, 1993), Judge Ginsburg joined an en bane
opinion holding that a defendant could receive a longer sentence under the sentencing guidelines
if he or she, rather than pleading guilty, chooses to go to trial and is subsequently convicted.
The dissenters, Judges Abner Mikva, Patricia Wald, Harry Edwards and David Sentelle, argued
that the majority was penalizing the defendant for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to trial.

         In a Fourth Amendment case, United States v. Rodney, 956 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1992),
Judge Ginsburg joined then-Circuit Judge Clarence Thomas's opinion allowing a consensual
body search to include the individual's crotch area. Although recognizing that a consensual
search cannot exceed the scope of the consent, Judge Thomas nonetheless held that the search at
issue, which was conducted on a public street and on less than articulable suspicion of wrong-
doing, "reasonably" included the person's genitals. Dissenting, Judge Wald argued that a citizen
on a public thoroughfare who consents to a body search certainly does not expect the search to
include his or her most private body parts.

         In another troubling consensual-search case, Judge Ginsburg joined an opinion by Judge
Douglas H. Ginsburg upholding a search of a train passenger's baggage after the person
withdrew his consent to the search. In United States v. Carter, 985 F.2d 1095 (D.C.Cir.
1993), a plainclothes officer approached a nervous-looking train passenger and received
permission to search his bag. When the officer pulled out a separate paper bag, however, the
passenger snatched it back, replying that there was food in it and that he would get it out
himself. He then put his hand into the bag, retrieved nothing but refused to allow the officer to
look inside. The officer then seized the bag, which was ultimately found to contain drugs.
Judge D.H. Ginsburg held that the "totality of the circumstances," including the manner in
which the passenger withdrew his consent, justified the seizure.

         In dissent, Judge Wald essentially argued that the way the defendant exercised his
Constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches was used to justify exactly the kind of
intrusion the Fourth Amendment was seeking to prevent. She explained, "The reality is that so-
called consensual encounters with the police are bound to be unnerving, and that most citizens --
innocent or guilty -- will feel the need to explain or excuse themselves when refusing to comply
with a police request to search their luggage . . . and, in so doing, create the very suspicion that
will be used to justify the previously unauthorized detention. . . .Permitting the police to rely on
the atmospherics of the refusal . . . strips the legal right of withdrawal of all practical value."
985F.2dat 1100.

             SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF GINSBURG'S OPINIONS

         Judge Ginsburg's opinions in cases reaching the Supreme Court offer several clues about
the kind of Supreme Court Justice she will be. The Court has considered twenty-two D.C.
Circuit court decisions in which Judge Ginsburg wrote either a majority or separate opinion.
Her reversal-affirmance ratio is roughly even -- thirteen to nine -- with a rash of reversals
occurring during her early years. Overall, the Court disagreed with her positions most often in
cases involving standing and constitutional issues, with Judge Ginsburg often taking a more

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Page 10
                                    673

expansive view. Additionally, in administrative law cases, a staple of the D.C. Circuit, Judge
Ginsburg has been less deferential to agencies than the Court and more willing to overturn their
actions on the grounds that are contrary to the intent of Congress or based on inadequate facts.

         Contrasting Judge Ginsburg's voting record on the same cases with that of Justice White
also provides a glimpse into how the Supreme Court may change with her appointment. The
two jurists voted similarly in eight cases and differently in ten (four Court decisions did not list
the Justices' votes or Justice White did not participate). In six cases on which they disagreed,
the Supreme Court and Justice White took a more deferential view of agency decisions. In two
others, Justice White voted to deny standing to plaintiffs, indicating a more limited view than
Judge Ginsburg on access issues. Finally, in a First Amendment free speech case, Justice White
allowed greater restrictions on expressive conduct. See Appendix for a chronological summary
of Judge Ginsburg's decisions reviewed by the Court.

CONCLUSION: A S A JUSTICE

         The appointment of every Justice is an event charged with far-reaching consequences. In
the next century, the Court will be called upon to decide novel issues testing our nation's
character and commitment to its founding principles. It will, for example, be asked to define
"equality" in a culture increasingly fractured along racial and ethnic lines. It will be pressed to
explain the phrase "freedom of expression" in a world in which technological advances occur
almost daily. And it will be asked to articulate what "liberty" and "justice" mean at a time when
currently popular groups and ideas demand conformity and obedience. The nation needs a
judicial visionary who can apply the basic principles of the Constitution to the complex and
unforeseen challenges of the future.

         Throughout Ruth Bader Ginsburg's advocacy, writings, speeches and opinions, what
comes through is her desire to calibrate the dynamic nature of the law and to search for
responses that inch the law forward. To her, this self-described "measured" approach is
essential to maintain collegiality within the judiciary and an open, productive dialogue with the
other branches of government. However, there will be times when much more is required on
the Supreme Court, often the last refuge for those seeking a safe harbor from prejudice and
injustice. Indeed, Justices must display unyielding fidelity to the Constitution at precisely those
moments when the easiest and least controversial action is to acquiesce to the will of the
majority. The true measure of Judge Ginsburg's words will be whether she uses her authority
to shield the disenfranchised and those most in need of the Court's protection.

                      JUDGE RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S D.C. CIRCUIT COURT DECISIONS

                                           REVIEWED BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

Washington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of State, 647 F.2d 197 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (per curiam).
The court held that a Freedom of Information Act exemption which prevents disclosure of
"personnel and medical files and similar files . . . which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy" did not apply to a newspaper's request for records to determine
whether two individuals residing in Iran were U.S. citizens or held U.S. passports. The court
reasoned that citizenship information did not involve intimate details similar to personnel and
medical data. The Supreme Court reversed in U.S. Dep't of State v. Washington Post Co., 456
U.S. 595 (1982), holding that the exemption was intended to protect the confidentiality of
personal matters and that "[i]t strains the normal meaning of the word to say that [passport] files
are not 'similar' to personnel and medical files." Justice White voted with the majority.

United States v. Ross, 655 F.2d 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (en bane). Judge Ginsburg ruled that a
legal, warrantless search of an automobile does not necessarily extend to closed containers found
in the car. The Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant be obtained before a search of such
containers may take place. The Supreme Court reversed in United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798
(1982). In a dissenting opinion, Justice White would have affirmed Judge Ginsburg.

Wright v. Regan, 656 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Judge Ginsburg wrote for the court that
parents of black children in public schools could sue the IRS for providing tax exemptions to
private schools discriminating on the basis of race. The Supreme Court reversed in Allen v.
Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), holding that plaintiffs had suffered no injury because they did not
wish to attend the discriminatory schools. Justice White voted with the majority.

International Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Federal Election Commission,
678 F.2d 1092 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (en bane) (per curiam). The court rejected a union's First
Amendment challenge to various provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act which allowed
corporate political action committees to solicit their career employees and to use general
corporate assets to finance their operating and administrative costs. The union claimed that the
Act violated the Constitution by creating an imbalance of political speech rights between
corporations and unions, prevented career employees from abstaining from political expression,
and, by using corporate assets, violated the speech rights of dissenting shareholders. The
Supreme Court affirmed without opinion in International Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace
Workers v. Federal Election Commission, 459 U.S. 983 (1982). Justice White's position was
not stated.

American Electric Power Service Corp. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 675 F.2d
1226 (D.C. 1982) (denial of rehearing en bane) (per curiam memorandum). The court
invalidated two agency rules issued under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that were
designed to encourage the development of private, small electrical cogenerators and reduce

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg     Page 12
                      675

demand for fossil fuels. The court held that FERC had failed to explain and justify its rule
setting prices for utilities to purchase excess power from the cogenerators and had overstepped
its authority in mandating that utilities establish interconnecting cables with cogenerators. In a
per curiam memorandum denying hearing before the full court, Judge Ginsburg chastised FERC
for "readftng] into the opinion much more than the court put there." The Supreme Court
reversed in American Paper Institute, Inc. v. American Electric Power Service Corp., 461 U.S.
402 (1983). Justice White voted with the majority.

Natural Resources Defense Council v. Gorsuch, 685 F.2d 718 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Judge
Ginsburg held that the Environmental Protection Agency was barred from interpreting pollution
"source" under the Clean Air Act as more than a single originator of pollution. She ruled that
the redefinition of pollution source, which weakened environmental standards, subverted
Congress' intent to improve air quality. The Court reversed in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Justice White voted with the majority.

Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Watt, 703 F.2d 586 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (en bane).
The court held that homeless demonstrators given permission by the National Park Service to
erect tents as part of an around-the-clock demonstration on the Mall and in Lafayette Park had a
First Amendment right to sleep in those tents. Concurring, Judge Ginsburg emphasized that
sleep, like other non-verbal activities, could have both expressive and non-expressive aspects,
and she criticized then-Judge Scalia's dissent narrowly interpreting protected speech to include
only actual words. Judge Ginsburg also asserted that sleeping in this case facilitated actual
speech by allowing the demonstrators to carry on a 24-hour protest. Justice White wrote the
majority opinion to reverse in Clark v. CCNV, 468 U.S. 288 (1984), finding that the ban on
sleeping was a legitimate restriction.

Goldman v. Secretary of Defense, 739 F.2d 657 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (denial of reh'g en bane).
The court rejected a Jewish officer's First Amendment challenge to a military regulation banning
the wearing of "headgear . . . indoors," including a yarmulke. Judge Ginsburg dissented from
the decision not to have the full court rehear the case. The Court, 5 to 4, affirmed in Goldman
v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503 (1986). Justice White voted with the majority.

Schor v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 740 F.2d 1262 (1984). Writing for the
court, Judge Ginsburg held that under the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission did not
have jurisdiction over state law counterclaims arising out of a commodity dispute. She wrote
that Congress did not clearly express an intention to authorize such jurisdiction. The Supreme
Court vacated the decision in Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 473 U.S. 922-
23 (1985), and remanded for further consideration in light of an intervening High Court
decision. Justice White's position was not stated. On remand, the appeals court in a per curiam
opinion with Judge Ginsburg participating, reinstated its original decision. The Supreme Court
reversed in Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986). Justice
White voted with the majority.

Shaw v. Library of Congress, 747 F.2d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The court upheld an attorneys
fees award that took into account inflation due to a delay in payment. Dissenting, Judge
Ginsburg rejected the majority's view that the United States had waived its immunity from

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Pag 13
                      676

interest awards. She would have remanded to the district court, however, for determination of
whether an increase was justified as a permissible "delay" factor rather than as interest. In
Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310 (1985), the Supreme Court reversed, agreeing with
Judge Ginsburg that the United States had not waived its interest immunity, but rejecting the
distinction between interest and a "delay" factor, claiming that they are both "designed to
compensate for the belated receipt of money." Justice White voted with the majority.

Alaska Airlines v. Donovan, 766 F.2d 1550 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Judge Ginsburg concurred with
the court's judgment that the Airline Deregulation Act's unconstitutional legislative veto
provision was severable from the rest of the employee protection provisions of the statute. The
Court affirmed in Alaska Airlines v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678 (1987). Justice White voted to affirm
in the unanimous opinion.

Abourezk v. Reagan, 785 F.2d 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Judge Ginsburg held that the State
Department may deny visas to individuals only when they enter the country "to engage in
activities . . . prejudicial" to U.S. interests and that individuals may not be barred solely because
of their membership in a Communist or anarchist organization. Dissenting, Judge Bork argued
that excluding aliens is an essential act of sovereignty for which the executive branch should be
given wide discretion. An equally divided Supreme Court affirmed without opinion in Reagan v.
Abourezk, 484 U.S. 1 (1987). Justice White's position was not stated.

In re American Federation of Government Employees, 790 F.2d 116 (D.C. Cir. 1986). A
government employees association petitioned for a court order to force the Federal Labor
Relations Authority to process a number of long-standing labor complaints pending before the
agency. Writing for the court, Judge Ginsburg noted that the "FLRA's past record of delay, as
documented by AFGE, was indeed intolerable." However, she noted that because FLRA's
counsel at oral argument produced evidence that the agency was making progress, denial of the
request for a court order was appropriate. Judge Ginsburg left open the option that if the agency
"fail[s] to act with due diligence" on its case docket, the association could renew its petition.
The Supreme Court affirmed without opinion in Bowsher v. American Federation of Government
Employees, 479 U.S. 801 (1986). Justice White's position was not stated.

McKelvey v. Turnage, 792 F.2d 194 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The appeals court rejected a claim that
a Veterans Administration regulation violated the Rehabilitation Act by deeming all alcoholism,
except when secondary to an "acquired psychiatric disorder," to be caused by "willful
misconduct." Under VA rules, a determination of willful misconduct precluded a veteran from
receiving extended educational benefits. Dissenting, Judge Ginsburg argued that an irrebuttable
presumption that alcoholism was always the result of willful misconduct violated the
Rehabilitation Act's proscription against discrimination based solely on handicap. Justice White
wrote for the Court to uphold the VA rule in Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535 (1988).

Hohri v. United States, 793 F.2d 313 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (denial of rehearing en bane).
Japanese-Americans who were interned by the federal government during World War II sued the
United States for damages and other relief under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Little
Tucker Act. The Little Tucker Act limits jurisdiction in district courts over nontort claims to no
more than $10,000; any case over $10,000 must be filed in the Claims Court and is appealable

Alliance for Justice  Report on the Nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Page 14
                      677

to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Upon dismissal by the district court, the appeals court
reversed, holding that the Little Tucker claims fell within the D.C. Circuit jurisdiction, not the
Federal Circuit's, and that the FTCA claims were not time-barred. On a request for a rehearing
before the full court, Judges Skelly Wright and Ginsburg defended the panel decision interpreting
the jurisdictional issue. The Supreme Court reversed in United States v. Hohri, 482 U.S. 64
(1987), holding that the Federal Circuit had exclusive jurisdiction. Justice White joined the
unanimous opinion.

Doe v. Casey, 796 F.2d 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1986). A majority of the court held that a decision to
fire a gay CIA employee is not totally within the director's discretion; judicial review of such a
termination is available under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the court can review
claims raising constitutional issues. Concurring, Judge Ginsburg responded to the dissent by
emphasizing that if the CIA director is required to act within statutory bounds, then surely the
director must comply with the Constitution, the "nation's highest law." The Supreme Court
reversed on the APA issue, but affirmed on the latter in Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988).
Justice White voted with the majority.

In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 829 F.2d 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Following the downing of a
Korean airliner by Soviets over the Sea of Japan, several wrongful death lawsuits were filed in
various districts and then transferred and consolidated for pretrial proceedings in District of
Columbia federal court. Judge Ginsburg held that failure of the airline to give required notice of
liability limitations under the Warsaw Convention and Montreal Agreement did not deprive the
airline of the $75,000-per-passenger limitation on damages. The Supreme Court affirmed in
Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U.S. 122 (1989). Justice White voted with the majority.

In re Sealed Case, 838 F.2d 476 (D.C. Cir. 1988). A majority of the court held the
independent counsel law unconstitutional under the doctrine of separation of powers. Dissenting,
Judge Ginsburg argued that Congress has broad power under the Constitution to grant the power
to appoint "inferior officers" as it sees fit. The Supreme Court reversed in Morrison v. Olson,
487 U.S. 654 (1988), on essentially similar grounds as Judge Ginsburg's opinion. Justice White
voted with the majority.

Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 846 F.2d 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Judge
Ginsburg held that a sculptor who created a statue for display by a nonprofit association was not
an employee of the association but an independent contractor and could apply for copyright
ownership. However, she also ruled that the association might qualify as a joint author and thus
as co-copyright owner of the sculpture. The Supreme Court affirmed in CCNV v. Reid, 490
U.S. 730 (1989). Justice White joined the unanimous opinion.

Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press v. Thornburgh, 868 F.2d 1285 (D.C. Cir. 1989).
A majority of the court upheld the Attorney General's approval, under the Newspaper
Preservation Act, of a joint operating agreement between two major newspapers. The approval
essentially exempted the arrangement from antitrust laws. Judge Ginsburg dissented on the
grounds that the Attorney General had interpreted the exemption too broadly and failed to
adequately explain his decision to override two administrative decisions below rejecting the
agreement. On an unsuccessful request for rehearing en bane, she joined her Carter-appointed

colleagues., An evenly divided Supreme Court affirmed the panel decision in Michigan Citizens
for an Independent Press v. Thornburgh, 493 U.S. 38 (1989). Justice White did not participate
in the case.

American Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Service, 891 F.2d 304 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The
majority held that the union had standing to challenge the Postal Service's decision to suspend its
monopoly over international mail because union members' jobs would be affected. Concurring,
Judge Ginsburg emphasized that the Postal Services' rulemaking proceedings did not adequately
address critical comments. The Supreme Court reversed in Air Courier Conference v. American
Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517 (1991), holding that the union did not have standing.
Justice White voted with the majority.

Boston & Maine Corp. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 911 F.2d 743 (D.C. Cir. 1990).
The court held that the ICC could not invoke condemnation power under the Rail Passenger
Service Act to take possession of SO miles of track held by B & M to give to Amtrak, which
immediately transferred it to a third railroad line. In a concurring opinion, Judge Ginsburg
agreed that the ICC's assessment was inadequate in this case, but she stopped short of the
majority's ruling that the agency could not exercise its full eminent domain power when
Amtrak's only aim was to secure use, but not possession, of tracks. The Supreme Court
reversed in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Boston & Maine Corp., 112 S. Ct. 1394
(1992). The Court stated that the ICC's interpretation of the Act and its exercise of authority
were reasonable. Dissenting, Justice White wrote that the ICC's findings justifying the taking
were inadequate.

                   It is particularly important to NAPABA that Judge
Ginsburg's overall record also suggests that she is
sensitive to issues that significantly affect minority
communities. For example, her opinion for the court in
Spann v. Colonial Village. Inc.. 899 F.2d 24 (D.C. Cir.
1990), indicates that she understands the importance under
the civil rights laws of ensuring meaningful access to the
courts to combat discrimination. In Spann. the court upheld
the use of "testers" by fair housing organizations seeking
to challenge discriminatory housing practices.

                  Judge Ginsburg has also demonstrated support for
actions designed to remedy the adverse consequences of
discrimination. In Q'Donnell Construction Co. v. District
of Columbia. 963 F.2d 420 (D.C. Cir. 1992), in which the
court struck down the D.C. minority set-aside program, Judge
Ginsburg concurred in the decision as mandated by citv of
Richmond v. Croson. 488 U.S. 469 (1989), but emphasized that
Croson did not hold minority preference programs to be
unconstitutional per se or to be limited to redress of state
sponsored discrimination. 963 F.2d at 429. She pointed out
that "remedy for past wrong is not the exclusive basis upon
which racial classification may be justified."" Id. (citing
Croson. 488 U.S. at 511 (Stevens, J., concurring)).

                   Furthermore, Judge Ginsburg has shown an
understanding of the concerns and experiences of Asian
Pacific Americans in at least two cases before her. In
Hohri v. United States. 782 F.2d 227 (D.C. Cir. 1986),
vacated and remanded. 482 U.S. 64 (1987), Judge Ginsburg
joined in a panel decision which allowed Japanese American
victims of the disgraceful World War II internment camps to
bring an action under the Takings Clause of the
Constitution, challenging the confiscation of their
property. The panel decision found that the statute of
limitations had been tolled by reason of the government's
misrepresentations to the Supreme Court in the Hirabayashi
and Korematsu cases. The court later denied a rehearing of
the decision en bane, in which Judge Bork, dissenting at
length, criticized the panel opinion as one in which
"compassion displaces law." 793 F.2d 313 (Bork, J.,
dissenting). Judge Ginsburg and Judge J. Skelly Wright, in
a joint statement, responded to each legal point raised and
noted that the panel opinion dealt "particularly and
precisely with the special facts of an extraordinary episode
of injustice."

                   In Jacobs v. Barr. 959 F.2d 313 (D.C. Cir. 1992),
Judge Ginsburg joined in a panel decision rejecting a
challenge brought against the civil Liberties Act of 1988 by
                               681

a German American who had been interned with his father
during World War II. The Act was passed to compensate
Japanese Americans who had been victims of the government's
decision during World War II to send them to internment
camps solely because of their race, and to apologize for the
"grave injustice" they had suffered. The plaintiff argued
that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause because it
did not compensate German Americans who had been interned.
The court noted, however, that Congress considered
"extensive evidence" that Japanese Americans were interned
solely for reasons of racial prejudice, while German
Americans (who received individual hearings) were not. Id.
at 321.

                   In summary, NAPABA believes that Judge Ginsburg is
well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United
States not only with respect to her technical skills and
judicial temperament, but also with respect to her
sensitivity to the concerns of racial and ethnic minorities.
NAPABA recommends that the Committee confirm her
appointment.

                                               Sincerely yours,

                            u^Co^ C-
