NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO BE AS-
   SOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
  OF THE UNITED STATES

                     THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1990

                                                                      U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in room
215, Senate Hart Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Spec-
ter, and Humphrey.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Welcome, Judge Souter. The committee is delighted to have you
here this morning. Let me, before I make my opening statement,
just go through very, very briefly the procedure we hope to follow
this morning.
  As is the custom of the committee, Judge, each member of the
Judiciary Committee, on such a solemn and important occasion as
this, makes an opening statement. We will limit our opening state-
ments to 10 minutes apiece. But with the number we have here,
you can see that is going to take a while, at which time we would
then proceed, Judge, to having your colleagues from New Hamp-
shire, Senator Humphrey and Senator Rudman, introduce you.
After that point, we will then ask you to stand to be sworn and
then to deliver your opening statement.
  Now, I expect, in light of the clock and the time and the number
of statements, that we will probably break for lunch before you
make your opening statement. So I expect the first item of business
after we break for lunch will be your opening statement, at which
time we will then begin questioning. In order to have some pros-
pect of a genuine exchange on matters of consequence, it has been
my practice and my predecessors before me, Chairman Kennedy
and Chairman Thurmond, to have that first round of questioning
be a half-hour--that each Senator have one-half hour to question
you.
  I do not anticipate going late tonight or any night during this
process, and I do not anticipate that we are going to have to bring
a knapsack for any of these proceedings. Today, our lunch break
will occur whatever the convenient moment is after Senators have

                                                          (1)
made their opening statements. If there is still time, we will ask
Senators Humphrey and Rudman to make their statements and
you be sworn. If not, that will be put over until the afternoon.

  I again, Judge Souter, welcome you to this committee.
  Seven weeks ago, President Bush discharged one of his most im-
portant constitutional responsibilities, one of the most important
responsibilities assigned to the Chief Executive of this Nation, by
selecting you to be his nominee for Associate Justice to the Su-
preme Court of the United States.
  Today, we, the members of the Judiciary Committee and the
Senate as a whole, embark on a solemn task that article II of the
Constitution commits to this body: The Senate's responsibility to
offer its "advice and consent" to the President's nomination.
  As these hearings begin, I believe this committee's role in that
process is threefold:
  First, and foremost, in my view, we must conduct a fair and thor-
ough hearing that will provide you with a full opportunity to
present your constitutional philosophy to the Senate and, I might
add, to the Nation;
  Second, we must explore those views with you, to try to identify
the meaning you would give to our Constitution, if you become
"Justice Souter"; and
  Third, we must decide--each Senator, bound by his own con-
science--whether that constitutional vision is the one that this
Nation should have.
  These have been our obligations for many years now, obligations
that the Constitution makes it our duty to complete. And to fulfill
our constitutional duties, Judge Souter, we will need your help.
  You come before us without an extensive record that details your
views on important constitutional questions of our time. And I say
that not critically. I say that as an observation. You are an ex-
tremely bright man with an extremely admirable record. But the
past responsibilities you have had have not required you to enun-
ciate your views in any detail on major constitutional issues and
questions. As a result, we need your help for us to be able to under-
stand your constitutional philosophy, the philosophy that you
would bring to the Nation's highest court. We need you to join us
in a meaningful and important dialog about the Constitution.
  And let me be clear on one point, Judge. As chairman of this
committee, I am not asking you for any commitments as to how
you would vote on any specific case, nor am I trying to pry nor am
I attempting to pry into your personal views on publicly debated
issues.
  Rather, we want to know what principles you would apply, what
philosophies you would employ as you exercise the awesome--and I
emphasize awesome--the awesome power you will hold if you are
confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States.
  The Supreme Court holds far-reaching power over the constitu-
tional rights and daily lives of every American. Throughout the
course of our history, its impact--upon what we can do, what we
can say, and how we can live--has equaled that of any President or
any Congress.
  The fact of the matter is that we hold many of the freedoms we
enjoy today because of the wisdom and the courage--and I empha-
size the courage--and foresight of the 104 Justices who have sat on
the Supreme Court.

  But there have been moments in our history when the Court,
like other institutions in this Nation, has come to a crossroads, mo-
ments when the Court's future has confronted its past, moments
when its long-term direction is at stake, or at least in question.

  It is at these moments in particular when the Court is most
shaped by the outlook and philosophy of individuals who serve as
Justices. In my view, Judge Souter, we are witnessing just such a
moment in our history.

  Today, our Nation, our Constitution as interpreted by the Court,
is at a crossroads. There are some very fundamental choices to be
made:

  Will the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion con-
tinue to protect the rights of all Americans--Protestant and Catho-
lic, Jewish and Moslem--to practice their faith and practice it in a
way of their choosing? Or will we begin to change the standard by
which we judge whether a religious practice can be impacted upon
by a governmental body?

  Will the fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments protecting our civil
liberties--of a fair trial, of freedom from unreasonable searches--
remain intact as it is today? Will it be scaled back, giving govern-
ment more power, or changed, giving individuals more impact and
control?

  It is a question, as they say in the vernacular, that is up for
grabs today.

  Will the power of the 14th amendment's equal protection
clause--used to root our discrimination against racial minorities
and women in our society--be diminished? Again, will government
be given more control?

  And will the majestic sweep of the 14th amendment's due proc-
ess clause, which protects the right of privacy of all Americans, be
curtailed, changed, or in any way affected?

  Judge Souter, because of the close division on the Court on the
meaning of these constitutional guarantees, many of which are di-
vided 5 to 4 or, in essence, now will be 4 to 4, you, Judge Souter,
are the single man in this room who can affect in the near term
the outcome of all these issues. With this close division, will you
have and how will you exercise and determine which way you will
vote, deciding which direction the Court will go on a dozen issues
we could probably both name? You will have the power to deter-
mine which direction the Nation will take, which path we will
follow, as we reach this critical crossroads.

  Let there be no mistake about it, Judge Souter. If confirmed, the
fate of our private lives and our public responsibilities will be
placed in your hands in a very significant way.

  Judge, I sincerely hope--and expect, quite frankly--that you will
join me in a dialog on the Constitution, a dialog in which you re-
spond with specific answers to specific questions, specific questions
about the due process clause and its protection of our right to pri-
vate and individual liberty; the equal protection clause and its
guarantees of racial equality and equal rights for women; the first
amendment and its protection of freedom of speech and freedom of
religion; and other important constitutional issues of our day.

   At this fateful moment in our history, Judge, we have a right to
know, a duty to discover, precisely what you, Judge David Hackett
Souter, think about the great constitutional issues of our time.

   I believe we can engage in a real discussion on these issues while
respecting your judicial independence. We value impartiality in our
judicial officers, and it is not a function of these hearings to tres-
pass upon any boundaries that are set by or need to be maintained
to guarantee that independence.

   Yet the office of a Supreme Court Justice inures to no one by
birth, no one by right, and no one as a consequence of a nomina-
tion by the President of the United States. To attain that post, a
nominee has the obligation to persuade the Senate that he or she is
the person in whose hands we should agree to vest this awesome
power and responsibility.

  No one is entitled to be a Supreme Court Justice any more than
a member of this committee is entitled to be a U.S. Senator.

  Judge, put bluntly, the burden of proof is on you--Judge Souter,
the nominee--as it is on us when we stand for election. If a majori-
ty of the electorate deems us to be the right person for the job,
given the particular time and circumstances facing this country,
then we will be. And a Supreme Court Justice can assume his post
only if the Senate is persuaded that the nominee is the right
person for that position at that particular juncture of American
history.

  Judge, as I said, the power is awesome, the duty is profound, the
obligation is yours, and the responsibility is ours.

  No one knows, Judge Souter, what questions the Supreme Court
will have to resolve in the year 2024, the year until which you will
serve on the Court, God willing, should you be confirmed and serve
as long as your predecessor--2024.

  Of one thing, though, we can be sure.
  If the history of this great Nation is any guide, tomorrow's
issues--whatever form they take--will pit governmental power
against individual liberty; majority tyranny against personal
rights; the danger of discrimination against the dream of equality
for all Americans.

  For 200 years, the Supreme Court of the United States has
served as the court of last resort in such struggles--the final guard-
ian of our fundamental rights.

  So it was for our parents and our grandparents, and so I hope it
will be for our children and our grandchildren in the 21st century.

  If confirmed, you, Judge Souter--more than any other person in
this room--will decide what the Constitution means for the next
generation. We will long be gone from this bench while you are
still sitting on the Supreme Court of the United States, helping
decide the fate of this great Nation. To consent to your nomination,
we must have considerable guidance as to what kind of Supreme
Court, what vision of the Constitution you will provide for our
grandchildren.

  For the next few days, Judge Souter, open for us a window into
your mind, and give us a little bit of a glimpse into your heart.

  [The prepared statement of Chairman Biden follows:]
                                          OPENING STATEMENT
                                 SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
              HEARINGS ON THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE DAVID SOUTER
              TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
                                THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1990

         JUDGE SOUTER, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

         SEVEN WEEKS AGO, PRESIDENT BUSH DISCHARGED ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES ASSIGNED TO THE CHIEF
EXECUTIVE, BY SELECTING YOU TO BE HIS NOMINEE FOR THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT.

        TODAY, WE EMBARK ON A SOLEMN TASK THAT ARTICLE II OF THE
CONSTITUTION COMMITS TO THIS BODY -- THE SENATE'S RESPONSIBILITY
TO OFFER ITS "ADVICE AND CONSENT" TO THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION.

        AS THESE HEARINGS BEGIN, I BELIEVE THIS COMMITTEE'S ROLE IN
THE PROCESS IS THREE-FOLD:

         * FIRST -- AND FOREMOST -- WE MUST CONDUCT FAIR AND
                 THOROUGH HEARINGS THAT PROVIDE YOU WITH A FULL
                 OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL PHILOSOPHY TO
                 THE SENATE AND TO THE NATION;
                                                    -- 2--
          * SECOND, WE MUST EXPLORE THOSE VIEWS WITH YOU, TO TRY TO

                  IDENTIFY THE MEANING YOU WOULD GIVE TO OUR CONSTITUTION,
                  IF YOU BECAME "JUSTICE DAVID SOUTER;" AND

         * THIRD, WE MUST DECIDE -- EACH SENATOR, BOUND BY HIS OWN
                  CONSCIENCE -- WHETHER THAT CONSTITUTIONAL VISION IS ONE
                  THAT THE NATION SHOULD EMBRACE.

         THESE HAVE BEEN OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MANY YEARS NOW --
OBLIGATIONS THAT THE CONSTITUTION MAKES IT OUR DUTY TO COMPLETE.

         TO FULFILL OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES, JUDGE SOUTER, WE WILL
NEED YOUR HELP.

         YOU COME BEFORE US WITHOUT AN EXTENSIVE WRITTEN RECORD THAT
DETAILS YOUR VIEWS ON THE IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS OF OUR
TIME. AS A RESULT, WE NEED YOU TO HELP US IN UNDERSTANDING THE
CONSTITUTIONAL PHILOSOPHY YOU WOULD BRING TO THE NATION'S HIGHEST
COURT. WE NEED YOU TO JOIN US IN A MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT
DIALOGUE ABOUT OUR CONSTITUTION.

        AND LET ME BE CLEAR ON ONE POINT, JUDGE: WE ARE NOT ASKING
FOR ANY COMMITMENTS AS TO HOW YOU WOULD RULE ON ANY SPECIFIC CASE
-- NOR ARE WE TRYING TO PRY INTO YOUR PERSONAL VIEWS ON PUBLICLY-
DEBATED ISSUES.
                                                    - 3-
         RATHER, WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT PRINCIPLES YOU WOULD APPLY --
WHAT PHILOSOPHIES YOU WOULD EMPLOY -- AS YOU EXERCISE THE AWESOME
POWER YOU WILL HOLD IF YOU ARE CONFIRMED AS A JUSTICE OF THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT.

         THE SUPREME COURT HOLDS FAR-REACHING POWER OVER THE
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE DAILY LIVES OF EVERY AMERICAN
CITIZEN. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY, ITS IMPACT -- UPON
WHAT WE CAN DO, WHAT WE CAN SAY, AND HOW WE CAN LIVE -- HAS
EXCEEDED THAT OF ANY PRESIDENT OR ANY CONGRESS.

         THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HOLD MANY OF THE FREEDOMS
WE ENJOY BECAUSE OF THE WISDOM, COURAGE AND FORESIGHT OF THE 104
JUSTICES WHO HAVE SAT ON THE SUPREME COURT.

        BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS IN HISTORY WHEN THE COURT -- LIKE
OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN THIS NATION -- HAS COME TO A CROSSROADS;
MOMENTS WHEN THE COURT'S FUTURE HAS CONFRONTED ITS PAST -- MOMENTS
WHEN ITS LONG-TERM DIRECTION HAS BEEN AT STAKE.

         IT IS AT THESE MOMENTS WHEN THE COURT IS MOST SHAPED BY THE
OUTLOOK AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVE AS JUSTICES.
IN MY VIEW, WE ARE WITNESSING SUCH A MOMENT TODAY.

        TODAY, OUR NATION -- OUR CONSTITUTION AS INTERPRETED BY THE
COURT -- IS AT A CROSSROADS. THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES
             - 4-

TO BE MADE:

* WILL THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM OF
        RELIGION CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS
        -- PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC; JEWISH AND MUSLIM -- TO
        PRACTICE THE FAITH OF THEIR CHOOSING?

* WILL THE FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH AMENDMENT'S PROTECTION
        OF CIVIL LIBERTIES ~ OF A FAIR TRIAL AND FREEDOM FROM
        UNREASONABLE SEARCHES ~ REMAIN STRONG?

* WILL THE POWER OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S EQUAL
        PROTECTION CLAUSE ~ USED TO ROOT OUT DISCRIMINATION
        AGAINST RACIAL MINORITIES AND WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY -- BE
        DIMINISHED?

* AND WILL THE MAJESTIC SWEEP OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S
        DUE PROCESS CLAUSE -- WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY
        OF ALL AMERICANS -- BE CURTAILED?

JUDGE SOUTER, BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE DIVISION ON THE COURT ON THE
MEANING OF THESE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, IF YOU ARE CONFIRMED,
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE WHICH DIRECTION THIS NATION
WILL TAKE ~ WHICH PATH WE WILL FOLLOW AS WE REACH THIS CRITICAL
CONSTITUTIONAL CROSSROAD.

         LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, JUDGE SOUTER. IF CONFIRMED,
THE FATE OF OUR PRIVATE LIVES AND OUR PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES WILL
BE PLACED IN YOUR HANDS.

         I SINCERELY HOPE, JUDGE, THAT YOU WILL JOIN ME IN A DIALOGUE
ON THE CONSTITUTION -- A DIALOGUE IN WHICH YOU RESPOND WITH
SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO MY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT:

         * THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE AND ITS PROTECTION OF OUR RIGHT
                  TO PRIVACY AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY;

         * THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE AND ITS GUARANTEES OF RACIAL
                  EQUALITY AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN;

         * THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND ITS PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF
                  SPEECH AND RELIGION;

         * AND OTHER IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY.

         AT THIS FATEFUL MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
         -- AND A DUTY TO DISCOVERY -- PRECISELY WHAT YOU, JUDGE DAVID
         HACKETT SOUTER, THINK ABOUT THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS
         OF OUR TIME.

         I BELIEVE WE CAN ENGAGE IN A REAL DISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES
WHILE RESPECTING YOUR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. WE VALUE IMPARTIALITY

                                                    - 6-
IN OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS, AND IT IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THESE
HEARINGS TO TRESPASS UPON ANY BOUNDARIES THAT ARE SET BY THE NEED
TO MAINTAIN THAT INDEPENDENCE.

         YET THE OFFICE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE INURES TO NO ONE BY
BIRTH OR BY RIGHT -- OR BY VIRTUE OF A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
ALONE. TO ATTAIN THAT POST, A NOMINEE MUST PERSUADE THE SENATE
THAT HE OR SHE IS THE PERSON IN WHOSE HANDS WE SHOULD AGREE TO VEST
AWESOME POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY.

         NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, ANY MORE
THAN ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS "ENTITLED" TO BE A SENATOR.

        THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON YOU, JUDGE SOUTER, THE NOMINEE --
AS IT IS ON US, WHEN WE SEEK ELECTION AS SENATORS. WE HOLD OUR
POSTS ONLY IF A MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE DEEMS US THE RIGHT
PERSONS FOR THE JOB, GIVEN THE PARTICULAR TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES
FACING THE COUNTRY. AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CAN ASSUME HIS
POST ONLY IF THE SENATE IS PERSUADED THAT THE NOMINEE IS THE RIGHT
PERSON FOR THAT POSITION, AT THAT PARTICULAR JUNCTION IN HISTORY.

        THE POWER IS AWESOME, THE DUTY IS PROFOUND, THE OBLIGATION IS
        YOURS, THE RESPONSIBILITY IS OURS.

        NO ONE KNOWS, JUDGE SOUTER, WHAT QUESTIONS THE SUPREME COURT
                                        11

                                                    - 7-
WILL HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THE YEAR 2024 -- THE YEAR UNTIL WHICH YOU
WILL SERVE ON THE COURT SHOULD YOU BE CONFIRMED AND SERVE AS LONG
AS YOUR PREDECESSOR DID.

         OF ONE THING, THOUGH, WE CAN BE SURE.

         IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, TOMORROW'S ISSUES -- WHATEVER FORM
THEY TAKE -- WILL PIT GOVERNMENTAL POWER AGAINST INDIVIDUAL
LIBERTY; MAJORITY TYRANNY AGAINST PERSONAL RIGHTS; THE DANGER OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE DREAM OF EQUALITY FOR ALL AMERICANS.

         FOR 200 YEARS, THE SUPREME COURT HAS SERVED AS THE COURT OF
LAST RESORT IN SUCH STRUGGLES -- THE FINAL GUARDIAN OF OUR
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.

         SO IT WAS FOR OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS; AND SO I HOPE IT
WILL BE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

         IF CONFIRMED, YOU, JUDGE SOUTER -- MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON
IN THIS ROOM ~ WILL DECIDE WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS FOR OUR
NEXT GENERATION. TO CONSENT TO YOUR NOMINATION, WE MUST HAVE
CONSIDERABLE GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT KIND OF SUPREME COURT -- WHAT
VISION OF THE CONSTITUTION -- YOU WILL PROVIDE FOR THEM.

       FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS, JUDGE SOUTER, OPEN FOR US A WINDOW INTO
YOUR MIND.

                                               -O-

   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR STROM THURMOND

   Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Chairman, today the committee begins hearings to consider
the nomination of Judge David H. Souter to be an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States. This marks the 6th
nominee to the Supreme Court that this committee has considered
in the past 9 years and, once confirmed, would be the 105th person
to serve as a Justice. As well, I might say, it is the 23d Supreme
Court nomination that I have had the opportunity to review during
my 36 years in the Senate.

   As we begin the hearing process, we must remain keenly aware
that it is a solemn responsibility. Those chosen for appointment to
this Nation's highest court occupy a position of great power and
authority, as this appointment is one of life tenure granted without
accountability by popular election. With this position of great
status comes a greater responsibility to the people of this Nation--
to the concept of justice, and to the Constitution.

  Mr. Chairman, I have always believed that the Constitution is
the greatest document ever penned by the hand of man. The Con-
stitution creates the basic institutions of our National Government
and spells out the power of these institutions, the requirements for
holding office, and the rights of our citizens. Our Constitution is
the fundamental law of the land. It is the basis for laws written by
Federal, State, and local governing bodies, and it defines the sepa-
ration of power between the individual States and our National
Government. The fact that our Constitution has survived since its
adoption in 1787 is a true testament to its enduring nature.

  Our magnificent Constitution confers tremendous responsibility
on both the House and the Senate to declare war, maintain the
Armed Forces, borrow money, regulate commerce, mint currency,
and make all laws necessary for the operation of Government.
However, the Senate alone holds exclusive to "advise and consent"
on all judicial nominations, without a doubt one of the most impor-
tant responsibilities undertaken by the Senate. It is a responsibility
that takes on greater significance when a nomination is made to
the highest court in the land. The Senate has assigned the task of
holding hearings and reviewing judicial nominees to the Judiciary
Committee. It is our duty to make the recommendation to the full
Senate. This critical role in the judicial process must be equitable,
thorough, and diligent. It is this committee that will be called upon
to cast the first vote which will in all likelihood determine the fact
of this nomination. I am not aware of any nominee to the Supreme
Court in this country who has failed to attain a majority of the
votes of the members of this committee and then been confirmed
by the full Senate. This track record clearly underscores the impor-
tance of our responsibility.

  The role of the Supreme Court in America's development has
been vital because the Court has faced many difficult issues, using
its collective intellectual capacity, precedent, and constitutional in-
terpretation to address such issues as criminal law, privacy rights,
church-state relations, freedom of speech and press, the death pen-
                                       13

alty, civil rights, and much, much more. Throughout the course of
this Nation's history, the Court has been thrust into the center of
many difficult controversies. As Justice Holmes stated: "We are
quiet here, but it is the quiet of a storm center."

  Due to the broad range of difficult, controversial, and important
issues which must be resolved by the Court and the impact of its
decisions, great responsibility is placed upon each Justice. An Asso-
ciate Justice must be an individual who possesses outstanding
qualifications. In the past, I have reflected upon the judicial qualifi-
cations. The attributes I believe a nominee to the Court should pos-
sess are:

  First, unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be honest, abso-
lutely incorruptible, and completely fair and just.

  Second, courage. The courage to decide tough cases according to
the law and the Constitution.

  Third, compassion. While a nominee must be firm in his deci-
sions, he should show mercy when appropriate.

  Fourth, professional competence. The ability to master the com-
plexity of the law.

  Fifth, proper judicial temperament. The self-discipline to base de-
cisions on logic, not emotion, and to have respect for lawyers, liti-
gants, and court officials.

  Sixth, an understanding of the majesty of our system of govern-
ment. The understanding that Congress makes the laws, that the
Constitution is changed by amendment, and that powers not dele-
gated to the Federal Government are reserved to the States.

  An individual who possesses these attributes cannot fail the
cause of justice.

  My review of the background of this nominee convinces me, as
we start these hearings, that he possesses the necessary qualifica-
tions to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court. His in-
tellectual credential are impeccable: Phi Beta Kappa, Rhodes schol-
ar, undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard, and graduate
study at Oxford University. His experience is extraordinary: Cur-
rently serving as a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
First Judicial Circuit, formerly an associate justice of the New
Hampshire Supreme Court for 7 years, previously served as a judge
on the New Hampshire Superior Court for 5 years, served as the
attorney general for the State of New Hampshire, held positions as
deputy attorney general, assistant attorney general, and practiced
law in the private sector.

  Recently, Judge Souter's professional experience and qualifica-
tions were scrutinized by the American Bar Association in connec-
tion with his appointment to the first circuit and his nomination to
the Supreme Court. For both positions, the ABA gave Judge Souter
the highest possible rating based on his professional competence,
integrity, and judicial temperament. Without question, Judge
Souter has the professional credentials to serve on this Nation's
highest court. He has long been known as a man of keen intellect
and devotion to the law--a perception certainly warranted by his
distinguished professional record.

  Mr. Chairman, our critical role in the selection process of a Su-
preme Court Justice requires us to carefully examine and review
the intellectual capacity, moral character, and background of a
                                       14

nominee. However, it does not convey the right to question a nomi-
nee about how he or she would decide a particular case. It is inap-
propriate to ask a nominee how he would rule for several reasons.
A nominee cannot, and should not be expected to, indicate how he
would rule until there has been an opportunity to fully examine
precedent and relevant law, to study briefs, and to listen to oral
argument. Only after a complete review of all the facts and rele-
vant law, and after sufficient time for calm, rational deliberation,
should an individual be called upon to render a decision. Direct
questioning about sensitive issues that may come before the Court
could impinge on the concept of an impartial, independent judici-
ary. We must take all precautions to ensure that the judiciary is
shielded from the political pressures that are imposed on the legis-
lative and executive branches. For these reasons, I urge all mem-
bers of this committee to be diligent, thorough, and thought-pro-
voking in questioning this nominee, but not to exceed the appropri-
ateness to the purpose for which these questions are intended.

  Mr. Chairman, a member of the Supreme Court must consider
hundreds, even thousands of issues during his or her tenure. No
one issue should be the sole criteria by which a nominee is judged
fit to serve. While any one issue may now be more prominent than
others, as times change so will the issues before the Court. A Su-
preme Court member is confirmed for life, not put in place to make
short-term decisions to satisfy any political constituency. A
member of the Supreme Court makes decisions in a vast array of
areas which affect all the people of this Nation and not just one
individual or a particular group. To expect otherwise would dimin-
ish this august institution.

  Mr. Chairman, I believe a nominee selected by the President of
the United States for the Supreme Court comes to the Senate with
a presumption in his favor. As well, a man who has been recently
considered by the Senate and unanimously confirmed comes with
an even greater presumption in his favor.

  The Framers of the Constitution established the judicial branch
as a coequal branch of government, along with the legislative and
executive branches. In 1803, Chief Justice John Marshall stated
that "it is the duty of the judicial department to say what the law
is." Because the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of legal dis-
putes, its authority is immense. With that view in mind and a keen
awareness of the great responsibility facing each of us, I look for-
ward to a fair, thorough review of Judge Souter's intellectual ca-
pacity, background, and his sense of justice.

  Judge Souter, we welcome you to the committee and look for-
ward to your testimony.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Just before I yield to Senator Kennedy, let me explain, Judge. I
noticed you heard that buzzer. The way this place works is the
Senate is in session as we conduct this hearing; that is, over on the
Senate floor. I failed to mention that for you and for some in the
audience. Those buzzers indicate whether or not there are votes,
and we may at some point during this hearing today have to--some
will get up and go vote and come back while we are trying to keep
this thing going. So that is what that buzzer was about, and I
                                      15

apologize. They do tend to break one's concentration. But if we
don't show up when those buzzers ring, it tends to break our lon-
gevity in the Senate.

  The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY
  Senator KENNEDY. Good morning, Judge Souter. I don't know
how you are enjoying it up until now, but it will get better later
on. [Laughter.]
  Today, the Senate begins one of the most important tasks en-
trusted to it under the Constitution: consideration of a nomination
to the Supreme Court. In this remarkable time when democracy is
spreading through Eastern Europe and Latin America, the Consti-
tution stands more than ever as a timeless ideal for peoples
throughout the world, a charter that protects the fundamental
rights and liberties that are essential to human dignity. And it is
more important than ever that we uphold these values in our own
country.
  The Constitution itself is silent on what standard the Senate
should apply in weighing a Supreme Court nomination. The very
notion of Senate confirmation of judicial nominees selected by the
President was a last minute compromise reached by the Framers.
Those who drafted the Constitution had originally proposed that
the Senate alone select judicial nominees. The final compromise,
which assigns shared responsibility to the President and the
Senate, was adopted as one of the key checks and balances to
assure that neither the President nor the Senate would have exces-
sive influence over the Supreme Court and other Federal courts.
  The true genius of the modern Constitution and Bill of Rights is
also apparent in the establishment of an independent Federal judi-
ciary, sworn to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of indi-
viduals against the excesses of government. The Supreme Court
has the last word on the meaning of the Constitution, and its deci-
sions have a profound impact on all our lives.
  In the past half century, the Supreme Court has played a central
role in the effort to make America a better and fairer land. The
Court outlawed segregation in the schools, removed barriers to the
right to vote, strengthened the basic rights of minorities, and took
major steps to end the second-class status of women in our society.
  In considering a Supreme Court nomination, the Senate must
make two inquiries. The first is a threshold issue: Does the nomi-
nee have the intelligence, integrity, and temperament to meet the
responsibilities of a Supreme Court Justice?
  But that is not the only inquiry. The Senate must also determine
whether the nominee possesses a clear commitment to the funda-
mental values at the core of our constitutional democracy.
  In this second inquiry, the burden of proof rests with those who
support a nomination. Our constitutional freedoms are the historic
legacy of every American. They are too important, and the sacrific-
es made to protect those freedoms have been too great, to be en-
trusted to judges who lack this clear commitment. If a Senator is
left with substantial doubts about a nominee's dedication to these
                                       16

core values, our own constitutional responsibility requires us to
oppose the nomination.

  This is not to suggest any single-issue litmus test. Nominees
should be judged on their overall approach to the Constitution. I
have frequently supported nominees whose views on particular con-
stitutional issues are very different from my own. But the Senate
should not confirm a Supreme Court nomination unless we are per-
suaded that the nominee is committed to upholding the essential
values at the heart of our constitutional tradition.

  Recent developments at the Supreme Court have increased the
importance of this inquiry by the Senate. Over the past few years,
the Court has retreated from its historic role in protecting civil
rights and civil liberties. In case after case, the Court has adopted
narrow and restrictive interpretations of important civil rights
laws. The Senate is entitled to ensure that nominees to the Na-
tion's highest court share Congress' view that these laws must be
interpreted generously, to provide effective remedies to eliminate
unfair discrimination in all of its forms.

  Judge Souter has a distinguished intellectual background, and he
has spent the great majority of his legal career in public service.
But aspects of his record on the bench and while serving in the
New Hampshire attorney general's office raise troubling questions
about the depth of his commitment to the indispensable role of the
Supreme Court in protecting individual rights and liberties.

  While on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Judge Souter
wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that the meaning of the State
constitution should be confined to the specific intent of those who
drafted it in the 18th century. Applied to the U.S. Constitution that
view would have prevented the Supreme Court from outlawing
school segregation in 1954. It would effectively stop the Court today
from applying the Constitution to protect our fundamental rights
from government intrusions not anticipated by the Framers two
centuries ago. In this day and age our constitutional freedoms are
too important to entrust to Justices who would turn back the clock
on these basic issues.

  While Judge Souter was serving in the New Hampshire Attorney
General's office, he took a number of very troubling positions.

  He argued that Congress does not have the constitutional author-
ity to ban State literacy tests for voting, even though such tests
place needless barriers on the exercise of the most important right
in a democracy--the right to vote.

  He argued that Congress did not have the constitutional author-
ity to require employers to file reports with the Federal Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission showing the overall racial com-
position of their work force--reports that are vitally important in
investigating claims of discrimination.

  He questioned the standard adopted by the Supreme Court to
ban most forms of sex discrimination.

  He referred to abortion as the "killing of unborn children" and
opposed the repeal of an unconstitutional State abortion statute.

  He defended the constitutionality of an order by the Governor of
New Hampshire that flags on State buildings must be lowered to
half-mast on Good Friday--an order enjoined by the courts because
                                          17

it clearly violated the constitutional requirement of separation of
church and state.

  In a commencement speech, Judge Souter, stated that affirma-
tive action programs are affirmative discrimination and suggested
that the Government should not be involved in promoting such
programs.

   It is true that all but the last of these positions were taken by
Judge Souter while serving in the New Hampshire Attorney Gen-
eral's Office in the course of defending actions taken by the State
government, and the views that he expressed as the State's lawyer
are not necessarily his own.

   But these positions are troubling. There is little in his record
that demonstrates real solicitude for the rights of those who are
weakest and most powerless in our society, and who have histori-
cally had the most difficulty in obtaining these rights from the ma-
jorities that rule the legislatures in our democracy.

  It is the responsibility of this committee to find out whether
Judge Souter is committed to these rights and to the other basic
values enshrined in the Constitution. It is these values that make
America America and that determine the kind of country that we
will be in the years ahead.

  That is why these hearings on Judge Souter's nomination are so
important and I look forward to his testimony.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ORRIN G. HATCH

   Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I would like to welcome you, Judge Souter, to our committee and
I hope that your hearing goes well. Having met you, and having
chatted with you and having looked at you for better than 3 years
now, or about 2V2 years, I want to tell you that I am very im-
pressed with your impeccable educational and legal background,
and also with your experience in both the executive and judicial
branches of government, at least State government at that time.

   We have already heard, and of course we are going to hear some
more today about your distinguished legal career.

  Judge Souter, incidentally, is the first Supreme Court Justice or
nominee from New Hampshire in 145 years. This is rather surpris-
ing given New Hampshire's prominent role every 4 years in the
first step in the judicial selection process--namely the selection of
the President.

   I might add that people across the political spectrum in New
Hampshire have told me of their high regard for you as both a
man and as a jurist. I share President Bush's view that a Supreme
Court Justice should interpret the law and not legislate his or her
own policy preferences from the bench. The role of the judicial
branch is to enforce the provisions of the Constitution and the laws
that we enact in Congress, among other things, as their meaning
was originally intended by those who framed those laws. That does
not necessarily mean that they cannot adjust to the needs of a
modern society.
                                       18
   Any other philosophy of judging requires unelected Federal
judges to impose their own personal views on the American people
in the guise of construing the Constitution and Federal statutes.
There is no other way around this conclusion. This other approach
is judicial activism, plain and simple and it can come from the po-
litical left and it can come from the political right.
   When judges depart from these principles of construction, they
elevate themselves not only over the executive and legislative
branches, but over the Constitution itself, and, of course, over the
American people. These judicial activists, whether of the left or
right, undemocratically exercise the power of governance that the
Constitution commits to the people and their elected representa-
tives. These judicial activists are limited only by their own will--
which of course is no limit at all.
  I would also note parenthetically that Judge Souter must be
evaluated on his own merits, not on how four other Justices might
vote. Judge Souter is going to cast one vote on the Supreme Court,
if confirmed, and not five or not four others. So we might say that
that is an important consideration.
  Now, we have all read and we have all heard of the anxiety of
many private interest groups which prefer an activist Supreme
Court to impose certain political outcomes on the American people.
They are disappointed that they have been unable to ascertain ex-
actly where Judge Souter stands or how he might vote on many
issues of concern to them. Having been unable to do so, but fearing
that Judge Souter will actually be faithful to the Constitution
rather than to their own particular policy preferences, when the
latter cannot be justified by the former, some of these groups seem
to be hoping that there will be something uncovered to derail
Judge Souter.
  In the words of William F. Buckley, Jr., in National Review Mag-
azine, he said, "If only he had smoked marijuana or streaked at an
American Bar Association banquet, no such luck."
  I want to respond to one of the misguided observations we have
heard about this nominee. That is that Judge Souter does not have
a record on which to evaluate him and that he lacks a paper
trail--that is nonsense. Judge Souter has authored over 200 opin-
ions during 7 years as a justice on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court and additional opinions as a New Hampshire Superior Court
judge.
  He has joined in the decisions in hundreds of other appeals.
Scarcely a dozen Justices in the 200-year history of the Supreme
Court have been nominated with a more extensive judicial back-
ground. His legal reasoning is on record in those opinions and I
note that those cases indicate that Judge Souter is a solid law and
order jurist--tough but fair with criminal defendants.
  This balance is of the greatest importance to the citizens of Utah
and of other States. We Utahns welcome visitors from everywhere
and we try to provide a safe environment for them and our own
people. By the same token we like to travel around the country and
to do so in safety. That safety greatly depends on our criminal jus-
tice system. We need sufficient numbers of police, prosecutors,
tough trial judges, and prisons. But at the top of our criminal jus-
tice system sits the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court con-
                                       19

cocts ingenious theories and rules to help criminal defendants and
criminal convicts as it began to do in one case after another under
the Warren Court, the cumulative effect of these pro-criminal-
rights decisions is felt in our Nation's streets and in our subways. I
think Judge Souter's experience as a State trial judge, having seen
and sentenced criminals with a first-hand knowledge of the harm
they caused will provide a useful perspective to the High Court.

  Let me note that a nominee's legal brief filed on behalf of a
client are available as a review as examples of a nominee's writing
ability and ability as an advocate. Probing a nominee about such
briefs, however, would in my view be a very disturbing develop-
ment. The role of advocate in our legal system is a cherished one.
A client is entitled to a zealous representation regardless of the ad-
vocate's personal views.

  At the Bork hearings, a majority of this committee, and then of
the Senate, sent a clear message to the legal profession--be careful
about what you say in academic writings. No matter how specula-
tive and even if you change your mind about what you write, your
academic writings will be used against you.

  Will we now witness the misuse of an advocate's legal briefs?
Will this committee send this further message to prospective nomi-
nees: Be careful about which people, which institutions, and which
causes you represent, especially unpopular ones, and be careful
about which arguments you make as an advocate.

  Now, Judge Souter is not running for a political office, nor has
the President nominated him to a policymaking position in the ex-
ecutive branch. He has been nominated for the High Court in a co-
equal branch of the Federal Government.

  In my view, the Constitution clearly gives the President principal
responsibility for judicial selection. As such, the President is enti-
tled to nominate a person who reflects the President's view of the
general role of the judiciary in our tripartite system of govern-
ment. He is not entitled to seek assurance on how a nominee will
vote on a particular issue, or on particular issues.

  The Senate is given a checking function through its advice and
consent power. It does not have the license to exert political influ-
ence on the other branches or to impose litmus tests on nominees.
Nor is the Senate entitled to seek assurances on how a nominee
will decide particular issues that the President, himself, may not
seek.

  As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 76 about the Senate's
advice and consent function in general, the Senate's:

   Concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It
would be an excellent check upon the spirit of favoritism in the President, and
would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State preju-
dice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to populari-
ty.

  In my view, senators are free to ask a nominee any question they
wish, no matter how misleading, abusive, unfair, or foolish. A Su-
preme Court nominee, however, should answer questions related
only to his ethics, competence, legal ability, general view of the
role of the Supreme Court in our Federal system, and independ-
ence of mind. That is, did he make any commitments on issues that
may come before him in order to be nominated or confirmed.

   Judge Souter, I hope you will stand your ground when you sin-
cerely believe you are being asked for answers which you clearly
cannot provide and have the good faith to be able to act as a Su-
preme Court Justice later.

   The Senate should not probe into the particular views of the
nominee on particular issues or public policies, let alone impose
direct or indirect litmus tests on specific issues or cases. If it does,
the Senate impinges on the independence of the judiciary. It politi-
cizes the judging function. The confirmation process becomes a
means to influence the outcome of future cases on issues of concern
to particular Senators. This course is an inappropriate as it would
be for the President to seek such influence, himself. The judiciary
is one branch which should be above politics.

   Judge Souter, we are happy to have you here and we look for-
ward to hearing your testimony. We look forward to getting to
know you better and we look forward to seeing you sit on the Su-
preme Court.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, as you can already see, there is unanimi-
ty on the committee.
   Senator from Ohio, Senator Metzenbaum.
   Senator METZENBAUM. I did not like the fact that you said that
just before you introduced me. [Laughter.]
   The CHAIRMAN. Well, we all follow you, Howard, and that is why
I mentioned you.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWARD M. METZENBAUM

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Souter, there is something reassur-
ing about this hearing. Reassuring in the fact that probably no
other nation in the world has this concept that a President makes
an appointment, nomination, and then the U.S. Senate has the
right, as the peoples' representative to vote up or down on your
confirmation.

  Our Founding Fathers, how they were able to come up with this
structure, I do not know; but I do not know of any other nation
that has that same structure--to their credit. They could not have
known at that time that there is another factor that is in place
now and that is that it is possible for us, as we meet here today, to
open the vista of the American people so that the American people
can hear you respond, hear us inquire of you, so that the American
people can be a part of the process, itself.

  I must say to you that there are many comments and criticism
about how the committee does this or does that, but there is some-
thing wonderful about this entire concept that the President nomi-
nates and the Senate either confirms or refuses to confirm. I feel
privileged to be a part of that process.

  The fact is that you cannot become a member of the Supreme
Court in this country simply because the President and those
around him are comfortable with a nominee's views on the law. We
have an obligation, it is a constitutional responsibility, to make an
independent examination of your constitutional views, your judicial
philosophy, and your approach to law.
                                       21
  We also have a further responsibility and that is to try to deter-
mine, as best we can, what kind of person is Judge David Souter?
This is a different type of nomination from others that we have
had in the past, because it is a fact--although some have chal-
lenged the statement--but it is a fact that when you look at the
record you find little that you have written on many of the critical
constitutional issues which face the Court. Therefore, it makes it
all the more important that we inquire fully into your views on
these subjects.
  But there is probably another, maybe equally as important a
reason, for us to undertake a full and complete inquiry. When the
President nominated you he stated that he did not solicit your
views on any of the controversial issues facing the Court. But just a
day later, John Sununu, his Chief of Staff, went out of his way to
reassure political advocacy groups on the right that Judge Souter
could be counted on to vote with them. Sununu reportedly stated,
that the far right should consider the Souter nomination "a home
run that is just about to leave earth orbit."
  I say to you, frankly, does John Sununu know something which
we, on the committee, do not know and I think we are entitled to
try to learn?
  Much has been said about the impact of your nomination on the
right to privacy and the right of a woman to choose to have an
abortion. I am concerned about that subject, and I will, with appro-
priate questions ask you about these matters. Less has been said
about you in the civil rights issues facing the country. On that sub-
ject, frankly, the nominee's record is practically blank. I believe it
is necessary to ask whether Judge Souter can understand and em-
pathize with the aspirations, the concerns, and the frustrations of
blacks, hispanics, women, minorities. I want to know would you, as
the nominee, have a feel for the conflicts and problems which arise
from our diverse and heterogeneous population?
  Since this nomination, I have had the opportunity to meet with
you, Judge, on two separate occasions; once for over an hour and to
speak with you over the telephone as well. I am frank to say that I
enjoyed those meetings much. I found you to be a thoughtful,
caring, and personable man. I respect your deep feelings for and
commitment to the community in which you were raised.
  Like most of the people who have met you in the last few weeks,
I have no doubt about your legal intelligence nor your legal
acumen. It is clear that you possess a keen legal mind. But I think
most Americans want to know more about the kind of person you
are. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was the subject of a thesis
written by you once wrote that "The life of the law has not been
logic; it has been experience."
  Legal acumen is, indeed, important. But I think many Americans
would not be comfortable with a Judge whose logic and reason
were not tempered by experience and compassion. Judges must un-
derstand and have a feel for the human situations which underlay
the disputes which come before the court. The dilemma faced by an
unwed pregnant teenager; the sting felt by women and minorities
victimized by discrimination; the temptation of the majority to
ignore the consciousness of the religious minorities; or censor on
popular expression.

         39-454--91-
                                                22

  These are not simply abstract, technical matters; they are real-
world controversies whose resolution directly affects the degree of
liberty, fairness, and diversity which Americans enjoy.

  The quality of justice rendered by judges depends upon their ca-
pacity to grasp both the human and legal elements which underlay
the case before them. Do you have that capacity? You are obviously
a community-spirited man and you are obviously a caring human
being. We know that you have devoted considerable time--in some
respects it might be said an unbelievable amount of time--and
energy to the Concord Hospital.

  As you know, I asked you for a list of your charitable contribu-
tions, though I made it clear that I was not interested knowing the
amount of those contributions. I thought that it would give this
Senator some insight into the kind of human being you are. You
were kind enough to share that list with me and I will make that
list available to the Chair and to the public.

  I found that you have given to an impressive variety of groups. I
have a copy of the letter which you sent to me in connection with
that, and unless the Chair has some objection, I would like to place
it in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.
  [The letter of Judge David Souter follows:]

                                                Washington, D.C

                                         September 5, 1990

Dear Ms. Sweitzer:

When I met with Senator Metzenbaum last month, he asked me to provide
information, by letter to you, about the organizations to which I have made charitable
gifts in the recent past and about the policy and practice of a particular organization,
the Mayhew Program, in admitting and serving members of racial minorities. I would
be grateful if you would bring the responses that follow to Senator Metzenbaum's
attention.

During the calendar year 1989 and so far in 1990, I made contributions to the
following organizations:

        Capitol Region Food Program
        United Way of Concord, New Hampshire
        Presiding Bishops' Fund for World Relief
        The Mayhew Program
        Contoocook Valley Counseling Service
        Operation Santa Claus
        St. Andrew's Hurricane Relief Fund
        Shrine Circus Fund
        National Foundation for Cancer Research
        WGBH TV
        The New Hampshire Historical Society
        The Currier Gallery, Manchester, New Hampshire
        Shaker Village
        Museum of Fine Arts
        Harvard College Fund
        Harvard Law School Fund
        Harvard-Radcliff Club of New Hampshire Scholarship Fund
        Phi Beta Kappa
        St. Andrew's Church
        New Hampshire Bar Foundation
        Association of American Rhode Scholars
        Appalachian Mountain Club
        Piscataquog Watershed Association
        The Trust for New Hampshire Lands

The subject of the Senator's second request is the Mayhew Program which operates a
camp on Mayhew Island in Newfound Lake, New Hampshire for boys at risk of
                                              24

trouble. Mayhew's statement of its nondiscrimination policy was adopted in 1974 and
provides that:

        "Mayhew admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all
        the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made
        available to students at Mayhew. Mayhew does not discriminate on the basis
        of race, color, national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational
        admissions, policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other
        school administered programs."

The Executive Director of Mayhew has informed me that in addition to this stated
policy, the Mayhew staff handbook provides that "any form of racism, whether
directed toward a boy, a fellow staff member, or a group in general, has absolutely no
place on Mayhew Island."

The Director has also advised me that according to the 1980 census, New Hampshire
is 98.9% "white, non-hispanic." Despite the state-wide percentage of minorities of
1.1%, such minorities were represented by 6% of the enrollment at Mayhew this
summer, and the Director advises me that this figure is consistent with the average
for the past five years or so. In effect, then, the minority representation at Mayhew
is more than five times that for the state population from which Mayhew's campers
are selected.

                                                         Yours sincerely,

                                                                                                                   t

                                                                 ^fM^0/trtu<iji

  Senator METZENBAUM. On the other hand, in some of your opin-
ions, I am frank to say that you seem to have sprinkled an extra
dose of logic in places where a dash of common sense or compas-
sion would have been, in this Senator's opinion, more appropriate.

  Moreover, having combed through your record as a judge and at-
torney general, I am frank to say that I am hard-pressed to find
many instances in which you broke new ground, provided addition-
al legal protection for the poor, the elderly, minorities, and women.
These are people whose progress in integration in the mainstream
of American life has been aided immeasurably by judges who grasp
the special role which the Supreme Court plays in ensuring fair-
ness and equal dignity for all Americans.

  Frankly, Judge Souter, I do not expect your views on the law and
the Constitution to accord precisely with mine. If they did, Presi-
dent Bush would not have nominated you.

  But the diversity and strength of this Nation depends upon the
Court's willingness to continue to fulfill its role as the guarantor of
individual liberty, equal justice, and fundamental fairness. The
American people need to be sure that you understand that role and
that you are committed to preserving it.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSON

  Senator SIMPSON. Welcome, Judge Souter. Relax now, they have
not rolled out the cannons to the crest of the hill yet. The grape-
shot and the ball have not yet been fired. It will occur. It may
come. You will be ready for that.

  Remember, the best shield to use when that comes, the best
shield to raise before it will be patience, ultimate, blessed patience,
because it will likely get very ponderous, very prolix, very arcane.
Because while we poor souls have been off home in the hustings,
the staff has been burrowing and scratching, and the advisers and
the consultants and the lawyers and the professors on the payroll
are near exhaustion, and all for you, a conservative, an apparent
adherent to constructionism.

  We are here today to learn more about you, in order that the
committee may make a recommendation to our colleagues on your
nomination. What we really need to know here is whether you
have a good legal education and a broad knowledge of the law. We
need to assure ourselves that you are of good moral character and
have a proper judicial temperament.

  We want to know, and quite properly so, whether you as a Jus-
tice will make decisions based upon the law, rather than upon your
own personal, moral, and political views.

  We are certainly not here to determine whether you will decide
the various issues that come before the Supreme Court, as the vari-
ous zealous interest groups may think they should be decided. That
is not the function of this.

  My personal believe, I think a deep belief of most thoughtful
Americans, is that a Justice should be a person of integrity, recti-
                                                   26

tude, intelligence, superior legal scholarship, and proper tempera-
ment for the Supreme Court bench.

  It is also my personal belief, I think shared by many, that a Jus-
tice should have a judicial philosophy of respect for the laws and
the Constitution, a Justice should interpret the laws and uphold
the Constitution, but he or she should not legislate from the bench.

  This is the painful part of this operation for the special interest
groups. They have had free rein in that area for so many years,
and this is a very difficult thing and we must wean them away
from it very carefully, else they be in shock.

  We are hired on in this tripartite form of government to do just
that, to legislate. That is our job. We do that rather imperfectly,
but with good intent, expressed through a pretty able group of
Democrats and Republicans alike. We try.

  From my time with you and from all that I have read and heard,
you surely appear to possess all of these important traits, and I fee1
that you will make a very fine addition to the Supreme Court.

  However, many on the committee, including our able and ener-
getic chairman, have expressed their interest in having your views
on key constitutional issues. I do certainly believe that judicial
nominees should respond to appropriate questions, but overly ex-
plicit questions are not only unwise, but I think even impermissible
from a legal ethics perspective, because you, sir, are a sitting Fed-
eral judge and you are, as a judge, then bound by the Code of Judi-
cial Conduct, and I believe it is vital and critical for all to know
and keep in mind, as we do these proceedings, that canon 3(a)(6) of
that code provides that, "A judge should abstain from public com-
ment about a pending or impending procedure in any court." You
are a judge. This would apply to you.

  We all well know how politicized the abortion issue has become
and we know how hard the purists among the special interest
groups are pushing and pounding and howling to get you to reveal
your views on this topic. But we are also all very well aware that
there will be abortion cases argued before the Supreme Court in
the coming term.

  I happen to be personally prochoice. I deeply believe that women
should have this right, this freedom, this right of privacy, even, if
you will, even though it was stretched like a drum head in Roe v.
Wade, with the use of the words like ''penumbra."

  But extremists on both sides are now controlling that debate, ex-
tremists, and I would humbly suggest that legislators, especially
male legislators, should not even be involved in the decision. But
be sure to read all I have said on that intimate personal issue
before you write. [Laughter.]

  I would also point out to my colleagues that abortion is most
clearly a pending or impending issue before the courts, and I per-
sonally believe that Judge Souter, you, sir, are prohibited from
public comment about that issue, not as a nominee, but as an in-
vested sitting Federal district judge. That is my personal view.

  We heard from our chairman on Tuesday that "questioning di-
rected particularly at issues on which the Court is closely divided
has long been our practice." But let me remind you that in 1981 we
were all admonished by our chairman that "a nominee can speak
in general terms about the law, but should not be forced to state
                                                27

opinions on controversies likely to come before her." That was the
chairman's statement at Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination hear-
ing.

  We were also advised on Tuesday by the chairman that Judge
Souter must answer questions on particular issues, because if he
wants the job, the burden of proof is on the nominee, as it is on us
when we seek election as Senators.

  But in 1981, we were once again admonished by the chairman on
the same Senate floor that the nomination process is "unlike the
situation with respect to Senators, in which the electorate can
demand of us what our philosophic background is or what we think
about a particular issue."

  Let us be very refreshingly candid and honest with each other.
Really, the only thing that has ever long been our practice with
regard to judicial nominations in this arena in these recent years is
politics, pure politics.

  We have a certain and perfect right to inquire about your judi-
cial philosophy, but we do not have the right to know a nominee's
position on specific issues, and certainly not with a sitting judge.

  So, which is it? We cannot have it both ways. Was it true in Sep-
tember 1981, or is it true now in September 1990? Some of the
panting and hand-wringing special interest groups are very dis-
turbed about your quiet lifestyle, the fact that, according to media
reports, you spend much of your time with the law, music, books,
and nature. Good heavens.

  Some even seem to be concerned that you are a bachelor, and it
is even clumsily and desperately suggested that you are somehow
"out of touch" and not in "the mainstream of humanity." It is thus
expressed that a doctor, then, I guess, or a priest or a judge or one
who has not been married and who seeks solitude and contempla-
tion, rather than the excitement and the bright lights is unfit to
counsel, advise, or judge his fellow humans.

  Are we saying that a priest who took the vows of celibacy was
not able to counsel the estranged and anguished wife or husband,
or comfort the tormented child, because he or she had none? That
logic surely diminishes and denigrates the doctrine and process and
practice of several of the world's significant religious orders.

  Well, I would suspect that most thoughtful Americans would like
to take more time to engage in just those pursuits--music, books,
and nature--if they had the ability, in their hurried existence. So,
let us, if nothing else, let us be fair. Let us follow our constitutional
responsibility, as the chairman may see it, as I may see it, deter-
mine whether Judge David Souter has the--this is what the chair-
man asked--whether you have the "intellectual capacity, back-
ground and training, character, and judicial temperament to serve
on the Supreme Court."

  Those are also the words of our chairman. I do know him well. I
know him as a very fair man--I really do--vigorous, energetic, full
of spirit--you are going to get it all--but he is fair.

  You are going to be alright here. In the West we would say, "sit
deep in the saddle," and you will ride it out well.

  The CHAIRMAN. I might say to my colleague from Wyoming,
while those who he said were ensconced here, staff scurrying
through statements, obviously yours was on vacation, because they
                                                     28

did not give you the whole quote. The remainder of the quote was,
"I believe nominees should be required to answer all questions,
except for those questions that would necessitate an opinion as it
applies to a specific set of facts that is likely to come before the
Court for decision." I will be happy to give your staff the rest of the
quote, when we go on.

  Senator SIMPSON. We will put it in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. I now yield to my colleague from Arizona.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DENNIS DeCONCINI

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, another welcome. You will have many and, I sus-
pect, after several days you may wonder what kind of a welcome
the Senate might give you. You are going to have some difficult
days in the sense of being asked a lot of questions.
  A lot of information about your life has already come out, I am
sure some of which you would rather not come out, not that there
is anything embarrassing that I have seen, but we all have our pri-
vate lives, those of us that choose some public service, as you have,
realize that it is part of the price we pay.

  I do not like it all the time and I have had accusations and
things written about me I would rather not have been written, but
I realize that it is part of the process and I suspect that you do, too.
The process demands that we go through exactly what we are
doing today and exactly what the Senator from Wyoming said has
been happening over the last 5 to 6 weeks.

  Yes, people are scratching, people are interested in knowing
about you, because President Bush has nominated you to the posi-
tion of extraordinary importance in our country. Whether one be-
lieves the framers intended it or not, no one can deny the im-
mense power that Supreme Court Justices wield through their
opinions. Decisions by the Supreme Court affect the lives of each
and every one of us every day.

  Whether you label them conservatives or liberals or tag them as
activists or constructionists, Supreme Court Justices are unques-
tionably active participants in the national policymaking. Once the
President appoints and the Senate confirms, a Supreme Court
nominee never has to look back. There are no strings attached, if
you are confirmed here. He or she has been set free to interpret
that great document our Founding Fathers signed over 200 years
ago. Each Justice defines the great ideas of freedom, liberty, and
equality embodied in that Constitution.

  For these reasons, the constitutional responsibility of advice and
consent conferred on the Senate is crucial to our system of govern-
ment and laws. I am sure that no one on this committee or in this
body takes his or her role in this process lightly.

  In nominating Judge Souter to the Supreme Court, I believe
President Bush has chosen an individual with a keen intellect and
solid judicial background. His colleagues speak of his dedication.
Lawyers who appeared before him praise his hard work. The Amer-
ican Bar Association has found that Judge Souter meets their high-
est standards of professional competence, judicial temperament,
and professional integrity, as well.
                                      29
  You have two sponsors, and one of them, Senator Humphrey, sits
on this committee. Senator Humphrey has been an active and well-
respected member of this committee since 1987. Senator Rudman,
his colleague and your close friend, is well respected and liked by
members of this committee and the entire Senate. That goes a long
way, I believe, because it is inportant as to who put you forward, as
well as the President in the White House.
  I was left with some very positive impressions, Judge Souter,
after our office visit over a month ago. I found you to be thoughtful
and a sensitive person. Since that time, I have had a chance to
read a number of your court opinions. These opinions lead me to
believe that you have an open mind and that you will be an open-
minded jurist.
  Judge Souter's opinions, in my judgment, are thoughtful and
well written. Though I did not agree with every one, that is not
why I was reading them. His unique approach to an issue, in cer-
tain cases, reflects great thought on the case before he wrote out
his particular opinion, at least that is my observation. I saw no evi-
dence of any tendency toward carrying out a personal agenda.
  But as important as these attributes are to your confirmation, we
still know very little about you. From all indications, it appears
that President Bush did not apply a litmus test in choosing you for
the Supreme Court. This Senator never has and never intends to
apply such a test. I will not keep a scorecard on the number of
areas upon which I may agree or disagree.
  Instead, I hope to find through these hearings that Judge Souter
is indeed an advocate of judicial restraint and not a judicial activ-
ist. I hope to find a jurist who is respectful of precedent, rather
than a jurist who is on a mission to impose his personal beliefs or
hidden agenda on the country through the broad, sweeping opin-
ions that he may write.
  In the past, some Supreme Court nominees who have come
before this committee have been evasive in answering valid and
what I believed necessary questions posed to them by myself and
my colleagues. I find that practice to be disturbing. Neither this
Senator, nor do I believe any other Senator on this panel, is look-
ing for a nominee to pledge how he or she will vote on specific
cases that may come before the Court.
  We all understand and agree with the need to protect the inter-
ests of future litigants who will appear before you. However, it is
essential that the committee ask and that you, Judge Souter, pro-
vide some answers to questions regarding your judicial philosophy,
your views on constitutional interpretation. To settle for less would
be a great disservice to this body and to this country.
  As I do with all judicial nominees, I presume the President's
nominees should be confirmed and that they are qualified and com-
petent. In my 14 years in the Senate, I have only voted against
three judicial appointments. I have in the past voted for conserva-
tive judges, as well as liberal judges, including recommending Wil-
liam Canby and Mary Schroeder for the ninth circuit, who did not
agree with me on some particularly sensitive issues. But I knew
them and I knew their competence and capabilities.
  Unfortunately, in a practice that is becoming all too common, in-
terest groups are attempting to turn a Supreme Court nomination
                                               30

hearing into a referendum on Roe v. Wade. Those who view these
procedures as just a question of how a nominee will vote on one
case, in my judgment make a mockery of this process.

   If confirmed, Judge Souter, you will serve on the Court long into
the future, as it has been pointed out. Like any other Justice, you
will face countless opportunities to cast a deciding vote on issues
that can shape our society for decades. It is a nominee's ability to
interpret the Constitution for these as yet unforeseen issues that
we must evaluate in this process starting today. Thus, Judge
Souter, your opinion on a particular case is not as important as
your approach to judging and your understanding of the Constitu-
tion.

   Will you be able to separate your personal beliefs from your judi-
cial duties and your constitutional oath? Will you respect the tradi-
tions of precedents of the Court? Will you wield your judicial power
with restraint and respect for the two other branches of govern-
ment? Will you acknowledge that the Constitution should not only
protect the haves, but also the have-nots?

   I hope to be satisfied with the answers to these questions as we
conclude these hearings. I am most favorably impressed with what
I know about you and have read about you. I hope and, quite
frankly, expect, Judge Souter, that you will be forthcoming and
candid in answering my questions and those of my colleagues. I
also hope that after a thorough examination, the committee and
the Senate and this Senator will be able to vote for you. It certain-
ly appears today that that is where we are headed, and I am
pleased that that is how the process is moving.

   In closing, I join my colleagues once again in extending a warm
welcome to you. From what I know of you, it appears that you are
qualified, that you have the education, that there is no question of
your intellectual capacity. And the American people now will have
an opportunity through this democratic process, second to none,
equaled no place that I know of, to get a glimpse at perhaps the
new Justice of the Supreme Court. I hope, Judge Souter, whatever
the questions are, as uncomfortable as they might be, that they are
taken in the spirit of this committee and certainly this Senator as
trying to understand you and fulfill our constitutional responsibil-
ity.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.

    OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. GRASSLEY

   Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   More than 200 years ago, Alexander Hamilton, the architect of
much of what became the judiciary article of the U.S. Constitution,
wrote, and I quote, "the complete independence of the Courts of
justice is * * * essential" in a Republic governed by a "limited
Constitution."
  Hamilton reasoned that the courts, the weakest of the three
branches, must declare the "sense" of the law made by the other
two branches, but if they should be disposed to exercise "will" in-
stead of "judgment," the consequence would be the substitution of
                                       31

their pleasure for that of the democratic bodies and, hence, the
people.

  Unfortunately, over the past 30 years or so, the Federal courts
have exercised more power over a broader range of social and eco-
nomic issues than the framers of the Constitution ever imagined.
Therein, I believe, lies the reason why the confirmation process in
recent years has come dangerously close to looking like the elector-
al process. Unelected and unaccountable judges have come to play
the preeminent role in virtually every aspect of American life--in
many cases supplanting the politically accountable branches of gov-
ernment. This erosion of the principle of the consent of the gov-
erned has, at the same time, undermined public confidence in the
judiciary.

  I have served in the politically accountable branches of govern-
ment--Federal and State--for 32 years. I am looking for a judge
who understands his or her role in a democratic society, to inter-
pret the laws made by others, rather than to second-guess them
based on personalized notions of enlightened social policy. To be
sure, judges have an obligation to enforce the rights guaranteed by
the Constitution. When a law clearly conflicts with that Constitu-
tion, a judge is right to nullify the will of the people. But let us
never forget that perhaps the most fundamental of those rights in
the Constitution is the right of our people to democratic self-gov-
ernment.

  As the second Justice Harlan explained, "the vitality of our polit-
ical system is weakened by reliance on the judiciary for political
reform." The fact is that not every major social ill can find its cure
in a Supreme Court promoting reform when democratic govern-
ment is slow to act--that is, not unless we are to abandon the more
than 200-year-old axiom that the Constitution is an instrument of
government founded on the idea that only in a diffusion of govern-
mental authority lies the greatest promise of the most liberty.

  Therefore, I do not prefer politicians disguised in robes on the
Federal bench, nor ones who are compelled to make campaign
promises to be confirmed. Judges ought not to be "pro-this" and
"anti-that." They should, rather, be judges of cases, not causes.

  As expected, we have heard a great deal about the nature of the
Senate's "advice and consent" role. It is often said--in fact, we
have already heard it this morning--that our role in scrutinizing
and voting on Supreme Court nominees is the most important func-
tion that we have as Senators. This has become some sort of confir-
mation catechism.

  But why is this? Is this process more important than, for exam-
ple, voting to declare war? Is it more important than voting to
solve the budget deficit so that future generations won't be con-
demned to a lower standard of living? Only those who desire the
courts to be more powerful than the coequal branches, or the
States, could answer "yes" to that question.

  Now, true, the framers of the Constitution granted judges life-
time tenure; we are told that this makes all the difference. But
that was to insulate judges from the passing political pressures of
the day, not to make them more susceptible to that pressure.

  It is also asserted that the Senate and this committee in particu-
lar have an equal role in this process, and thus we must scrutinize
                                                 32

the nominee as if we were the President of the United States. In
fact, this nominee has for the past few weeks been studied in great
detail. No stone in his life has been left unturned.

  Until very recently, of course, the historical practice was quite to
the contrary. With only a couple of exceptions, it was not until the
1950's that nominees regularly appeared before this committee. As
recently as 1922, the President nominated and the Senate con-
firmed a Supreme Court nominee on the very same day, a mere 1
day after the vacancy occurred. Of course, only five nominees have
been denied confirmation during the entire 20th century. Now, I
point this out not to advocate a return to the past, but rather to
provide some historical context to our proceedings.

  Similarly, our clear practice has been to refrain from seeking
commitments on specific questions likely to come before the Court.
I think that we would find it quite a paradox on the one hand to
shield judges from political pressures through lifetime tenure,
while on the other hand subject them to the same pressure through
litmus-test questions as a condition for confirmation.

  President Abraham Lincoln put it another way, at the time of
his nomination of Chief Justice Chase: "We cannot ask a man what
he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should
despise him for it." To be candid, I did not always share this view
of the Senate's role. But as with Supreme Court Justices who are
faced with an old precedent, I do not believe that Senators ought to
be forever bound by past practice, particularly when the force of
better reasoning suggests a better way.

  So, Judge Souter, the ultimate question for me is whether
  [Audience disturbance.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the police officers please clear the folks--
the committee will suspend. The committee will stand in recess
until the police can restore order.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come back to order and out
of recess. Welcome to Washington, Judge. [Laughter.]
  You think this is bad, you ought to run for President or run for
the Senate.
  I thank my colleague.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I apologize to everybody for
what I said. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. There is no need to, Senator. I, on that score,
completely concur with you.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I am just about done, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Keep going, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. SO, Judge Souter, the ultimate question for
me is whether you are the kind of judge who will be truly faithful
to our written Constitution and the system of government that it
supports. This quality, together with an open mind--or what Jus-
tice Frankfurter called "the capacity for disinterested judgment"--
is what I hope to find by the time we have completed our question-
ing of you.
  I congratulate you on your nomination, Judge Souter, and I look
forward to hearing from you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Senator. The best part, the most in-
teresting part is, Judge, I don't know why they were for or against.
  Senator Leahy.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK J. LEAHY

  Senator LEAHY. Welcome, Judge Souter. Being from New Eng-
land, I will try not to say anything as inflammatory as Senator
Grassley did. [Laughter.]

  Chuck has a way of stirring us up around here.
  Judge, we do welcome you here, and though there may be a
moment of levity here and there, you know--as we do--the serious-
ness and the importance of this hearing. I think that you as well as
the Senate welcome it, and that you have enough of a dedication to
the Constitution to know its importance for all of us.

  Your nomination comes at a historic time. The individual who
takes a seat on the Supreme Court today is going to have a dramat-
ic impact on that institution, on our Nation well into the next cen-
tury, long after the President and the Members of the Senate are
gone. The 105th Justice to this country's High Court is going to
affect the lives of individual Americans on issues ranging from per-
sonal privacy to equal protection to the free exercise of their reli-
gion. That power is not bestowed on an individual unless and until
the U.S. Senate is confident that he or she will exercise it fairly.

  The Senate's duty to advise and consent to nominations to the
Supreme Court is, in my opinion, one of our most profound and
meaningful responsibilities. It brings together the three distinct
branches of our Government. It proves the wisdom of our system of
checks and balances. The constitutional separation of powers is
envied and emulated by emerging democracies around the world.
In fact, the genius of our Nation's Founders denied the possibility
of tyranny here in the United States, and it did that by devising
our system of checks and balances.

  Now we, the members of this committee, and the rest of the
Members of the U.S. Senate, have to demonstrate our own wisdom
and fairness in undertaking a thorough review of Judge David
Souter's record. The Constitution mandates it. The times demand
it.

  Now, the President has said that this nomination was not subject
to a litmus test and I applaud President Bush for that. He did not
apply a litmus test and I do not apply a litmus test. I do not think
any Senators will do so.

  Look at where we are. Justice Brennan, whose departure precipi-
tated the nomination, viewed the Constitution as a "sparkling
vision * * * of the human dignity of every individual." He never
sacrificed the liberties of the individual--no matter how unpopu-
lar--for the sake of appeasing the majority. Justice Brennan resist-
ed the anti-individual direction the Court has taken over the last
decade. He never lost sight of that institution as the Nation's legal
tribunal of last resort. Justice Brennan's intellect, leadership, and
compassion represented the best of a public servant. His seat on
the Court is immensely difficult to fill.

  Today we consider whether the President should receive the con-
sent of the Senate in the nomination of Judge David Souter. Judge
Souter, you are an articulate and intelligent man with an engaging
                                                    34

sense of humor. In fact, I passed on last night to my son your com-
ments about the motorcycle. He got a laugh out of it, too.

  You also have a strong streak of Yankee individualism. By most
accounts, you are a scholar and have dedicated your life to the law.
Now, those qualities are admirable, but we are all agreed that they
are not enough by themselves to entitle a person to a seat on the
Supreme Court.

  We must be persuaded that Judge Souter has the commitment
and the capacity to preserve the freedoms the American people
have fought for two centuries to protect. Will Judge Souter serve as
a trustworthy guardian of our fundamental rights? I want to be
sure that the next Supreme Court Justice understands the extraor-
dinary nature of the position he or she assumes. That Justice must
never forget, in the words of our great Chief Justice Marshall in
1809, that "it is a Constitution we are expounding"--a Constitution
in a living, breathing, changing society on the threshold of the 21st
century, a Constitution that can fit in this little book, but that has
meant so much for the last 200 years in this country.

  Any nominee to the Supreme Court must recognize that discrimi-
nation is not a high-minded issue about standards of review, but a
daily struggle for minorities and women in this country; that rights
for the disabled are not academic fodder in the debate over federal-
ism, but the opportunity for an individual with a disability to lead
a rich, full life; and that privacy is not an abstraction but a critical
issue for a woman struggling with the dilemma of an unwanted
pregnancy.

  These are not esoteric hypotheticals. They are vitally important
issues that affect the basic principles and fundamental values of
the American people.

  We 100 Members of the Senate, representing 260 million Ameri-
cans, are sworn to uphold the Constitution. That Constitution re-
quires us to offer our advice and consent to the President's nomina-
tion. We are in this body to represent the American people. This
hearing process is how we must satisfy their concerns about a po-
tential nominee. These proceedings are the public's sole opportuni-
ty to assess the qualifications of an individual who could greatly in-
fluence their daily lives. We owe it to the American people to pro-
ceed carefully, thoughtfully, and fairly.

  We will hear from interest groups on both the right and the left,
and that is as it should be. They are exercising their first amend-
ment rights, and very properly so. But my decision will not be in-
fluenced by any group on the left or the right. My decision is going
to be determined really, Judge, based on what I hear from you, in
the answers to my questions and the answers to the questions of
the other members of this committee.

  I have a number of questions--ranging from the first amend-
ment to the right to privacy to Judge Souter's views on criminal
law. In addition, Judge, I will explore fully your involvement in the
Seabrook incident, an issue I have already discussed with you. In
fact, I first raised it with you when I sent you a telegram in 1977,
and we have since talked about it.

  Judge Souter, it is incumbent upon you to be forthcoming in
your responses so that we have an adequate basis on which to
make our recommendation to the full Senate and the American
                                              35

people. That recommendation gets made only once, only once in
your lifetime.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, I join my colleagues in welcoming you here today.
We are giving you a lot of advice. You really have to run between
the raindrops in a veritable hurricane here. But we are very much
concerned about the successor to Justice Brennan because so many
major issues are decided by 5-to-4 votes, and a single Justice can
decide questions of enormous importance to this country. If you are
fortunate enough to be confirmed and to serve as long as Justice
Holmes did, you will serve until the year 2031.

  There has been overriding concern about the abortion question,
and while it is of great moment, there are many other matters of
tremendous importance to this country. We talked about some of
them: Civil rights and freedom of religion and freedom of the press
and freedom of speech and right to die and death penalty as a de-
terrent to violent crime. In looking over next year's docket on the
Supreme Court, there is a major desegregation case. There are
major matters on employment discrimination, taxation, antitrust,
citizenship, death penalty. And even beyond the range of impor-
tance for the United States, the Supreme Court may be called upon
to make a decision which will have international implications as to
what is happening in the Persian Gulf today.

  There is much concern at the moment about the authority of the
President to dispatch U.S. troops under concerns of the War
Powers Resolution with the very vital constitutional provisions on
the President's authority as Commander in Chief contrasted with
the congressional authority, sole prerogative to declare war. Those
are the kinds of issues on which you may be the decisive vote, and
your influence may be greater than many Presidents', certainly
many, many Members of the Senate. So we have very strong rea-
sons to be extremely careful in this very important confirmation
process.

  My reading of several dozen of your opinions tells me that you
have a very extensive record--not a complete record, but a very ex-
tensive record to consider. Some of your opinions are restrictive on
criminal defendants' rights and some are expansive. You have an
opinion on the Dionne case which is candidly very narrow on inter-
pretism and original intent, something that if others don't cover
first I will, about how much emphasis is appropriately placed. That
opinion you cite goes back to matters in 1663 and 1781 and 1768,
and it is narrow. And we will be concerned, I will be concerned,
about how you apply the equal protection clause as to women and
indigents.

  At the same time, your opinion in Richardson has a broad inter-
pretation of the liberty interest in a very difficult case involving a
charge against a man allegedly French-kissing a 14-year-old girl
under his charge. In an employment rights case, you found an ex-
                                               36

pansive liberty interest. And the issue of stare decisis, the fancy
legal word for whether you follow precedent, is very instructive.
One of your opinions says that "The consequences of what I believe
was an unsound conclusion in that case are not serious enough to
outweigh the value of stare decisis," which is an important coun-
terbalance in the law. So I think you have quite a record and we
have very important matters to discuss with you.

  The standards of confirmation are not clear. There has been a lot
of debate on it for a long time, and perhaps it originated with an
early draft of the Constitution which gave to the Senate the au-
thority to appoint. Can you imagine the Senate agreeing on--we
can't agree on a budget, let alone on an appointment.

  We had very interesting hearings on the American Bar Associa-
tion's role, and we all agreed that the ABA should limit itself to
qualifications as opposed to the political question. But there was
considerable opinion that the Senate had equal standing with the
President. I am not prepared to go that far. I think we owe defer-
ence to the President's selection. But, candidly, it is becoming a
complicated matter as the Supreme Court moves farther into
public policy issues and functions as a superlegislature.

  I make no bones about my concern about the Court's expansive
role there, regardless of whose agenda it is. We have a very diffi-
cult matter now pending before the Congress on the Civil Rights
Act interpretation. We had a decision in Griggs, a unanimous
Court. The Chief Justice wrote an opinion in 1971, and it was over-
ruled in 1989 on what is a clear-cut change in law where four Jus-
tices appeared before this committee, put their hands on the Bible,
and made commitments for judicial restraint, to let the Congress
change the law. Now, of course, I speak for myself, my interpreta-
tion here, but I think it was clearly an overruling, burden of proof
on employees and business necessity.

  There is a conclusive presumption of congressional intent when a
case stands for 18 years. If that trend continues, I believe there will
be greater pressure on nominees to answer ultimate questions on
issues of public policy. And you have the important issue on Feder-
al-State rights, and you have Garcia y. National League of Cities,
and I won't go into them now but will later. You have the Chief
Justice and Justice O'Connor saying as soon as we get one more
person we are going to change the law of Garcia. So if the law be-
comes personalized, depending on who is on the Court, then I don't
think it will be possible to restrain Senators from demanding ulti-
mate answers.

  I hope we don't get there because judicial independence requires
that you not make commitments, that the nominee not be asked to
make commitments, and that the decisions be rendered in the tra-
dition of the judicial process, where cases in controversy--that is
what the Constitution says--are decided with specific facts, briefs,
argument, judicial conference, and then a decision. And I do not be-
lieve that any interest group is entitled to a Justice predisposed to
their views any more than a litigant is. They are entitled to some-
one who is qualified and has an open mind and will apply the Con-
stitution.

  The process here today, Judge Souter, I think is the--well, you
might call it the quintessential interaction of the three branches,
                                                     37

where the President nominates, the Senate is called upon to con-
firm or not, and then a Justice takes the Court. When the Constitu-
tion was written, article I was meant for the Congress, article II for
the executive branch, and article III for the Court. And I believe if
the Constitution were to be rewritten today, article I would be for
the Court.

  The Court has taken the dominant authority under our system
in deciding the tough questions, questions of competing authority
between the President and the Congress, questions that may in-
volve the Persian Gulf, the big issues of the day. So that when we
look forward for the next several decades, perhaps four decades,
and we know that the future will hold many 5-to-4 decisions, and
Justice Brennan's successor may pass the key votes on matters of
overwhelming national and international importance, we are very
concerned. And it is an important task we have.

   I think you come to this nomination with fine credentials, and
part of the picture is filled out by your opinions. But there is a
great deal more which we have to find out to make our determina-
tion as best we can whether you should be in the position to cast
that critical vote for so many years on so many issues of tremen-
dous importance.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
   The distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN

   Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, once again, our Nation stands at
a crossroads, a constitutional crossroads, as the President nomi-
nates and the Senate, through its elected membership, must under
our Constitution "advise and consent" on the nomination of Judge
David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Our task is important, for
the future course of the constitutional jurisprudence of this Nation
could rest upon the collective judgment of this Senate.

   In the Supreme Court term ending this year, 1990, 38 out of a
total of 129 written opinions were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. It is my
belief that the American public deserves a Justice who evidences a
clear commitment to basic constitutional values.

   I ascribe wide latitude in our President's right to nominate who
he chooses, especially with regard to a nominee's qualifications, in-
tegrity, and judicial temperament. These are all hallmarks of a
good judge. I believe that all Presidents have endeavored to select
nominees that meet these qualifications.

   I further believe that Presidents have the right to nominate indi-
viduals that belong to the President's political party and that pos-
sess his political and philosophical views, even if they differ from
the views of most of a Senate controlled by another party. Howev-
er, our Founding Fathers felt that such a Presidential right to ap-
point judges should not be unlimited, and provided a check and bal-
ance by requiring a role for an element in the legislative branch.
That check and balance is the Senate confirmation process.

   Historically, the rejection of Presidential nominees has rarely
been exercised. Usually, when it has been exercised, arguments for
good cause have been made. Nevertheless, the confirmation process
                                          38

is a constitutional mandate, and for good reason. Federal judges,
once confirmed, are not subordinate to the President nor the U.S.
Congress. They are members of a coequal branch of our Federal
Government and hold their jobs for life, not subject to the political
processes as we in the executive and legislative branches are.

   Therefore, I also believe that the Senate, as an independent body,
in exercising its constitutional mandate to advise and consent,
must peel beneath the veneer of a nominee to try and better ascer-
tain what role that person intends to play as an Associate Justice
on the highest court in this great Nation.

   Judge Souter, this committee will do a lot of peeling beneath
your veneer, for you are, indeed, a stealth nominee. It is thought
by many that little is known about your reasoning process, think-
ing, and predictability of how you would decide certain issues that
are expected to come before the U.S. Supreme Court. While you
left a paper trail in the 219 opinions you wrote as a member of the
New Hampshire Supreme Court, there are few blips on the radar
screen on the major issues that will face the Supreme Court of the
United States in the upcoming crossroad years. So peel we must.
But we must do this in a fair and impartial manner, and certainly
not cause you to prejudge an issue or a case without benefit of
briefs, arguments, and research on the issue of the case in point.

  It is our constitutional role to probe, cautiously but firmly and
fairly, any s nominee on his or her past actions as a public official;
his or her general views on political, economic, or social issues
facing our Nation; his or her views on how, as a judge, he or she
might expect to approach the analysis of a case in general; and, fi-
nally, his or her judicial philosophy. To do less would be a derelic-
tion of our responsibility to the American public and to the consti-
tutional process by which the President is "advised."

  I believe the majority of the American public supports the con-
cept of judicial restraint--that is, judges who will interpret the
U.S. Constitution, respect prior decisions, and give presumptions to
the validity of laws passed by the Congress and State legislatures,
so long as they do not violate the U.S. Constitution.

  I believe the people of our Nation do not want to see a Justice
appointed who will try to legislate from the bench. Nor does the
public wish to see a judicial extremist of either the right or the left
who would proceed to force his or her peculiar political ideology
through opinions rendered by the highest court in the Nation. Ex-
tremism is a dangerous commodity, and we on this committee have
a duty to the American people to guard against this in any such
potential nominee.

  Given these facts and acknowledging the critical nature of the
task before us, Judge Souter, I welcome your appearance before our
committee today and look forward to your comments through a
dialog with the members of this committee.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  We would ordinarily go to Senator Humphrey next, but he has
indicated that he is going to waive his opening statement because
he will be joining Judge Souter when we conclude our statements
to introduce Judge Souter, along with his senior colleague, Senator
Rudman.
                                          39

  Now I yield to Senator Simon from Illinois.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PAUL SIMON

  Senator SIMON. The good news, Judge Souter, is we are getting
near the end of this part of the process.

  As my colleagues would tell you, I do not ordinarily prepare a
written statement. In fact, in 6 years on this committee, I don't be-
lieve I have ever done that. But last night, late last night, I sat
down at my old manual typewriter and pounded out my reflections
on where we are right now.

  No task is more awesome than the one we now confront--approv-
ing or disapproving a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. Seven
months ago, I became a grandfather for the first time. Perhaps no
vote I cast this term in the Senate will have a greater impact on
my granddaughter's future, Judge Souter, than whether I decide
for or against your nomination.

  After reading your opinions and various writings, even including
your senior honors thesis, I come away with some uneasiness. Can-
didly, I am not sure how to vote.

  In your senior honors thesis, you wrote about a struggle in the
philosophy of law, and I quote: "I cannot offer a solution to the
controversy. I have tried, rather, to describe the alternatives which
are open in settling what I believe to be the most important point
at issue." In the only article you wrote over the next quarter centu-
ry, you paid tribute to Justice Laurence Duncan in the New Hamp-
shire Bar Journal for his sense of what is appropriate on the
bench; for his keen sense of words; for his attention to the small
things--but hardly a hint about any judicial philosophy that moti-
vated him. And then at the end of the article, you say, and I quote:
"He was my kind of judge. He was an intellectual hero of mine,
and he always will be." But after reading your article, I have no
idea what his philosophical moorings were, nor what yours are.

  Because David Souter may have such an influential voice in the
destiny of this Nation, we must know a little better who the real
David Souter is. I hope these hearings will assist in that, and I
hope you will make every effort to help us.

  What am I looking for? The two essentials I mentioned to you in
your visit to my office: I want a champion of basic civil liberties,
because the Supreme Court must be the bastion of liberty; and I
want someone who will champion the cause of the less fortunate,
the role assigned to the Court in our system.

  I also want someone to whom every American can look and say,
"There is a champion of my liberty." That should be true of men
and women, for the able and the disabled, for people of every reli-
gion and color and national background and station in life. That is
an extremely high standard, but it is an extremely high court to
which you aspire.

  During these hearings I also want to get some sense of whether
David Souter has an ability to grow. The great Justices were not
suddenly great Justices, any more than great Senators are sudden-
ly great Senators. Great Justices and great Senators emerge gradu-
ally.
                                               40

   There are those who are concerned because you come from a
small New Hampshire community of 2,000. Coming from an Illinois
community of 402, that does not bother me. But if your intellectual
and emotional horizons are bounded by that community that would
bother me. Checking your background I talked to an African-Amer-
ican classmate of yours, now practicing law in this city. His com-
ments about you were positive. He allayed some of my fears. But I
also want to know if you empathize with a woman on the west side
of Chicago who did not go to Harvard, who barely made it through
the fourth grade. You will be her voice for justice. Is there some
understanding of her plight? Will there be an attempt on your part
to grow and understand our society with all its richness and diver-
sity and with all its joy, often within sound of its cries of anguish
and hopelessness?

  In a new book, Justice Richard A. Posner of the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals has written, "Our legal certitudes are pragmati-
cally rather than analytically grounded." He was speaking of
Brown v. Board of Education when he wrote that. From case to
case his statement may not be applicable, but in the broad sweep of
history it is. When the Supreme Court has lacked vision or compas-
sion or practicality or passion for liberty, as in the Dred Scott case,
the Nation has paid a terrible price for the Court's shortcomings.

  Above the entrance to the Supreme Court, just a few steps from
where we meet today, are the words etched in stone "Equal Justice
Under Law." I want those words to live. And I want a Supreme
Court Justice who will make them live.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Senator.
  Senator Humphrey did wish to make a brief statement?
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome, Judge Souter.
  Are you having fun, yet? I hope so. You might as well enjoy it.
  Mr. Chairman, I have the honor and privilege of formally intro-
ducing the nominee to the committee in just a few moments, so I
will, for my part, at this juncture pass on an opening statement.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  I misspoke. I made Senator Rudman the senior Senator and he is
not. He is the junior Senator. Senator Humphrey is the senior Sen-
ator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. He is senior in age.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS Senator Baker used to say, I do not have any
dog in that fight. I understand.
  So, Senator Kohl, from Wisconsin.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERBERT KOHL

  Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I am a person who has not sat through any Supreme Court nomi-
nations before and I think Judge Souter, you would agree with me
that these opening statements--although we are probably all
happy they are coming to a conclusion--have been most outstand-
ing and say something unusual about our American system and
the way in which we go about selecting Supreme Court Justices.
                                      41
  Judge Souter, the President of the United States has asked you
to serve on the Supreme Court. And if confirmed, you will be
making decisions which will shape the fabric of American society
for the rest of your life. You will be interpreting the Constitution
in which, we as the people, place our faith and on which our free-
doms as a nation rest.
  During your tenure on the Court you will be free of all political
constraints, unaccountable to the people, and unrecallable by the
Congress--absent some severe dereliction of duty. Before we place
that power in your hands, we need to know what is in your heart
and in your mind.
  While the issues the Court must address are well known, your
views are not. Indeed, some cynics have even suggested that you
were nominated precisely because you have not spoken to those
issues in any detail. They even implied the President believed that
a nominee would be more easily confirmed if his views were largely
unknown. Those cynics do not understand, as I am sure the Presi-
dent does understand, the role of the Senate in this process.
  The Constitution requires us to give our advice and consent to
this nomination. The oath of office we took obligates us to examine
your fitness to serve on the Supreme Court. We must conclude that
the quality of your thinking deserves our respect, that you will
relate the law to the basic values we have embraced as a nation,
and that you are interested in doing justice as well as giving logic
to the law.
  In this process, a number of groups have told us to use this hear-
ing to determine your views on one single issue or another, and
they have told us that our decision to confirm you ought to depend
on whether you pass their litmus test.
  Well, let me add my own personal single-issue litmus test to the
mix; and that is judicial excellence. Judicial excellence, it seems to
me, involves at least four elements. First, a nominee must possess
the competence, character, and temperament to serve on the
bench. He or she must have a keen understanding of the law, and
the ability to explain it in ways that the American people will un-
derstand. Based on the record developed thus far, Judge Souter,
certainly you appear to have those qualifications.
  Second, judicial excellence means that a Supreme Court Justice
must have a sense of the values which form the core of our politi-
cal and economic system. No one, including the President, has the
right to require ideological purity from a member of the Supreme
Court. But we do have a right to require the nominee to under-
stand and respect our constitutional values. We do not elect Jus-
tices. They do not have the representational role that Members of
Congress have.
  The Framers of the Constitution gave the Supreme Court Jus-
tices lifetime tenure for a reason--they wanted the Court to be in-
sulated from the momentary pull and tug of our daily politics. We
do not want Justices who will change their legal opinions as the
tide of public opinion turns. Indeed, we charge the Court with the
task of defending the rights established in the Constitution even if
those rights are, for the moment, reviled.
  In my opinion, that means that a Supreme Court Justice must,
at a minimum, be: Dedicated to equality for all Americans, deter-
                                              42

mined to preserve the right of privacy and the right to be left alone
by the Government, committed to civil rights and civil liberties, de-
voted to ensuring the separation of church and state; willing to
defend the Bill of Rights and its applications to the States against
all efforts to weaken it, and able to read the Constitution as a
living, breathing document.

  Third, judicial excellence requires a sense of compassion. The law
is more than an intellectual game, and more than a mental exer-
cise. As Justice Black said, "The Courts stand against any winds
that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer
because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are
non-conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement."

  Indeed, the courts are our refuge, our sanctuary, and our safe
haven. The courts are where people seek justice, not just the appli-
cation of law. A Supreme Court Justice must understand that. He
or she must recognize that real people, with real problems are af-
fected by the decisions rendered by the Court. They must have a
connection with and an understanding of the problems that people
struggle with on a daily basis. Justice, after all, may be blind, but
it should not be deaf.

  And finally, judicial excellence requires candor before confirma-
tion. We are being asked to give you enormous power. We want to
know, in general, how you will exercise it. We want to know what
you think about certain issues--abortion and privacy, civil and in-
dividual rights, the balance of power and separation of church and
state. We do not want to know in advance how you will rule on
cases that will come before you, but we do want--and we need and
we deserve--to know what you think about these basic issues.

  Judge Souter, let me be presumptuous enough to give you just a
bit of advice. Do not hedge. Do not give us prepared answers. Do
not hide behind the argument that you cannot talk about this or
that. We are not trying to trap you and we are not trying to obtain
a commitment from you about how you will vote. But, Judge, I be-
lieve you have thought about the great issues of the day and I be-
lieve you have some views on them, and I do not believe that those
views will require you to vote in any specific way. I trust your abil-
ity to remain openminded about the specifics that may come before
you. But I believe the country is entitled to know, before you take
a seat on the Court and tell us ex-cathedra, how you view basic
constitutional doctrine.

  On behalf of the American people, we will be having a conversa-
tion with you over the next few days. If you are confirmed it is the
last conversation we can have about basic constitutional issues. So,
in these next few days, we must make an extra effort to get to
know you and you must make an extra effort to help us do that.

  The burden of proof rests on you, and only you can discharge it.
Let me conclude on this note. Much of this hearing will focus on
facts, but behind all of this is a sense of mystery. The Supreme
Court is one of the most majestic institutions in American life. By
its nature, the Court makes decisions which people oppose, but so
far it has had the moral standing to compel compliance with those
decisions, no matter how unpopular they are.

  We have made a covenant with the Court; we have given it the
power to make ultimate decisions and in return, asked the Court to
                                                    43

exercise that power responsibly. As Justice Stone once observed,
and I quote, "The only check upon our own exercise of power is our
own sense of self-restraint."

  This hearing will help us to determine, as a Congress and as a
country, how Judge Souter intends to exercise that power and that
restraint.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Senator.
  Now, Judge, what I propose to do before we break is to have our
two distinguished colleagues, both of whom strongly favor your
nomination, join you at the table. I will ask the senior Senator,
Senator Humphrey, to speak first, and then Senator Rudman. At
which time, after that is done, Judge, with your permission, unless
you would prefer to do it another way, I would suggest that we
break; we will come back; I will swear you in and we will hear
your opening statement and then begin the questioning.
  Is that all right with you?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Humphrey.

          STATEMENT OF SENATOR GORDON J. HUMPHREY

  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  With my colleague, Senator Rudman, I take pride in introducing
to the Judiciary Committee, Judge David Souter, of Weare, NH.
  I have to, because we are so very proud of our State, I have to
correct my dear friend from Utah, it has not been 145 years since
someone from our State sat on the Supreme Court. In fact, Chief
Justice Harlan Fiske Stone was born in New Hampshire in the
town of Chesterfield and he served, of course, until his death in
1946.

  The uninformed suggest that David Souter is from a small town.
Well, Mr. Chairman, I think perhaps you are better informed on
this point than others, because you visited our State extensively
drawn by its natural beauty and conservative politics. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. I wish I had been able to stay longer. [Laughter.]
  Senator HUMPHREY. SO do we. Drawn as you are by its natural
beauty and conservative politics, but the uninformed, Mr. Chair-
man, think that David Souter is from a small town. Nothing, in
fact, could be further from the truth, because where is a town so
very large in area that it has no less than five separate metropoli-
tan centers? There is the village of Weare, itself; there is East
Weare, from which the Judge hails; there is South Weare; by now
you might have guessed there is a West Weare; and, in fact, in the
north, Mr. Chairman, is the village, which is sometimes abbreviat-
ed on signs as No. Weare, and sometimes pronounced by tourists as
Nowhere.
  But we do not mind tourists laughing at our signs, or even laugh-
ing at us, as long as they spend all of their money before they go
home because that helps to keep down our taxes.
  Mr. Chairman, the elegant pundits here, inside the beltway,
think that David Souter may not be quite up to the big city or the
big time because he drives a clunky old car, because he believes in
conserving energy by not mowing his lawn until the grass begins to
                                                    44

block his view from the window. They think maybe a small-town
fellow is not good enough for the big city of Washington, DC.

  Well, my dear colleagues, I believe that you will find David
Souter to be as smart as anyone in this city. I believe you will find
him to be as sophisticated as anyone living up in Georgetown. I
think you will find that he has a wonderful sense of humor. That
he does not take himself too seriously.

  On that point, I want to quote from a letter sent to the New
York Times, and published in the New York Times by William
Bardell who was a law school classmate of David Souter's and a
fellow Rhodes scholar during their student days.

  He says, "What I remember is David very gentlemanly, with his
hands in the pockets, telling stories especially with his imitations
of New England accents." He added, "I am pretty sure also that he
climbed in a few windows with me after midnight when they
locked the college gates."

  Mr. Chairman, I believe that our colleagues will find that David
Souter enjoys the company of others every bit as much as he enjoys
the company of his famous collection of books on history, philoso-
phy, and the law.

  Here is a man who works hard, yes, very hard, in a very disci-
plined way. But he is a man who also, for example, enjoys stopping
by to visit older folks on his way home from weekly worship. He is
an admirable human being.

  On the professional side, for 22 years, David Souter has faithfully
gone about the business of enforcing the law, and dispensing sound
justice. He has enforced the law as our State's attorney general. He
has presided over jury trials as a superior court judge, and he has
served with distinction on our State's highest court, the supreme
court.

  Judge Souter's selfless commitment to public service surely tells
us something about the qualities, the human qualities that he
would bring to the Supreme Court. With his sterling credentials, as
a graduate of Harvard Law School and as a Rhodes scholar at Ox-
ford's Magdalen College. Every one of us knows that he could have
been earning millions these past years as a partner in a prestigious
firm in Boston or New York, but instead, he has devoted himself to
positions of very high responsibility, but rather modest financial
compensation. Shunning personal aggrandizement and self-promo-
tion, he has found his compensation, instead, in pursuing the inter-
est of justice in the public good.

  But the best measure, surely the best measure is the opinion of
those who know him best. In a close-knit State like ours, anyone
who has been in public service as long as as David Souter is well-
known by people across the State. So it is especially revealing that
folks of all political persuasions, Republicans and Independents,
Conservatives and Democrats, women, men have offered high
praise for Judge Souter's fairness, for his fairness, for his diligence,
and his grasp of the law.

  Support and respect for Judge Souter among members of the
legal profession in our State has been virtually unanimous and let
me read a few brief quotes. The New Hampshire Bar Association
president, John Broderick--who is, by the way, a Democrat--says
this: "He is the finest legal mind I have ever encountered. He gets
                                                   45

to the bottom line faster than anybody I have ever seen." He adds,
"He is a judge's judge, extraordinarily talented and impeccably
fair. He will not cast his lot with the conservatives on the Court
merely because they are conservatives. He is fiercely independent
in his legal reasoning."

  Kathy Green, president of the New Hampshire Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, who has tried many cases before Judge
Souter, says this: "He was an excellent trial judge, though he was
the kind of judge you knew was really going to hammer people at
sentencing."

  "I am a Liberal/' Green concluded, "but I have tremendous re-
spect for Judge Souter. I think he will honor the Constitution."

  Paul McKechern, a well-known political activist, candidate for
Governor, a Democrat, past president of the New Hampshire Bar
Association says this: "My impression is that he is a first-rate
scholar. He is going to be confirmed and deservedly so."

  Finally, a resolution passed by the New Hampshire Bar Associa-
tion unanimously adopted and I will just read the resolve clause:

  Be it resolved that the New Hampshire Bar Association on behalf of its 3,400
members, acting through its Board of Governors, unanimously and enthusiastically
supports and endorses the nomination of David Souter and proudly commends its
respected member for confirmation to the Federal Bench by the United States
Senate.

  Mr. Chairman, David Souter is well seasoned. This is interesting:
No current member of the Supreme Court had the breadth of judi-
cial experience at the time of nomination as Judge Souter has, as
both a trial and appellate judge. Two of the Justices now on the
Court had no judicial experience at all when nominated. Five of
them had varying amounts of experience as appellate judges, but
none as a trial judge, and only Justice O'Connor had both trial and
appellate experience when she joined the High Court, but then not
nearly as much as Judge Souter.

  By any measure, then, Judge Souter is ideally prepared to serve
on the Supreme Court. He has been actively engaged in the trench-
es, rather than offering commentary and criticism from the side-
lines. Judge Souter's 12-year judicial record is there for all to see,
and it provides the strongest possible proof of his judicial excel-
lence.

  This point was expressed well by Prof. Joseph Grano, a distin-
guished professor of law at Wayne State University Law School,
who in a detailed report he prepared on Judge Souter's opinions in
the criminal law area, said this:

   From the cases I reviewed, I can find no legitimate basis for either side of the
political spectrum opposing this intelligent jurist. Of course, those who want poli-
tics, rather than law from the Supreme Court, those few, Justice Souter is not the
right person. For those who know better, it should be evident that President Bush
has made an excellent selection.

  Mr. Chairman, it is a credit to Judge Souter's spotless record
that the critics have resorted now to the game of "trivial pursuit"
in their efforts to find something negative to write about. Frustrat-
ed in their search for a smoking gun, some pundits have lamely
suggested that a scholarly bachelor somehow lacks the perspective
to be a good Supreme Court Justice.
                                                     46

   Such critics need to be reminded that one of the Nation's most
eminent and humane Justices, the great Benjamin Cardozo, was a
scholarly bachelor. As always, my colleagues, we need persons
marked by fairness, wisdom, and self-restraint sitting on the bench.
Judge Souter fits that description in every way.

   President Bush has made an excellent nomination. I am honored,
therefore, to introduce him to my colleagues on the Judiciary Com-
mittee and confident that he will leave them impressed in every
way.

   Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator, for a thorough and enter-
taining and informative opening statement.
   Senator Rudman.

    STATEMENT OF HON. WARREN B. RUDMAN, A U.S. SENATOR
                 FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

   Senator RUDMAN. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and my col-
leagues on the committee, it is a very rare event in a public career
that one has the opportunity to recommend a close and dear per-
sonal friend, as well as a former colleague for the highest position
the legal profession offers, that of Associate Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court.

  Therefore, this is a very special privilege for me personally, be-
cause more than 20 years ago, when I was attorney general of New
Hampshire, I first met a young lawyer named David Souter and,
like many, I recognized that this was a rare man, of great talent
and extraordinary capacity for legal analysis, and quiet strength.

  We worked together for 6 years, but more importantly, we have
been friends for 20. So, I do feel qualified, not only to introduce this
nominee to the committee with my colleague Senator Humphrey,
but also to discuss his enormous capability, his accomplishments,
and his humanity.

  David Souter, throughout his distinguished career, has demon-
strated that he possesses the intellectual judicial temperament, the
personal qualities that will make him an outstanding addition to
the Court.

  His scholastic credentials we have already heard, Harvard, the
Rhodes scholarship, Harvard Law School, and the positions in
public life. But his personal credentials are equally impeccable--
fairminded, considerate, eventempered, warm, and compassionate.
It speaks volumes that the consensus in New Hampshire, from law-
yers, judges, Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives, is
that David Souter is eminently qualified for the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  As a member of the superior court, the trial court of general ju-
risdiction of the State of New Hampshire, David Souter witnessed
the panorama of life. As a trial court judge, he dealt with the
gritty and oftentimes unappealing cases which, unfortunately,
packed the docket and comprise a part of American life today.

  He presided over cases involving the full range of people who
comprise our society, from the poorest to the most affluent. As a
trial court judge, he confronted cases of violent crimes, the scourge
                                                   47

of drugs, economic disputes, family conflicts, and crimes of passion.
In short, Mr. Chairman, David Souter has seen it all.

  When you speak to those who appeared before David Souter in
his capacity as a trial judge, his fairness and even-handedness in
the administration of justice is cited by all.

  On the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Judge Souter demon-
strated that he is a classic conservative. Judge Souter respects
precedent, applies the law to the facts before him, without prede-
fined conclusions. He is committed to the application of the tradi-
tional rules of statutory construction and constitutional interpreta-
tion, and recognizes the proper role of judges in upholding the
democratic choices of the people through their elected representa-
tives.

  As recently as April 13, 1990, Judge Souter wrote, as a member
of that court, "The basic scheme of the Constitution is a limitation
of powers. Government is limited and courts and legislatures can
only do what they are authorized to do."

  Judge Souter's opinion are admired for their crispness, their
strength of reason, for their clarity, and for the intellectual attain-
ment they demonstrate. His record makes clear his commitment to
the rule of law, his full understanding of judicial restraint and
precedent. I believe that his judicial philosophy reflects the think-
ing of the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, as expressed in
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway v. May. That quote says,

  Great constitutional provisions must be administered with caution. Some play
must be allowed for the joint of the machine, and it must be remembered that legis-
latures are the ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite
as great a degree as the courts.

  I know how carefully the members of this committee and your
staff have worked to assess this nomination. I know that your ex-
change with David Souter will be enlightening and comprehensive,
as it should be. I think you will find a first-rate legal mind, a
writer of great precision and force, a jurist of uncommon quality,
who brings no agenda, no ideology to the bench, only a single-
minded commitment to serve justice in the greatest traditions of
American jurisprudence.

  Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and members of this commit-
tee, I cannot let this moment pass without sharing with you my
own observations of a man I have known and worked closely with
for 20 years. Having sat for 10 years now in your positions at con-
firmation hearings, I know it is customary for a home State Sena-
tor to praise a native nominee. Indeed, I have done that, as we all
have.

  I want to make it clear today that my association with this man
is far beyond that norm. David Souter is my friend. I trust him, I
respect him, and I like him. He has made me think, he has made
me reflect, and he has made me laugh.

  When I became attorney general, our office was small. I recog-
nized its potential to make a difference for the citizens of our State.
To realize this potential, I needed to invigorate the office with new
talent and new energy. David joined me in that task and succeeded
me as Attorney general of our State.

  He oversaw the expansion of the attorney general's office during
my tenure and his own. He did so by recruiting a staff of young,
                                       48
able, dedicated lawyers and then reared them to maturity. He
hired on the basis of talent alone, no political, no philosophical
tests. We soon boasted a staff that was the envy of law firms in
that State. Today, those lawyers have led distinguished careers in
their own right. A number are familiar to the members of this
committee. They are judges, public servants, partners in major
firms in our State and beyond.

  To a person, they cite their relationship with the attorney gener-
al's office and David Souter, in particular, as the outstanding expe-
rience of their lives. That is because David did not just hire good
lawyers, he hired good people. Once hired, he showed these people
how a lawyer can and must balance all of the elements of a de-
manding professional career and a personal life. He stressed serv-
ice to State and Nation, but also to your community and to your
family. He brought the office together, not as a cheerleader, but as
an understanding and concerned friend.

  Much has been made of David's New Englandness--I think that
is a word. I am not sure what it means. You do not have to spend
much time in our State or our region at this time to appreciate its
special qualities. I know, Mr. Chairman, that several members of
this committee have had firsthand experiences in New Hampshire.
You know that it is indeed a very special and a very unique place.
But New England and New Hampshire are not just states of mind.
They are real places, where real things happen to real people.

  There is no demographic profile of the perfect judge. The people
who we seek to discharge these responsibilities must have certain
human qualities, not fixed life resumes. I know that David Souter,
shaped by his experiences, knows that judges must understand that
their decisions are not mere academic or scholarly exercises, but,
rather, the best hope of resolving human dilemma.

  Judges must realize that real people are impacted by what they
do, that the essence of judging is its humanity. I am confident that
my friend David Souter knows that.

  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I must say that it is remarkable that
there are some here in Washington who view a man who has a
single-minded dedication to his chosen profession, the law, and pos-
sesses great qualities of humility, graciousness, frugality, charity,
reverence to his faith and to his family is somehow regarded as an
anomaly and somehow out of touch with life. I believe that most
Americans see these as endearing and desirable qualities, all too
often sacrificed in the frenetic pace of modern life.

  In closing, Mr. Chairman and Senator Thurmond, allow me to
suggest that we in New Hampshire are enormously proud to sit
here today and have David Souter appear before this distinguished
committee on the occasion of his confirmation hearings to our Na-
tion's highest court.

  His life has been rooted in our rocky soil and nurtured by a life-
long commitment to public service. I present to you a good person,
one who will bring honor to the Supreme Court and to our consti-
tutional system, with enthusiasm and with deep personal convic-
tion. I urge your favorable consideration of a dear friend and a de-
serving nominee.

  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
                                          49

  Judge Souter, you are a lucky man to have a friend like that,
two friends, and we take their recommendations seriously and to
heart.

  Now, what we will do, Judge, if it meets with your approval, is
we will recess until 2 p.m., at which time we will come back, swear
you in, and begin the hearing.

  We will recess until 2 p.m.
  [Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the committee was in recess, to recon-
vene at 2 p.m., the same day.]

                                         AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, would you please stand to be sworn? Do you swear that
the testimony you are about to give will be the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?
  Judge SOUTER. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. We are going to wait a moment while the pho-
tographers have an opportunity to leave and get their lunch or
whatever they would like to do. They are very angry with me.
  [Pause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back to the hearing, Judge Souter. As I
indicated before we left, we would welcome any opening statement
you have to make for as short or as long as you wish to make it.
Then we will begin with questions.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. DAVID H. SOUTER, TO BE ASSOCIATE
    JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I probably should
begin by asking you if you can hear me as well as I can hear you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, we can, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and other
members of the committee, as you know, I did not ask to make a
formal and preprepared statement, but I would like to accept your
invitation to say a few words before our dialog together does begin.
  I would like to start maybe in a very obvious way simply by
saying thanks for some things, to begin with, to thank every
member of this committee who, in the waning and the very hectic
days that you went through prior to the summer recess, nonethe-
less found some time to see me when I came by to meet you, in
most cases for the first time. I was grateful for the reception and
the courtesy that every one of you gave to me.
   Equally obviously, I would like simply to say here what I have
already said privately this morning, or at least quietly this morn-
ing, in thanking both Senator Humphrey and Senator Rudman for
their generosity to me in their introduction and their sponsorship
of me before you. And I will have to continue, as I have been trying
to do for the past 7 or 8 weeks now, to say some adequate thanks to
the President of the United States for the confidence that he
showed in me in making that nomination. I have not succeeded in
doing that adequately yet, but I will keep trying.
  In fact, I came to the notice of probably most of you on this com-
mittee when I stood next to the President and tried--again, with
great difficulty--that afternoon in late July to express some sense
                                               50

of the honor that I felt, despite the surprise and even shock of the
event to me. It is equally incumbent on me to try to express some
sense of the honor that I feel today in appearing before you, as you
represent the Senate of the United States in discharging your own
responsibility to review the President's nomination. I could only
adopt what Senator Metzenbaum said earlier this morning about
the grandeur of this process of which we are a part.

  I mentioned to you the great surprise that I had on July 23 in
finding myself where I was. I certainly found very quickly that I
had no reason to be surprised at the interest which the United
States and, actually, a good deal of the world suddenly took in me
as an individual. And despite the reams of paper and I suppose the
forests that have fallen to produce that paper in the time between
July 23, I would like to take a minute before we begin our dialog
together to say something to you about how I feel about the begin-
nings that I have come from and about the experiences that I have
had that bear on the kind of judge that I am and the kind of judge
that I can be expected to be.

  I think you know that I spent most of my boyhood in a small
town in New Hampshire--Weare, NH. It was a town large in geog-
raphy, small in population. The physical space, the open space be-
tween people, however, was not matched by the interspace between
them because, as everybody knows who has lived in a small town,
there is a closeness of people in a small town which is unattainable
anywhere else. There was in that town no section or place or
neighborhood that was determined by anybody's occupation or by
anybody's bank balance. Everybody knew everybody else's business,
or at least thought they did. And we were, in a very true sense,
intimately aware of other lives. We were aware of lives that were
easy, and we were aware of lives that were very hard.

  Another thing that we were aware of in that place was the re-
sponsibility of people to govern themselves. It was a responsibility
that they owed to themselves, and it was a responsibility that they
owed and owe to their neighbors. I first learned about that or I
first learned the practicalities of that when I used to go over to the
town hall in Weare, NH, on town meeting day. I would sit in the
benches in the back of the town hall after school, and that is where
I began my lessons in practical government.

  As I think you know, I went to high school in Concord, NH,
which is a bigger place, and I went on from there to college and to
study law in Cambridge, ME, and Oxford, England, which are
bigger places still. And after I had finished law school, I came back
to New Hampshire, and I began the practice of law. And I think
probably it is fair to say that I resumed the study of practical gov-
ernment.

  I went to work for a law firm in Concord, NH, and I practiced
there for several years. I then became, as I think you know, an as-
sistant attorney general in the criminal division of that office. I
was then lucky to be deputy attorney general to Warren Rudman,
and I succeeded him as attorney general in 1976.

  The experience of government, though, did not wait until the day
came that I entered public as opposed to private law practice; be-
cause although in those years of private practice I served the pri-
vate clients of the firm, I also did something in those days which
                                       51
was very common then. Perhaps it is less common today--I know it
is--but it was an accepted part of private practice in those days to
take on a fair share of representation of clients who did not have
the money to pay.

  I remember very well the first day that I ever spent by myself in
a courtroom. I spent in a courtroom representing a woman whose
personal life had become such a shambles that she had lost the cus-
tody of her children, and she was trying to get them back. She was
not the last of such clients. I represented clients with domestic re-
lations problems who lived sometimes, it seemed to me, in appall-
ing circumstances. I can remember representing a client who was
trying to pull her life together after being evicted because she
couldn't pay the rent.

  Although cases like that were not the cases upon which the firm
paid the rent, those were not remarkable cases for lawyers in pri-
vate practice in those days before governmentally funded legal
services. And they were the cases that we took at that time be-
cause taking them was the only way to make good on the supposed-
ly open door of our courts to the people who needed to get inside
and to get what courts had to offer through the justice system.

  I think it is fair to say--I am glad it is fair to say--that even
today, with so much governmentally funded legal service, there are
lawyers in private practice in our profession who are doing the
same thing.

  As you know, I did go on to public legal service, and in the
course of doing that, I met not only legislators and the administra-
tors that one finds in the government, but I began to become famil-
iar with the criminal justice system in my State and in our Nation.
I met victims and sometimes I met the survivors of victims. I met
defendants. I met that train of witnesses from the clergy to con art-
ists who passed through our system and find themselves, either
willingly or unwillingly, part of a search for truth and part of a
search for those results that we try to sum up with the words of
justice.

  As you also know, after those years I became a trial judge, and
my experience with the working of government and the judicial
system broadened there because I was a trial judge of general juris-
diction, and I saw every sort and condition of the people of my
State that a trial court of general jurisdiction is exposed to. I saw
litigants in international commercial litigation for millions, and I
saw children who were the unwitting victims of domestic disputes
and custody fights which somehow seemed to defy any reasonable
solution, however hard we worked at it.

  I saw, once again, the denizens of the criminal justice system,
and I saw domestic litigants. I saw appellants from the juvenile jus-
tice system who were appealing their findings of delinquency. And,
in fact, I had maybe one of the great experiences of my entire life
in seeing week in and week out the members of the trial juries of
our States who are rightly called the consciences of our communi-
ties. And I worked with them, and I learned from them, and I will
never forget my days with them.

  When those days on the trial court were over, there were two ex-
periences that I took away with me or two lessons that I had
learned, and the lessons remain with me today. The first lesson,
                                          52

simple as it is, is that whatever court we are in, whatever we are
doing, whether we are on a trial court or an appellate court, at the
end of our task some human being is going to be affected. Some
human life is going to be changed in some way by what we do,
whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it as appellate
judges, as far removed from the trial arena as it is possible to be.

   The second lesson that I learned in that time is that if, indeed,
we are going to be trial judges, whose rulings will affect the lives of
other people and who are going to change their lives by what we
do, we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and
our beings to get those rulings right.

   I am conscious of those two lessons, as I have been for all of the
years that I was on an appellate course. I am conscious of them as
I sit here today, suddenly finding myself the nominee of the Presi-
dent of the United States to undertake the greatest responsibility
that any judge in our Republic can undertake: The responsibility to
join with eight other people, to make the promises of the Constitu-
tion a reality for our time, and to preserve that Constitution for
the generations that will follow us after we are gone from here.

   I am mindful of those two lessons when I tell you this: That if
you believe and the Senate of the United States believes that it is
right to confirm my nomination, then I will accept those responsi-
bilities as obligations to all of the people in the United States
whose lives will be affected by my stewardship of the Constitution.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge, for a statement
that gives us all more insight into you. When I ended my opening
statement, I said "maybe a little glimpse into your heart," I think
you have given us a little glimpse into your heart as well as how
you view the responsibility you hope to undertake.

  Judge, before I begin my questioning, I want to make it clear to
you that under precedence--we can debate and argue, which we
will up here, about how long they have existed--but under prece-
dence dating back, as one of my colleagues said, at least to the
1950's, and arguably much earlier, each member of the committee
can decide whatever questions he deems proper to ask you. We
have never imposed a gag rule on any committee member.

  But, Judge, while we may ask any questions we deem proper, you
are free to refuse to answer any questions you deem to be improp-
er. No one is going to try to force you to answer any question you
think in good conscience you cannot appropriately address. So,
Judge Souter, I trust you are fully capable of deciding for yourself
which questions you can and cannot speak to. And we or an indi-
vidual Senator may not agree with your decision, but that decision
is yours and will be protected.

  Everyone involved in the process, both the members of this com-
mittee and you, I think have to be guided by the most considered
interpretation of our respective constitutional responsibilities. And
I know from my first discussion with you weeks ago that that was
a judgment, as I think you have said, to paraphrase you, when the
photographs had left my office, and I said "How are you? What are
you looking forward to?" And you said something to the effect:
Going home to New Hampshire to think about how you can appro-
                                                53

priately reveal to us and the Nation your constitutional philosophy
within the limitations you think you are bound by.

  So to clear it up, to state it again, any member can ask anything.
You don't have to answer if you think it is inconsistent with what
your responsibilities are.

  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate that. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Judge, let me begin. You said in your state-
ment, you used the phrase "the promises of our Constitution." That
is the phrase you used, and that is really what I want to discuss
with you--the promises of our Constitution. What does it promise?
Because there are very, very different views held by very bright
women and men, all experts in the law, many incredibly well in-
formed, who have very different visions of what the promises of
our Constitution are.
  Judge, it comes as no surprise to you, as I discussed with you a
little bit yesterday, there is nothing intended that I am about to
ask you that is designed as a surprise, so much to the extent that I
think you were probably surprised yesterday when I told you what
I was going to ask you.
  Judge SOUTER. I was a little bit.
  The CHAIRMAN. And it will not surprise any of the press I see out
there because it is something I care deeply about, and they are
probably tired of hearing me talk about it, but I am going to con-
tinue to talk about it. And as, Judge Souter, a close friend of yours,
and I consider him, quite frankly, a close friend of mine, my col-
league Warren Rudman, has said--he has said many things, but he
has said that Supreme Court
  Judge SOUTER. YOU should have been staying with him for the
last 10 days. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, we each have our own jobs. That is your job,
not my job.
  Judge SOUTER. I realize that.
  Senator HATCH. We live with him every day, let me tell you.
[Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. But he has indicated that one of the Supreme
Court Justices you most admire was the second Justice Harlan,
who served on the Supreme Court between 1955 and 1971, and who
was widely regarded, is widely regarded as one of the great con-
servative Justices ever to serve on the Court.
  Now, Justice Harlan concurred in the Court's landmark decision
of Griswold. That is the Connecticut case that said that the State
of Connecticut, the legislature and the Governor couldn't pass a
law that--constitutionally--said that married couples could not use
birth control devices to determine whether or not they wished to
procreate.
  Justice Harlan indicated that that Connecticut law violated the
due process clause of the 14th amendment which says that no State
can deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without process
of law.
  Now, my question is this, Judge: Do you agree with Justice Har-
lan's opinion in Griswold that the due process clause of the 14th
amendment protects a right of a married couple to use birth con-
trol to decide whether or not to have a child?

       39-454--91-
                                                54

  Judge SOUTER. I believe that the due process clause of the 14th
amendment does recognize and does protect an unenumerated
right of privacy. The

  The CHAIRMAN. And that--please continue. I didn't mean to in-
terrupt. I like what you are saying.

  Judge SOUTER. The only reservation I have is a purely formal
reservation in response to your question, and that simply is: No
two judges, I am sure, will ever write an opinion the same way,
even if they share the same principles. And I would not go so far as
to say every word in Justice Harlan's opinion is something that I
would adopt. And I think for reasons that we all appreciate, I
would not think that it was appropriate to express a specific opin-
ion on the exact result in Griswold, for the simple reason that as
clearly as I will try to describe my views on the right of privacy,
we know that the reasoning of the Court in Griswold, including
opinions beyond those of Justice Harlan, are taken as obviously a
predicate toward the one case which has been on everyone's mind
and on everyone's lips since the moment of my nomination--Roe v.
Wade, upon which the wisdom or the appropriate future of which it
would be inappropriate for me to comment.

  But I understand from your question, and I think it is unmistak-
able, that what you were concerned about is the principal basis for
deriving a right of privacy, and specifically the kind of reasoning
that I would go through to do so. And in response to that question,
yes, I would group myself in Justice Harlan's category.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, let me make it clear, I am not
asking you about how you would decide or what you even think
about Roe v. Wade.

  Judge SOUTER. I understand that.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, in the Griswold case, I am curious what
proposition you think it stands for. Do you believe it is a case in a
long line of cases, establishing an unenumerated right to privacy, a
right the Constitution protects, even though it is not specifically
mentioned in the document?
  Judge SOUTER. I think probably it would be fairest to say that it
is a case in a confused line of cases and it is a case which, again
referring to the approach that Justice Harlan took, it is a case
which to me represents at least the beginnings of the modern effort
to try to articulate an enforceable doctrine.
  My own personal approach to that derivation begins with, I sup-
pose, the most elementary propositions about constitutional govern-
ment, but I do not know of any other way to begin. I am mindful
not only of the national Constitution of 1787, but of the history of
State constitution-making in that same decade.
  If there is one generalization that we can clearly make, it is the
generalization about the intended limitation on the scope of gov-
ernmental power. When we think of the example of the national
Constitution, I think truly we are at the point in our history when
every schoolchild does know that the reason there was no Bill of
Rights attached to the draft submitted to the States in the first in-
stance after the convention recessed, was the view that the limita-
tions on the power to be given to the National Government was so
clearly circumscribed, that no one really needed to worry about the
possible power of the National Government to invade what we
                                      55
today group under the canon of civil liberties, and we know the his-
tory of that response.

  We know that there were States like my own which were willing
to ratify, but were willing to ratify only on the basis of requesting
that the first order of business of the new Congress would be to
propose a Bill of Rights in New Hampshire, like other States, who
was not bashful about saying would not be in it.

  The CHAIRMAN. Did you wish to continue?
  Judge SOUTER. If I may. This attitude did not sort of spring up
without some antecedent in 1787. I am not an expert on the consti-
tutions of all of the original States, but I do know something about
my own.
  One of the remarkable things about the New Hampshire Consti-
tution, which began its life at the beginning of that same decade, is
the fact that it began with an extraordinarily jealous regard for
civil rights, for human rights. The New Hampshire Constitution
did not simply jump in and establish a form of government. They
did not get to the form of government until they had gotten to the
Bill of Rights first.
  They couched that Bill of Rights with an extraordinary breadth
and a breadth which, for people concerned with principles of inter-
pretation, requires great care in the reading. But the New Hamp-
shire constitutionalists of 1780 and 1784 were equally concerned to
protect a concept of liberty, so-called, which they did not more pre-
cisely define.
  So, it seems to me that the starting point for anyone who reads
the Constitution seriously is that there is a concept of limited gov-
ernmental power which is not simply to be identified with the enu-
meration of those specific rights or specifically defined rights that
were later embodied in the bill.
  If there were any further evidence needed for this, of course, we
can start with the ninth amendment. I realize how the ninth
amendment has bedeviled scholars, and I wish I had something
novel to contribute to the jurisprudence on it this afternoon, which
I do not.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is novel that you acknowledge it, based on our
past hearings in this committee. [Laughter.]
  One of the last nominees said it was nothing but a waterblot on
the Constitution, which I found fascinating. At any rate, go ahead.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think it is two things--maybe it is more. I
have no reason to question the scholarship which has interpreted
one intent of the ninth amendment as simply being the protection
or the preservation of the State bills of rights which preceded it.
  Neither, quite frankly, do I find a basis for doubting that, with
respect to the national bill of rights, it was something other than
what it purported to be, and that was an acknowledgment that the
enumeration was not intended to be in some sense exhaustive and
in derogation of other rights retained.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that the school to which you would count
yourself a graduate?
  Judge SOUTER. I have to count myself a member of that school,
because, in any interpretive enterprise, I have to start with the
text and I do not have a basis for doubting that somewhat obvious
and straightforward meaning of the text.
                                                   56

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you another question here, and I re-
alize this is somewhat pedantic, but it is important for me to un-
derstand the foundation from which you build here.

  You have made several references appropriately to the Bill of
Rights and the Federal Government. Do you have any disagree-
ment with the incorporation doctrine that was adopted some 70
years ago applying the Bill of Rights to the States? Do you have
any argument with that proposition?

  Judge SOUTER. No; my argument with the incorporation doctrine
would be with the proposition that that was meant to exhaust the
meaning of enforceable liberty. That, in point of fact, as you know,
I mean that was Justice Harlan's concern.

  The next really--I mean that brings to the fore sort of the next
chapter in American constitutional history that bears on what we
are talking about, because one cannot talk about the privacy doc-
trine today, without talking about the 14th amendment.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I am truly interested in us going back
through in an orderly fashion the evolution of constitutional doc-
trine, but as my colleague sitting behind you will tell you, I only
have a half hour to talk to you and I want to ask you a few more
specific questions, if I may.

  The 14th amendment, as you know, was designed explicitly to
apply to the States. Speaking to the liberty clause of the 14th
amendment, Justice Harlan said:

  The full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be
found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provid-
ed in the Constitution,

Which is totally consistent with what you have been saying thus
far.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, do you agree with Justice Harlan that the
reference to liberty in the 5th and 14th amendments provide a
basis for certain--not all, but certain--unenumerated rights, rights
that the Constitution protects, even though they are not specifical-
ly enumerated within the Constitution?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the concept of liberty as enforceable under
the due process clause is, in fact, the means by which we enforce
those rights. It is sterile, I think, to go into this particular chapter
of constitutional history now, but you will recall that Justice Black
was a champion at one point of the view that the real point of the
fourth amendment, which was intended to apply unenumerated
substantive rights, was the privileges of immunities clause, and not
due process. Well, as a practical matter, that was read out of the
possibility of American constitutionalism, at least for its time, and
it has remained so by the slaughterhouse cases.
  What is left, for those who were concerned to enforce the unenu-
merated concepts of liberty was the liberty clause and due process,
and by a parity of reasoning by the search for coherence in consti-
tutional doctrine, we would look to the same place and the same
analysis in the fifth amendment when we are talking about the
National Government.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let us follow on. We recognize, you recog-
nize, you have stated that Griswold and the various means of rea-
                                       57

soning to arrive at the conclusion that there was a constitutionally
protected right of a married couple to determine whether or not to
procreate, to use birth control or not, is a constitutionally sound de-
cision.

  Now, shortly thereafter there was a similar case in Massachu-
setts, although in this case it did not apply to married couples,
there was a Massachusetts statute, in the Eisenstadt case, that said
unmarried couples, and the rationale was that there is reason to
not be out there allowing unmarried couples to buy birth control,
because it would encourage sexual promiscuity, and the Supreme
Court struck that down, as well, saying that it violated a right to
privacy, having found once again, most Justices ruled that way, in
the 14th amendment.

  Now, do you agree that that decision was rightly decided?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, my recollection--and I did not reread Eisen-
stadt before coming in here, so I hope my recollection is not faulty,
but my recollection is that Eisenstadt represented a different ap-
proach, because the reliance on the Court there was on equal pro-
tection. I know that my recollection is

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, the

  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry.
  The CHAIRMAN. GO ahead. I am sorry.
  Judge SOUTER. My recollection is that the criticism of Eisenstadt
at the time was whether the Supreme Court was, in fact, reaching
rather far to make the equal protection argument. But I think
there is one point that is undeniable, without specifically affirming
or denying the wisdom of Eisenstadt, and that is there is going to
be an equal protection implication from whatever bedrock start pri-
vacy is derived under the concept of due process, and I think that
then leads us back to the essentially difficult point of interpreta-
tion, and that is how do you go through the interpretive process to
find that content which is legitimate as a concept of due process.
  The CHAIRMAN. Also, to what extent you find it legitimate. Is it a
fundamental right, or is it an ordinary right? In the case of Gris-
wold, in the Griswold case, it was discerned and decided that there
was a fundamental right to privacy relating to the right of married
couples to use contraceptive devices. Do you believe they were cor-
rect in that judgment, that there is a fundamental right?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the way, again, I would express it without
getting myself into the position of endorsing the specifics of the
cases, is that I believe on reliable interpretive principles there is
certainly, to begin with, a core of privacy which is identified as
marital privacy, and I believe it can and should be regarded as fun-
damental.
  I think what we also have to recognize is that the notion of pro-
tected privacy, which may be enforceable under the 14th amend-
ment, has a great potential breadth and not every aspect of it may
rise to a fundamental level.
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree. That is why I am asking you the ques-
tion, because as you know as well as I do, if the Court concludes
that there is a fundamental right, then for a State to take action
that would extinguish that right, they must have, as we lawyers
call, it is required they look at it through the prism of strict scruti-
ny. Another way of saying it, for laymen, is that they must have a
                                                58

pretty darn good reason. If it is not a fundamental right and it is
an ordinary right, they can use a much lower standard to deter-
mine whether the State had a good enough reason to preempt that
right.

  So, as we talk about this line of cases, in Griswold and in Eisen-
stadt--let me skip, in Moore v. East Cleveland, where the Court
ruled, extending this principle of privacy from the question of pro-
creation, contraception and procreation, to the definition of a
family. As you know, East Cleveland had an ordinance defining a
family that did not include a grandmother and grandson, and so
East Cleveland, under that ordinance, said that a grandmother and
her two grandchildren could be evicted from a particular area in
which they lived, because they were not a family, as defined by the
local municipality in zoning ordinance.

  Now, the Court came along there and it made a very basic judg-
ment. It said--if I can find my note, which I cannot find right now,
and I think it is important to get the exact language, if I can find
it--I just found it. [Laughter.]

  Justice Powell said, "freedom of personal choice in matters of
marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the
Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment."

  Now, my question, Judge, is do you believe that that assertion by
Justice Powell is accurate?

  Judge SOUTER. I think that assertion by Justice Powell repre-
sents a legitimate judgment in these kinds of problems with respect
to Moore just as in the discussion with Griswold. I am going to ask
you to excuse me from specifically endorsing the particular result,
because I recognize the implications from any challenge that may
come from the other privacy case that is on everyone's mind.

  But the one thing that I want to make very clear is that my con-
cept of an enforceable marital right of privacy would give it funda-
mental importance. What the courts are doing in all of these cases
is saying--although we speak of tiers of scrutiny--what the courts
are saying, it seems to me in a basically straightforward way--is
that there is no way to escape a valuation of the significance of the
particular manifestation to privacy that we are concerned with,
and having given it a value we, indeed, have to hold the State to
an equally appropriate or commensurate reason before it interferes
with that value.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is exactly what I am trying to find out in
your answering. So the valuation applied to a definition of family,
is fundamental. The valuation applied to whether a married couple
can use contraception is fundamental. The valuation applied to
whether or not an unmarried couple can use contraception is fun-
damental.

  Now, I would like to ask you, as I move along here, as you look
at this line of cases we have mentioned--and I will not bother to go
through a couple of others that I have anticipated--is my time up?
I saw the light go off and I thought my time was about up and the
one thing these fellows are not likely to forgive me for--they will
forgive me for a lot of things but not for going over my time.

  That when it comes to personal freedom of choice, as Justice
Powell put it, in family and in marriage, one basic aspect of that
freedom is the right to procreate. Now, early in the 1940's, in the
                                       59

Skinner case, the Supreme Court said that criminals could not be
sterilized. The Court made it very clear and it said, "Marriage and
procreation are fundamental" and that sterilization affected "one
of the basic civil rights of man."

  I assume that some of the civil rights that you are referring to
that those who wrote the New Hampshire Constitution referred to.

  Do you agree that procreation is a fundamental right?
  Judge SOUTER. I would assume that if we are going to have any
core concept of marital privacy, that would certainly have to rank
at its fundamental heart.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, the reason I am pursuing this is not
merely for the reason you think, I suspect. It is because you have
been categorized as--I believe you have described yourself as an in-
terpretivist.
  Judge SOUTER. I did and I have, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have begun--and I thank you for it--you
have begun to flesh out for me on which part of the spectrum of
the interpretivists you find yourself.
  Let me, in the interest of time, move on here. I am trying to skip
by here.
  Let me ask you this, Judge. The value that the Court places on
certain alleged, by many, privacy rights will dictate, as we said ear-
lier, the burden placed upon a State in the circumstance when they
wish to extinguish that right, or impact on that right.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you have just told us that the right to use
birth control, to decide whether or not to become pregnant is one of
those fundamental rights--the value placed on it is fundamental.
  Now, let us say that a woman and/or her mate uses such a birth
control device and it fails. Does she still have a constitutional right
to choose not to become pregnant?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, that is the point at which I will have to
exercise the prerogative which you were good to speak of explicitly.
I think for me to start answering that question, in effect, is for me
to start discussing the concept of Roe v. Wade. I would be glad--I
do not think I have to do so for you--but I would be glad to explain
in some detail my reasons for believing that I cannot do so, but of
course, they focus on the fact that ultimately the question which
you are posing is a question which is implicated by any possibility
of the examination of Roe v. Wade. That, as we all know, is not
only a possibility, but a likelihood that the Court may be asked to
do it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, let me respectfully suggest the following
to you: That to ask you what principles you would employ does not,
in any way, tell me how you would rule on a specific fact situation.
  For example, all eight Justices, whom you will be joining, all
eight of them have found there to be a liberty interest that a
woman retains after being pregnant. That goes all the way from
Justice Brennan--who is no longer on the Court--who reached one
conclusion from having found that liberty interest, to Justice Scalia
who finds a liberty interest and yet, nonetheless says, explicitly he
would like to see Roe v. Wade, he thinks Roe v. Wade should be
overruled.
                                                60

  So the mere fact that you answer the question whether or not a
woman's liberty interest, a woman's right to terminate pregnancy
exists or does not exist, in no way tells me or anyone else within
our earshot how you would possibly rule on Roe v. Wade.

  Judge SOUTER. I think to explain my position, I think it is impor-
tant to bear in mind there are really two things that judges may or
may not be meaning when they say there is a liberty interest to do
thus and so, whatever it may be. They may mean simply that in
the whole range of human interests and activities the particular
action that you are referring to is one which falls within a broad
concept of liberty. If liberty means what it is, we can do if we want
to do it. Then obviously in that sense of your question, the answer
is, yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. It is more precise, Judge, than that. I mean liber-
ty interest has a constitutional connotation that most lawyers and
all justices have ascribed to it in varying degrees. For example,
Justices Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, they have
said a woman has a strong liberty interest, although Justice Ste-
vens has phrased it slightly differently. Justice O'Connor has made
it clear that she believes a woman has some liberty interest. Even
Justices Rehnquist, White, Kennedy, and Scalia, all of whom criti-
cized the Court's rulings in this area have said that a woman has
at least some liberty interest in choosing not to remain pregnant.

  Now, each of these Court members has acknowledged what we
lawyers call a liberty interest after conception. So my question to
you is, is there a liberty interest retained by a woman after concep-
tion?

  Judge SOUTER. I think, Senator, again, we have got to be careful
about the sense of the liberty interest. There is the very broad
sense of the term which I referred to before and then there is the
sense of an enforceable liberty interest. That is to say, one which is
enforceable against the State, based upon a valuation that it is fun-
damental. It seems to me that that is the question which is part of
the analysis, of course, upon which Roe v. Wade rests.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, all liberty interests have following all lib-
erty interest is a right. The question is, how deeply held and rooted
that right is; and what action the State must take and how serious
that action must be--the rationale for that action--to overcome
that interest?

  But once we acknowledge there is a liberty interest, there is a
right.

  Judge SOUTER. But what--I am sorry.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO I am not asking you to tell me--I am just told
my time is up--I am not asking you to tell me what burden of
proof the State must show in order to overcome that. I am asking
you is there a liberty interest and your answer is what, yes, or no?
  Judge SOUTER. My answer is that the most that I can legitimate-
ly say is that in the spectrum of possible protection that would
rank as an interest to be asserted under liberty, but how that inter-
est should be evaluated, and the weight that should be given to it
in determining whether there is in any or all circumstances a suffi-
ciently countervailing governmental interest is a question with re-
spect, I cannot answer.
  The CHAIRMAN. With all due respect, I have not asked it.
                                      61
  But I will come back to that. My time is up. I yield to my col-
league from South Carolina.
  I thank you, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, the Constitution of the United States is now over
200 years old. Many Americans have expressed their views about
the amazing endurance of this great document. Would you please
share with the committee your opinion as to the success of our
Constitution and its distinction as the oldest existing constitution
in the world today.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, it is difficult to make a pronounce-
ment which is commensurate with the magnificence of the docu-
ment. If I have to explain it in a few words I would do it by refer-
ence to a very limited number of concepts.
  The first reason for the Constitution's success is its insistence
and its recognition on the source of power. The source of govern-
mental power is the people.
  The second concept which has guaranteed its endurance is that
that power is no more granted to government than the people
grant to government. The very concept of the National Govern-
ment is one of limited power, was one of its motivating, one of its
very forces of life from the moment that it was presented to the
people.
  Third, I would look to the concept implicit in that document and
as a basis of the bedrock of the structural sense of American consti-
tutionalism that power is divided and that that division of power
even granted, is a division of power which must be protected if the
entire Government is to remain in the place that it was intended to
have.
  That structural sense of the division of power encompasses not
only what we speak of as the separation of powers doctrine within
the National Government, itself, but the concept of the distribution
of power in a federal system.
  I think the reasons then for the remarkable and blessed endur-
ance of the American Constitution are extraordinarily pragmatic
reasons. It rests upon a recognition of where its power comes from
and it is structured with a recognition that power will be abused
unless it is limited and divided and restrained.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the 10th amendment to the
Constitution provides that powers not delegated to the Federal
Government are reserved to the States or the people.
  Would you describe your general view about the proper relation-
ship between Federal and State Governments, as well as how
would you characterize the States' power to legislate in areas not
specifically enumerated to the Congress.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, as we know--certainly you know
better than I, having sat in this Congress as you have--there is a
great overlap of subject matter in which we know the Congress
under article I has authority, and which is equally covered by the
States. We are familiar with the doctrines of preemption which
have developed over the years and we are familiar, of course, with
the provision of the Constitution that in cases of conflict in legisla-
tion within both the constitutional competence of the States and
                                               62

the National Government, the National Government is, of course,
going to prevail.

  One of the things that I think we have to recognize in dealing
with problems of federalism today is a basic political problem
which in those areas of overlap the Constitution, itself, cannot
solve for us. That is a political problem that arises from the will-
ingness or the unwillingness of the States to exercise the constitu-
tional powers that they have to address the problems that are
really before them.

  One of the things that I was reminded of in my preparation, my
sort of autobiographical inquiry--which has preceded my coming
here today and has been going on for the last 7 or 8 weeks--is a
speech which I gave years ago in Newport, NH, in which I was
talking about--which to most people and to me seemed--an erosion
of power all in the direction of the National Government from the
States.

  But the explanation for that erosion began with the fact that
there were problems to be solved which the States simply would
not address and the people wanted them addressed and therefore,
the people looked to Washington. They looked to Washington, of
course, because Washington had the means or exerted the means of
raising the money to solve them.

  So one of the problems that has to be recognized, as underlying
so much of the tension which sometimes gets expressed by focus on
the 10th amendment, is, in fact, a political problem and ultimately
a fiscal problem.

  We know that the concept of the 10th amendment today is some-
thing that we cannot look at with the eyes of the people who wrote
it. At the very least, two developments in our constitutional history
have necessarily changed the significance of the 10th amendment
for us.

  The first, of course, is the concept of the commerce power which
I think--whatever everyone's predilections may be--has grown to
a, and has been recognized as having a plenary degree which would
probably have astonished the Founders.

  The second development which has got to be borne in mind in
coming to any approach to the 10th amendment is simply, the
14th. There was, very expressly, authority given to the National
Government through the 14th amendment, which again, was incon-
ceivable to the Framers of the 10th.

  It is those two developments that have led to the difficulty re-
flected in a number of cases in recent years, in trying to determine,
whether in fact, there is a substantive basis, an objective basis, per-
haps I should say, for identifying and protecting State power under
the 10th amendment; or whether conversely, the 10th amendment,
in effect, has been relegated to the expression of kind of a political
truism.

  When I was in public practice, the case known as National
League of Cities v. Usury was the law, which recognized a basis for
enforcing limitation on national power in name of the 10th amend-
ment under the wage and hour law. Subsequently National League
was overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio, which has left the law, at
the present time far closer to, in effect, a reflection of the politics
of the Congress of the United States.
                                                63

  I do not know what the next step in that chapter may be, but I
do know that any approach to the 10th amendment today is an ap-
proach which has got to take into consideration constitutional de-
velopments outside of the 10th amendment which we cannot
ignore, and, as I have said, would have astonished the Framers.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the famous decision of Mar-
bury v. Madison is viewed as a basis of the Supreme Court's au-
thority to interpret the Constitution and issue decisions which are
binding on both the executive and legislative branches. Would you
give the committee your views on this authority?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I suppose for anyone in the year 1990 to
speak admiringly of Marbury v. Madison is a fairly conservative
act, so I don't have any trouble in sort of going out on the limb in
support of Marbury v. Madison.

  I recognize that the difficulty which may be facing us in assess-
ing the significance of Marbury v. Madison today is a difficulty in
defining the appropriate role of Congress with respect to the appel-
late jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. We
might all hope that that kind of a contest would not come before
us, but we cannot rule it out.

  The question, of course, is not whether Marbury can be overruled
as such, but whether the force of Marbury can, in fact, be eroded
by limitations upon the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the United States. As I am sure you know as well as I, the exist-
ing precedent on that is not of very great help to us.

  We know that in the one case expressly addressing the Supreme
Court's appellate jurisdiction, a post-Civil War case, McCardle, the
Court seemed to say that there could be such an erosion through
the exercise of congressional power, although there are times when
I find McCardle a somewhat more ambiguous case than some have
found it.

  On the other hand, we know in the Klein case that followed not
long after that, which dealt with the jurisdiction of the lower Fed-
eral courts not the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,
that the Supreme Court clearly put limits upon what the Congress
could do in trying, in effect, to limit jurisdiction for the sake of
bringing about particular results or avoiding particular results
which were thought to be undesirable.

  But those are all post-Civil War cases. They seem to speak with
conflicting and certainly not with consistent voices. And they are
going to be the preface to any question about the ultimate vitality
of Marbury in our time. But it is at least comforting to be able to
end my response to you as I began it; that subject to that issue
which has yet definitively to come before the courts, I trust every-
one like me will accept Marbury as constitutionally essential to
government as we know it.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the opinion of Miranda v. Ari-
zona defined the parameters of police conduct for interrogating sus-
pects in custody. Since th[e decision, the Supreme Court has limited
the scope of Miranda in certain cases. Do you feel that the efforts
and comments of top law enforcement officers throughout the
country have had any effect on the Court's views?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, of, course, Senator, I cannot speak expressly
for the Court, but I thi^ik those comments must have had some
                                       64

kind of effect. The legitimacy of that effect, the appropriateness of
the Court's listening, I think has got to be assessed from two differ-
ent standpoints. It is very important that courts not be swayed in
any case merely by the politics of the moment. And there is, I
think, a laudable tendency--I hope it will always be regarded as
laudable--for the Court to keep itself above the momentary furor.

  It would be a mistake, however, from that, for a court to be un-
willing ever to reexamine the wisdom of something that it had
done. This is certainly true when we are dealing with decisions like
Miranda, which are very pragmatic decisions. Whether one initial-
ly agreed or did not agree with Miranda, the point of Miranda was
to produce a practical means to avoid what seemed to be unduly
time consuming and sometimes intractable problems encountered
in the Federal courts in dealing with claims that confessions were
inadmissible on grounds of their involuntariness.

  But Miranda was a practical case on how to deal with it. The as-
sumption of the Court was that if Miranda, in fact, was complied
with, a lot of the very difficult voluntariness problems were just
going to take care of themselves. When we are dealing with a rule
like Miranda, which had a very practical objective which, as was
said at the time, extended the fifth amendment to the police sta-
tion for the sake of trying to avoid other more serious problems, of
course it is appropriate to consider the practical effect that those
decisions have. And I have no doubt that both in the briefs that
have been filed before the courts and in the arguments of the spe-
cific parties, the satisfaction or the dissatisfaction of law enforce-
ment with the practical effects of that decision have had an influ-
ence, and rightly so, on the courts.

  By the same token, I think it is important to note that when we
look back on a decision which has been on the books as long as Mi-
randa has now, we are faced with a similarly, I think, practical ob-
ligation, if one wants it modified or expanded or contracted, to ask
very practical questions about how it actually works. That is a judi-
cial obligation. If the judiciary is going to be imposing pragmatic
rules.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, there are hundreds of inmates
under death sentence across the country. Many have been on death
row for several years as a result of the endless appeals process. Re-
cently, the Senate passed legislation which would reduce the
number of unnecessary appeals. Generally, would you give the
committee your views on the validity of placing some reasonable
limitations on the number of posttrial appeals that allow inmates
under death sentences to avoid execution for years after the com-
mission of their crimes?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator Thurmond, I am not familiar with
the bill which the Senate has passed, but I am assuming that it
was probably in response to the report of the committee headed by
Justice Powell a couple of years ago, retired Justice Powell, who
was--the committee, rather, was addressing the problem of what
you describe rightly as the seemingly endless appellate process and
frequently of the confusion in haste which tended to characterize it
at the Federal level.

  I think there was great wisdom in the recommendation of the
Powell committee, because what the Powell committee centered on
                                       65

was not in the first instance a strict rule of limitation, but on the
problem which, in fact, was leading to the resort, frequently at the
last moment, to the Federal courts in death penalty cases.

  What the Powell committee identified as one of those reasons
was the fact that, although counsel is guaranteed to a criminal de-
fendant through the direct appellate process, in most States coun-
sel was, in any event, in the process of collateral review by habeas
corpus after the direct appeal process had been exhausted, there
was not a mandate under the national Constitution to the States to
provide counsel at that level, and most States were not doing so.

  The practical result was that in the attempt at collateral review
at the State level, death row inmates were, in fact, trying to raise
constitutional issues without counsel competent to do so--they
were issues of sufficient subtlety that a pro se litigant simply could
not handle them--and that time was being consumed in what was
really unproductive, almost helpless, litigation in State court collat-
eral review. And it was only when that was exhausted and only
when, in fact, an execution date was set that the prisoners would
then find it appropriate to try to go into the Federal courts for col-
lateral review.

  What the Powell Commission recommended was that if we are
going to place reasonable limits on Federal collateral review, we
have got to accept the reality that there has got to be some kind of
genuinely significant representation by counsel at the very point
collateral review can begin, so that it can be worth something both
at the State level and at the moment the petitioners enter the Fed-
eral scheme. And if that can be provided, if counsel can properly be
provided at the initial stages, then it is fair and appropriate to
place limitations upon the time in which collateral review can be
sought.

  I can only say that I think that is an eminently fair approach to
the problem.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, you are currently serving as a
member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Judicial Circuit.
Previously, you served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court for 7
years and the New Hampshire Superior Court for 5 years. How
beneficial, in your opinion, will this prior judicial experience be to
you if confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator Thurmond, for someone who has
never sat on the Supreme Court, there is great difficulty in answer-
ing that question, because the one thing that I think we all hear
about the Supreme Court and its workload is that the combination
of the task, the volume of the task, and the responsibility of the
task is something for which no one really feels prepared at the be-
ginning of service on that Court. And probably it would be impossi-
ble that anyone could be.

  There are at least some bits of background which I hope would
fit me to work into the responsibilities of the Court as fast as possi-
ble if I am confirmed. Although the supreme court on which I sat,
without question, did not have the demands on me that the Su-
preme Court of the United States would have, it shares the prob-
lem of all appellate courts in the United States today of having a
series of requests for review which, as a practical matter, tend to
                                       66

exceed the capacity of the court to deal with the depth that the
court would like.

  In New Hampshire, before I ever went on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court, we had gone necessarily to a system of discretion-
ary review because it was impossible to review every request for an
appeal on the merits. So I am familiar, in fact, with the business of
the Court and the need to set some kind of limits to make any
worthwhile adjudication possible.

  More than that, though, I think the important thing is what I
alluded to in the remarks that I made before the questioning began
today. There is one overriding responsibility that any judge on an
appellate court has. It will not guarantee that he will get the right
result, but it will guarantee that he will try as best he can to get
the right results. And that is a recognition that however far re-
moved from the bench of that court, the decision that the court
renders, the ruling that the court makes is going to affect a life.

  I have learned that lesson, and it is a lesson which, if I am con-
firmed, I hope will stand me in good stead.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, I believe that judges should
impose tough sentences in criminal cases, especially when the
crime committed is one of violence. Society demands tough punish-
ment for violent offenders. In the past, victims of those who com-
mitted violent crimes have often played a diminished role in the
criminal justice system. However, recently, the number of victims
who participate in the prosecution of criminal cases has increased.

  In your opinion, should victims play a major role in the criminal
justice system? If so, to what extent should a victim participate?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, there are certainly two respects in
which victims should be recognized in the system, and there is a
further interest of victims which the government as a whole should
recognize. The most obvious role of the victim, of course, is the role
which any victim must play in establishing the fact of the crime.
Your central witness, theoretically, in a criminal case is the victim.
The victim also, it seems to me, has a claim to the attention of the
court in a criminal case if there is, in fact, a conviction.

  We try to avoid disparity in sentencing, hue one of the subjects
which is appropriate to bear in mind is exactly the one that you
raised a moment ago, and that was: What was, in fact, the conduct
of the defendant? What degree of either mild or outrageous behav-
ior can we assign to the conduct of the defendant in relation to the
victim in causing harm? The heinousness of a crime is an appropri-
ate subject in any sentencing decision.

  I think going beyond that, one of the happy developments of the
law in the last few years is the recognition by the government that
after the criminal case is tried, whatever may be the result, the
victim is still left, in many cases, in a mess not of the victim's own
choosing; and that, in fact, there is a need to provide some help.
The victim assistance acts which the States have been passing, it
seems to me, is a step in the right direction.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the doctrine of stare decisis is
a concept well entrenched in our legal system and the concept that
virtually all judges have in mind when making decisions, especially
in difficult cases. I am sure that the issue of prior authority has
                                                67

been a factor which you have considered many times in your years
on the bench.

  Could you please briefly state your general view of stare decisis
and under what circumstances you would consider it appropriate to
overrule prior precedent?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, as you know, the doctrine of stare
decisis which we speak of in that shorthanded kind of way is a
series of considerations which courts bear in mind in deciding
whether a prior precedent should be followed or should not be.
Some such doctrine or some such rule is a bedrock necessity if we
are going to have in our judicial systems anything that can be
called the rule of law as opposed simply to random decisions on a
case-to-case basis.

  The problem that the doctrine of stare decisis addresses is the
problem of trying to give a proper value to a given precedent when
someone asks a court to overrule it and to go another way. And I
suppose the complexity of the doctrine is such that, contrary to the
terms of your question, I suppose I could talk about it for a very
long time. And there may be other members of the committee

  Senator THURMOND. YOU need not do that.
  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say, I think you have made it very
clear that that is not what you had in mind, and I don't know
whether any other members of the committee may be greater bears
for punishment to go into it further than you have or not. Let me,
though, in compliance with your terms, just state in a very kind of
outline way what I think we should look to, without meaning to be
exhaustive.
  The first thing, kind of the threshold question that, of course,
you start with on any issue or precedent, is the question of whether
the prior case was wrong. We don't raise precedential issues unless
we are starting with the assumption that there is something inap-
propriate about the prior decision. Now, that decision may have
been right at the time and there now be a claim that, in fact, it is
wrong to be applied now. But the first question that we have to ask
is: If we were deciding the case today, if we were living in a kind of
Garden of Eden and we didn't have the precedent and this was the
first case, would we decide it the same way?
  If the answer is no, we would not do so, then we look to a series
of factors to try to decide how much value we ought to put on that
precedent even though it is not one that we particularly like or
would think appropriate in the first instance.
  One of the factors which is very important I will throw together
under the term of reliance. Who has relied upon that precedent,
and what does that reliance count for today? Have people
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Judge. Did you say if the answer is
no or if the answer is yes? You said when we look back
  Judge SOUTER. My problem, Mr. Chairman, is I forget what the
question was.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry. You indicated that one of the things
you looked at is whether the prior case was wrongly decided, isn't
that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Then the answer should have been yes. I said no?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes. OK. I got it.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you for amending that.
                                                   68

  The CHAIRMAN. I was getting confused.
  Judge SOUTER. If you are going to ask me for a statutory inter-
pretation, I would be as liberal as that, then you may have me in a
corner. But assuming we start with a precedent which is wrong for
this time, considered by itself, one of the things we are going to
start by looking at is the degree and the kind of reliance that has
been placed upon it.
  We ask in some context whether private citizens in their lives
have relied upon it in their own planning to such a degree that, in
fact, it would be a great hardship in overruling it now.
  We look to whether legislatures have relied upon it, in legisla-
tion which assumes the correctness of that precedent. We look to
whether the court in question or other courts have relied upon it,
in developing a body of doctrine. If a precedent, in fact, is consist-
ent with a line of development which extends from its date to the
present time, then the cost of overruling that precedent is, of
course, going to be enormously greater and enormously different
from what will be the case in instances in which the prior case
either has not been followed or the prior case has simply been
eroded, chipped away at, as we say, by later determinations.
  Beyond that, we look to such factors as the possibility of other
means of overruling the precedent. There is some difference, al-
though we may have trouble in weighting it, there is some differ-
ence between constitutional and statutory interpretation precedent,
which Congress or a legislature can overrule, so we look to other
possibilities.
  In all of these instances, we are trying to give a fair weight to
the claim of that precedent to be followed today, even though in
some respect we find it deficient on the merits.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, former Associate Justice
Lewis F. Powell once stated:

  Those of us who work quietly in our marble palace find it difficult to understand
the apparent fascination with how we go about our business. However, as our deci-
sions concern the liberty, property and even the lives of litigants, there can be no
thought of tomorrow's headlines.

  Judge Souter, would you share with the committee your thoughts
regarding Justice Powell's statement, especially his comment that
"there can be no thought of tomorrow's headlines"?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I hope there is no judge in the Republic
who would not agree with that statement of Justice Powell. If
there is one thing that

  Senator THURMOND. That is sufficient. [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. YOU are going to turn me into a laconic Yankee,
if you keep doing that, Senator. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. I have just been told that my time is up,
Judge Souter. Thank you. I was trying to get in another question,
but it is too late.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to direct the judge's attention to the issue of civil
rights. I am sure you understand, as all Americans understand,
that the issue of slavery, when it was discussed at the Constitution-
                                          69

al Convention almost ruptured that whole process and compro-
mises were made during the consideration of the Constitutional
Convention.

  As a consequence of accepting slavery, we saw a vicious Civil
War that took place in the 1860's on that issue. We saw this coun-
try go through enormous convulsion in the late 1950's and early
1960's, with loss of life, as we were trying to move toward a fairer,
more equitable society, to breath real life into the Constitution
when it talks about equal protection of the laws.

  I am interested in your own views about the majesty of the Con-
stitution and about providing guarantees for the citizens of this
Nation, whether black or white, man or woman, of whatever reli-
gious, in assuring that the words "equal protection of the laws"
really mean equal protection of the laws. I am most interested at
this point in having your view about the authority and the legiti-
macy of the Congress in implementing the 14th amendment,
through the 5th section.

  So, I would like to direct your attention to a couple of these
areas, firstly that you took positions on as attorney general and as-
sistant attorney general of New Hampshire. Both of these areas
relate to the questions of pursuing equal rights and liberties. First
of all, I want to talk about eliminating discrimination in the work-
place and guaranteeing equal opportunity in employment.

  I am sure you are aware of the case which I am directing your
attention to, decided in 1973, when the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission regulations required State and local communi-
ties and private firms with over 100 employees to file annual re-
ports, listing racial composition of the employers' work force, to
assist the Commission in its mission.

   In many circumstances, we see Evan Kemp, President Bush's
head of EEOC, talking about how necessary such statistics are
today and recognize the importance of the accumulation of that
type of material.

   Now, unlike every other State, New Hampshire rejected the reg-
ulation and it refused to supply the data for 1973, 1974, and 1975.
When the U.S. Government sued to enforce the requirement, you
defended the refusal, as New Hampshire Attorney General, and
when New Hampshire lost in the Federal district court, you ap-
pealed to the circuit court of appeals, which unanimously rejected
your position, and then you tried to take the issue to the Supreme
Court, which refused even to hear your case, let alone accept your
argument.

   Your office took the position in all three courts that it was un-
constitutional to require employers to compile reports of those sta-
tistics. A reading of the brief would indicate that you did not be-
lieve that Congress had the power to implement and develop that
legislation of their work force.

   As far as I can determine, no other employer, public or private,
pressed such an excessive claim, so hostile to civil rights. Your
brief even went so far as to make the extraordinary argument that
it violated a worker's constitutional right to privacy, for employers
to report the overall racial composition of their work force.

   My question is this: Did you agree with the position of the State
of New Hampshire that it is unconstitutional for Congress to re-
                                                70

quire employers to provide statistics about racial composition of
the work force?

  Judge SOUTER. At the time that case was litigated, Senator, I did
not know whether it was consitutional or not. That case, as I think
you realize, was

  Senator KENNEDY. What I am directing your attention to is your
view about the power of the Congress, under section 5 of the 14th
amendment, that when it finds that there is discrimination, that
we have the power to try and take steps to eliminate the discrimi-
nation as best we can. We are not going to argue that laws are
going to resolve all of these problems. Clearly, they are not. But
the issue and the question, the basic issue and question is whether
you recognize the authority and the power of the Congress to devel-
op legislation, in this case the EEO Act, which required the kind of
information that I have mentioned, in order for the American
people to be able to gain these rights.

  Judge SOUTER. There is no question that, under the law as it is
understood today and under the law as I understand it, that Con-
gress has a preferred and unique role of power in enforcing the
14th amendment under section 5.

  There is probably no question that there will be further years of
litigation before the exact limits of that power are defined, but
there are some things that are clear now. It is clear now under the
law that the Congress certainly does not stand on the same footing
as the State and county and local governments may do in devising
remedies for a broader societal discrimination than may come to
light in specific cases. We know that the Congress has a preferred
position in that respect.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you certainly had the opportunity to de-
velop your own personal view at the time that you were developing
the position, as the Governor's lawyer. Did you form any position
on your own, as to whether that was the correct position? Did you
do it reluctantly? What can you tell us? We know that the lawyer
who assisted you in the case, Mr. Edward Haffer, was quoted in the
press as saying that you were supportive of and involved in the
effort to challenge the regulation. Governor Thompson has said
that you did not discourage him from pursuing the case to the Su-
preme Court.

  So, did you at the time formulate any personal view about the
legitimacy of the Congress in attempting to root out discrimination
in the workplace?

  Judge SOUTER. I came to no comprehensive personal view of sec-
tion 5 at that time. The views that I came to grips with at that
time were these: The first, of course, is that I was representing a
client. The issue before me, as a lawyer in that case, was whether
the client, whose policy was being set by the executive branch,
speaking through the Governor, had a legitimate position which
could in good faith be pressed before the courts. It was my judg-
ment at that time that the State did, in fact, have a case which
could be pressed in defense of the Governor's position.

  The most remarkable thing about it and the reason for coming to
this conclusion which I drew as a lawyer, is indicated in an unusu-
al way in our constitutional history. In a footnote in a later opinion
by Justice Powell that came about years later--and I cannot cite it
                                          71

from memory, but I can produce it, if you would like--Justice
Powell referred to a survey of discrimination by State and local
governments on racial grounds, and I do not recall now whether it
was strictly State employment discrimination or discrimination in
voting, but it illustrated the truth that lay behind the decision that
New Hampshire could take that position and press it before the
courts, for whatever disposition, and that determination was that
there was no indication that there had ever been racial discrimina-
tion, what we would today broadly call title VII discrimination, by
the State or local governments.

  The issue that the Governor wished and the State wished to
press forward was whether the power of section 5 of the 14th
amendment, whether the congressional power could in fact be used
to require the assembly of racial data by a governmental entity
with respect to whom there was absolutely no historical indication
of any discrimination.

  As I think you know from the briefs which I know have been
brought to your attention, one of the concerns raised is that if you
have not been thinking in racial terms and you are suddenly forced
to start classifying nor at least to classify statistically in racial
terms, you are running the risk that race is, in fact, going to play a
role and a wrong role, which it has never done.

  The issue before me, as attorney general of New Hampshire, in
carrying on with that litigation which had in fact begun before I
became attorney general, was whether in fact there was an argu-
ment that could be made to that effect. I believed that there was
an argument that could be made to that effect. The courts rejected
it and it is, of course, not an argument that would be made today.

  Senator KENNEDY. Of course, first of all, as attorney general, you
take the oath of office in upholding the Constitution. Second, the
New Hampshire statute says the attorney general will represent
the public interest in the administration of the department of jus-
tice, be responsible to the Governor, the general court, and the
public for such administration.

  So, what we have to gather here, and when you give a response
that you are just acting as the lawyer for the Governor, we have to
give some weight to the fact that you are sworn to an oath of
office, both in terms of the Constitution and the New Hampshire
statute. Very clearly you are not only the lawyer for the Governor,
but you also represent the public interest.

  You have stated that you support that concept as a matter of
personal belief now and, as I gather, you were uncertain at the
time when you filed the brief, is that correct?

  Judge SOUTER. The question that I thought could be legitimately
raised at the time was whether, in fact, as against a governmental
entity which had not practiced any discrimination, either specific
or reflective of societal discrimination, that was an appropriate ex-
ercise of section 5 power. I think we now know very clearly that it
is.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the point that we are talking about is a
national determination by the Congress that this kind of informa-
tion is necessary in order to try to gather discrimination informa-
tion that is necessary before any action can be taken, and also to
try to measure some progress in this area.
                                                 72

   Tell me, why did you file information with regard to gender in
employment, and not with regard to race? I found that somewhat
puzzling. You submitted the information to EEOC with regard to
gender, but not with regard to race, and the 14th amendment
clearly is about race and about gender--in terms of that--why did
you file that?

  Judge SOUTER. As you indicate, I think the 14th amendment is
about both.

  Senator KENNEDY. Right.
  Judge SOUTER. I think, in fact, the answer to that is one which,
with respect, I would almost have to direct to my client. If you
were to ask me cold whether the State was filing gender informa-
tion at that time, I could not have told you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me go to a second area of civil rights, and
this is with regard to the literacy tests. You are familiar that in
1965 the Congress took action to abolish literacy tests in the limit-
ed number of States that were included in the 1965 act, and then
in the 1970 act we abolished literacy tests generally across the
country?
  Judge SOUTER. I think they were suspended, were they not, for 5
years by the 1970 amendments?
  Senator KENNEDY. Exactly. The State of New Hampshire vigor-
ously defended the State law, arguing that Congress did not have,
again, the constitutional authority to ban literacy tests. Your name
appears on the brief. Do you remember whether you drafted it or
not?
  Judge SOUTER. I was assistant attorney general at that time, and
my recollection is that I filed aposttrial memorandum with the
U.S. district court after that case was argued. I remember I was
the assistant attorney general assigned to argue
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, your name is on the brief, the third one
down.
  Judge SOUTER. Pardon me?
  Senator KENNEDY. Your name is on the brief.
  Judge SOUTER. I was not trying to get you to read the names off,
Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. We have got two of them.
  Now, when this was brought up in the district court, the position
was rejected 3 to 0, and then when it was brought up eventually in
the Supreme Court, the position was rejected 9 to 0. Again, the
question I think is how you view the Congress' power to try and
provide remedies against discrimination against minorities and
women.
  Very little was given me when I heard you talk about the ques-
tions of limited power. You talk about the overlap of power that
exists and the power of preemption by the National Government.
You say that the National Government will prevail when there is
conflict, and speak of the movement toward greater power to the
National Government, primarily political and fiscal in recent
times, but did not mention what has been the most, I consider the
most important reason in the past several years, and that is to try
and guarantee civil rights and liberties to minorities. This is some-
thing that we have to make a judgment on.
                        73

  Another part of that brief that concerned me that I want you to
speak to, is in the brief you said that if people who could not read
were permitted to cast ballots, it would dilute the votes of literate
citizens. You went on to say:

  To this harm, must be added the impossibility of providing any means whereby
illiterate voters could intelligently vote upon the constitutional proposals which are
presented on the ballot in narrative form. The result of allowing illiterates to make
a choice in such matters is tantamount to authorizing them to vote at random, ut-
terly without comprehension.

  Yet, in a letter to the President on the issue, when Congress was
considering the Voting Rights Act of 1970, Father Hesburgh, who
was Chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, said this:

  The lives and fortunes of illiterates are no less affected by the actions of local,
State and Federal governments than those of their more fortunate brethren. Today,
with television so widely available, it is possible for one with little formal education
to be well-informed, an intelligent member of the electorate.

What troubles me is that you said that the Congress did not have
the power to collect data on race discrimination. Now, you say that
Congress does not have the power to ban literacy tests for voting.
Congress is attempting to deal with the profound historical, nation-
al problem that this country has ached at over its history and con-
tinues to do so today.
Yet, we have seen these fundamental areas--you seem to inter-
pret the powers of Congress so narrowly that we cannot achieve
our purpose--even fundamental areas such as race discrimination
and the right to vote.  *
Judge SOUTER. Well, with respect, Senator, let me address a
couple of points that you raise. Maybe the best place to start is
with the fundamental one. That is about me today, as opposed to
me as an advocate in a voting rights case 20 years ago.
I hope one thing will be clear and this is maybe the time to make
it clear, and that is that with respect to the societal problems of
the United States today there is none which, in my judgment, is
more tragic or more demanding of the efforts of every American in
the Congress and out of the Congress than the removal of societal
discrimination in matters of race and in the matters of invidious
discrimination which we are unfortunately too familiar with.
That, I hope, when these hearings are over, will be taken as a
given with respect to my set of values.
The second thing that I think must be said, with respect to that
case of 20 years ago, is that I was not giving an interpretation 20
years ago. I was acting as an advocate, as a lawyer, in asserting a
position on behalf of a client. Maybe it is unnecessary to add, but I
know that you recognize that the identity of the Governor has
nothing to do with the responsibility of the attorney general to
bring a case.
This voting rights case, by the way, did not arise during the ad-
ministration of the Governor that you have just been referring to.
It arose during the Peterson administration which preceded his.
The issue that was presented to the State was, in one respect, simi-
lar to one we have already discussed.
New Hampshire had a literacy test. The literacy test had never
been used or, indeed, ever have been claimed to have been used for
any discriminatory purposes whatsoever. There is some question as
                                                 74

to what its practical effect was in those days. But it had never been
used for discrimination.

  There was one thing that we did know very clearly about the law
in those days, and that was that the use of a literacy test for a non-
discriminatory purpose was constitutional under the 14th amend-
ment. That had been litigated.

  So that New Hampshire's practice was, in fact, a wholly constitu-
tional practice. The issue which the Governor requested the attor-
ney general to raise was: Is it within the power of Congress, under
section 5, to suspend a literacy test in a State in which there is ab-
solutely no history or evidence of any sort, at any time, of its dis-
criminatory use, in such a way as to be unconstitutional under the
14th amendment?

  That issue was not ultimately decided until about 4 or 5 months
after our case began. That issue was decided in Oregon v. Mitchell,
and as you indicated a moment ago, the Court under varying ra-
tionales--some under 14th and some under 15th amendment analy-
ses--decided that it was, in fact, within the power of the Congress
to deal with literacy and the discrimination frequently associated
with it, as a national problem, and to suspend the test without
regard to any particular history of discrimination in the States.

  But that case had not been decided at the time that ours was
brought. Therefore, the attorney general at the time was in the po-
sition, No. 1, of being requested by the Governor to defend a consti-
tutional action under existing State law. I think that was within
the appropriate role of an advocate, and it did not represent a per-
sonal opinion, either by the attorney general or anyone else in-
volved in the litigation about the ultimate scope of Congress' power
under section 5.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, Judge, I must say that you keep coming
back to the role of the Governor's lawyer. It is very clear to me
that the oath of office that you take, as attorney general in the
statute requires, and a part of your responsibility as attorney gen-
eral is, your responsibility to the public trust and to the people.

  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator KENNEDY. SO now we know where you are today. I think
the question is, where were you then?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I think you have answered that
question. Where we were then, where the attorney general was and
where I was as an assistant attorney general in that case was in
defending a State practice which the Supreme Court of the United
States had ruled to be constitutional under the 14th amendment.
  I think that cannot be reasonably regarded as a derogation of the
duty of the State to its people. It may have turned out to be a legal
position which the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately
rejected, but I think it is a defensible one.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you can see what the impact would have
been if they had not rejected it, because then we would have had
50 different types of solutions which the Federal Government
would have been attempting to deal with in a problem of major na-
tional concern.
  Let me go to the issue of the equal protection clause of the 14th
amendment. The Supreme Court struck down virtually all laws
that discriminate on the basis of race. On the other hand, they
                                      75
used a weak standard, on other classifications, and upheld many
laws under the rational justification test.

  Obviously they have drawn a distinction between trucks and
automobiles and different laws for businesses of different sizes.
Before the 1970's, the Supreme Court applied the weakest test to
cases involving claims of sex discrimination. The Court accepted
any rational basis for laws that discriminated against women.
Under this approach women were routinely excluded from many
occupations, including being lawyers, and many areas even serving
as jurors.

  Beginning in the 1970's, the Court began to apply a higher stand-
ard of review to laws that discriminated against women. But evi-
dently you did not agree with that standard. In 1978, you urged the
Court to reexamine and perhaps eliminate the new standard.

  The issue here does not turn on the facts of the case. It involved
the New Hampshire statutory rape law, and a man convicted
under the statute claimed the law was unconstitutional because it
did not apply to women, too. The Supreme Court refused to hear
the New Hampshire case, but a few years later the Court, in an-
other case, made clear that under even the higher standard of
review, statutory rape laws were valid, even though they do not
apply to women.

  What I find very disturbing is that in your brief you urged the
Supreme Court to eliminate the higher standard of review. It
seems to me that if you are genuinely concerned about the rights
of women the obvious argument to make is that even under a
higher standard review the statutory rape laws are valid. But you
did not take that course. You suggested the Court should go back
to the old law, which had permitted sex discrimination to flourish.

  In your brief, you call on the higher standard as amoebic, and
you said it was in the "Twilight Zone" which are generally consid-
ered to be, I think, disparaging, perhaps even derogatory, ways of
referring to a constitutional requirement that made an enormous
difference in any discrimination against women in our society.

  So do you think the Court should go back to uphold statutes that
discriminate by sex if there is any plausible reason for the distinc-
tion? *

  Judge SOUTER. No. That is not my position. My position which
was described in that, which was raised as an advocate in that
brief, went to a problem which is a problem that is still with us. It
is a problem which anyone who is concerned about sex discrimina-
tion and the appropriate standard of review, I think has got to
face.

  What we are dealing with when we are asking what is the appro-
priate standard of review in an equal protection case is what kind
of pragmatic approach should we adopt in order to find whether
there is or is not a defensible classification?

  As you have pointed out, we have come up with, or the courts
have come up with basically three tiers of review, so that the
courts do not have to reinvent the wheel in every case.

  Economic matters get the lowest scrutiny, and racial matters get
the highest. The difficulty which has bedeviled the middle scrutiny
test, under which classifications of sex and illegitimacy have been
examined, is the looseness of the test.
                                                76

  The rational basis test is fairly easy to understand. The strict
scrutiny test is fairly easy to understand but the middle scrutiny
test requires the court to determine whether there is a substantial
relationship to an important governmental objective in deciding
whether or not a discrimination, a classification on the basis of sex
is appropriate.

  What is unfortunate about that standard of review is that it
leaves an enormous amount of leeway to the discretion of the court
that is doing the reviewing. The history of the middle-tier test illus-
trates this because we know there are examples, both State and
Federal, in which the middle-tier test, in fact, has been treated as
nothing more than the first-tier rational basis test--the lowest
basis for scrutiny.

  I think the question that has got to be faced is whether there can
be devised a middle-tier test providing a higher level of scrutiny for
these classifications on the basis of sex and illegitimacy that does
not suffer from the capacity of a court, as a practical matter, to
read it back down to the lowest level of scrutiny, if it is inclined to
do so.

  The trouble with the middle-tier test is that it is not a good,
sound protection. It is too loose.

  Senator KENNEDY. I--excuse me.
  Judge SOUTER. No, I was just going to add, that has nothing to do
with the question of whether sex discrimination should receive
heightened scrutiny. I think that is to compare sex discriminations
with common economic determinations seems to me totally inap-
propriate.
  The question is, what is a workable and dependable middle-tier
standard for scrutiny.
  Senator KENNEDY. In your brief, you talk about even eliminating
that test.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I also talked about making the test more
clear and eliminating this kind of protean quantity to it.
  Senator KENNEDY. And we will include the brief in the record.
  Judge SOUTER. Surely.

                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE
          This petition for a writ of certiorari
arises from "die First Circuitfs affirmance
of an Opinion by the United States District
Court for the District of New Hampshire
granting Respondent's petition for writ of
habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241
and 225t*. The Opinions of both the Circuit
Ccrj^t and the District Court held that New
Hampshire's statutory rape law (RSA 632:1,
I-c) , under which Respondent was convicted,
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.
          The Respondent, Thomas E. Meloon, and
the proseeutrix, Susan D. Souriolle, first
met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire during
late August or early September of 1973, At
the time of this meeting, the prosecutrix
                                          90

                                  - 7-

was thirteen years of age; the Respondent
       \.

was twenty-four. On three separate occasions
thereafter, the Respondent and the prosecu-
trix engaged in consensual sexual intercourse,
Respondent was then arrested, charged,

 ndicted, and on May 21, 1974, convicted of
statutory rape pursuant to New Hampshire
RSA 632:1, I-c. (This statute was repealed
and replaced on August 6, 1975, with RSA
632-A, a gender neutral law.)

          Respondent's conviction was upheld on
direct appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, which considered and explicitly
rejected Respondent's equal protection
claims. See Appendix C. However, the
United States District Court for the District
of New Hampshire subsequently granted
Respondent a writ of habeas corpus on the
ground that New Hampshire's statutory rape
                                   91
                               - 8-

law, USA 632:1, I-c, violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. See Appendix B.

          The judgment of the District Court
was affirmed by the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit on October 31,
1977. See Appendix A.

           REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT

        I. IN HOIDING THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE'S

              TION CIAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH
              AMENDMENT, THE UNITED STATES
              COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST
              CIRCUIT HAS DECIDED A SUBSTAN-
              TIAL QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL
              IAW WHICH HAS NOT BEEN, BUT
              SHDUID BE, SETTIED BY THIS COURT.

        The law under which the Respondent was

convicted, RSA 632:1, I-c, made it unlawful

for any male to have sexual intercourse with

a female not his wife who was less than

fifteen years old. The restrict Hourt. in

                                - 10 -

These decisions present this Court with the
unique opportunity not only to address the
first impression issue of the constitution-
ality of a gender based statutory rape law
vis-a-vis the Equal Protection Clause, but
also to reanalyze and clarify the unsettled
question of what is the correct equal pro-
tection test to apply to statutory classifi-
cations based on sex.

          Few areas of the law have troubled
this Court as much in recent years as has
the problem of testing statutory classifica-
tions based on sex against the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment · There are, of course, two traditional
tests to which constitutionally challenged
statutes under the Equal Protection Clause
have been subjected -- rational basis and
strict scrutiny. Under the rational basis
                                         94

                                   - 11 -

  standard a state is entitled to make reason-
  able classifications among persons upon
4 whom benefits are conferred or burdens
  inposed, and the equal protection safeguard
  is offended only if the classification rests
  on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achieve-
  "ment of the state's objective. See, e.g.,
  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 484-485
   (1970); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420,
  425-426 (1961); and W-m -?amson v. Lee
  Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488-489 (1955)*,

            The strict scrutiny test is imposed
  if the statutory distinction is based upon
  a "suspect classification" such as race,
  alienage, or nationality, (Loving v.
  Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); Graham v.
  Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971); and Qyama
  v. California. 332 U.S. 633 (1948)) or if
  the distinction infringes a "fundamental
                                           95

                                - 12 -

interest." Dunn v. Blumstein, ^05 U.S. 330
 (1972); and Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S.
535 (19^2) . To successfully withstand the
strict scrutiny test, a state must demon-
strate a "compelling state interest" in
creating the challenged classifications.
Skinner v. Oklahoma, supra.

          Where the statutory classification
under consideration has been based on sex,
however, this Court has been unwilling to
apply either of the traditional tests.
Instead, the Court has resorted to an
amorphous "substantial relation cest
which requires more heightened scrutiny
than would be applied under -the rational
basis standard, but less strinjrent scrutiny
than is applied to suspect legislation.

          T: r^^^le-tier approach began
to evolve in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71
                                      96

                                 - 13 -

 (1971) . The Court, in striking down a

probate statute which gave males a pre-

ferred position as executors, stated:

          "A classification 'must be
          reasonable, not arbitrary,
          and must rest upon some
          ground of difference having
          a fair and substantial rela-
          tion to the object of the
          legislation, so that all
          persons similarly circum-
          stanced Shall be treated
          alike.ftT Reed v. Reed,
          supra, at 76. (citation
          omitted)

          The rationale of the Reed decision

provided the underpinning for subsequent

holdings which invalidated statutes

employing gender as an inaccurate proxy

for more germane bases of classification

and which rejected administrative ease and

convenience as sufficiently important

objectives to justify gender-based distinc-

tions. See, Stanton v. Stan ton, t*21 U.S.

7 (1975); Weinberger v. Wisenfeld, t*20 U.S,
            97
      - 14 -

636 (1975); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S.

522 (1975); and Stanley v. Illinois, 405

U.S. 645 (1972). In other cases the Court,

applying in some instances the traditional

rational basis test and in others the sub-
stantial relation test of Reed, found that

certain classifications challenged as

sexually discriminatory were in fact based

on functional or circumstantial differences

between the sexes; therefore no violation

of the Equal Protection Clause existed.

See, General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,

U.S.  , 97 S. Ct. 401 (1976);

Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975);

Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974); and

Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974).

          In Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S.
677 (1973), four Justices went so far as

to conclude that sex should be regarded as
       98

- 15 -

a suspect classification. Since Frontiero,

, however, the Court has not only declined to

hold that sex is a suspect class, but it has

significantly retreated from that position.

See, Califano v. Goldfarb,  U.S. ,

"97 S. Ct. 1021 (1977); General Electric Co.

v. Gilbert, supra; Craig v. Boren, M29 U.S.

190 (1976); and Mathews v. Lucas, t*27 U.S.

495 (1976).
         The most relevant precedent for the ;

instant case is Craig v. Boren, supra, the

only Supreme Court gender-based discrimina-

tion case concerning a criminal statute.

In Craig, the Court examined and struck

down an Oklahoma statute which prohibited

the sale of 3,2% beer to males under the

age of 21 and females under the age of 18.

The majority applied the substantial rela-

tion test from Reed, but three Justices
       99
- 16 -

expressed outward concern with this standard.

Justice Powell» in a concurring opinion,

indicated that the rational basis test

should take on a "sharper focus" when

'addressing a gender-based classification,

but he balked at characterizing the new

test as an independent "middle-tier"

approach. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190,

S. Ct. 451, 464 (1976). In separate         /'

dissenting opinions, both Chief Justice

Burger and Justice Rehnquist expressed

their position that gender based cases,

like all cases where no suspect classifica-

tion or fundamental interest is involved,

should be tested by the traditional rational

basis standard. Craig v. Boren, supra, at

466, 467, 469. Justice Rehnquist went on

to express his concern that the substantial

relation test is "so diaphanous and elastic
                                    100
                              - 17 -

as to invite subjective judicial preferences
or prejudices relating to particular types
of ^legislation . . . ." Craig v. Boren,
supra, at 467, 468.

         In the instant case the Court of
Appeals was troubled by the amoebic quality
of the substantial relation test. Chief
Judge Coffin comments that it is "hardly a
precise standard," and he worries that "we'
must decide the constitutionality of the
New Hampshire statute under a test that to
some indeterminate extent requires more of
a connection between classification and
governmental objective than that of the
minimal rationality standard." Meloon v.
Helgemoe, supra, at 604.

         Despite the First Circuit's misgivings
over the imprecision of the Reed substantial
relation test, the Court found thav the New
                                   101

                               - 18 -

Hampshire statute could not pass muster
uneler that test. This decision is made
even more suspect by the First Circuit's
suggestion that the Court would not have
struck down the statute under the
"minimal rationality test," Meloon v.
Helgemoe, supra, at 606.

        In sum, this Court has created a new
equal protection test which resides some-
where in the "twilight zone" between the
rationale basis and strict scrutiny tests.
This new standard lacks definition, shape,
or precise limits. The instant case is
a perfect example of what Justice
Rehnquist feared most - the abuse of a
standard so "diaphanous and elastic" as to
permit subjective judicial preferences and
orejudices concerning particular
                                       102

                                    - 19 -

legislation. The instant case represents
an opportunity for the Court to define,
shape, limit, or even eliminate the new
standard. In all events, it presents the
opportunity for the Court to correct a
situation which invites subjective
judicial judgments and possible abuses.

        Finally, as noted above, the instant
case is one of first impression. Never
has this Court weighed a gender-based
statutory rape law against an equal pro-
tection argument. The implications of
the First Circuit's Decision for all gender-
based criminal statutes and for equal
protection analysis in general are de-
vastating. The decision should not be
left to the Court of Appeals. The issue
is substantial and worthy of this Court's

         II. THE HOLDING OF THE COURT OF
                 APPEALS IS IN DIRECT CON-
                 FLICT WITH A DECISION OF THE
                 SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE
                 OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WITH
                 THE DECISIONS OF ALL OTHER
                 STATE COURTS WHICH HAVE CON-
                 SIDERED THE QUESTION.
        During the course of Respondent's

direct appeal to the New Hanpshire Supreme
Court, he first raised the issue of
whether RSA 632:l,I-c was violative of
the Equal Protection Clause. The Court
considered Respondent's argument and in a
unanimous decision explicitly rejected it*
State v. Meloon> supra» at 670, 671.

        The New Hampshire Supreme Court does
not stand alone. On the contrary, equal
protection attacks against statutory rape
laws have been universally rejected by
every state court considering the question.

                                   - 21 -

See, e.g., People v. Mackey, 46 Cal. App.
>55, 120 Cal. Rptr. 157 (1975); People v.
Green, 183 Colo. 25, 514 P.2d 769 (1973);
In re^W.E.P., 318 A.2d 286 (D.C. App. 1974);
State v. Drake, 219 N.W. 2d 492 (Iowa 1974);
In re Interest of J.D.G., 498 S.W.2d 786 (Mo,
1973); State v. Elmore, 24 Or. App. 651,
546 P.2d 1117 (1976); and Flores v. State,
69 Wis. 2d 509, 230 N.W.2d .637 (1975).

        The holding of the Court of Appeals
runs directly counter to that of the New
Hampshire Supreme Court. It is also in
conflict with the decisions of all state
courts which have considered the question.
It is a significant issue, and a significant
conflict. It is a question of law which
has not been, but should be, settled by
this Court.

  Senator KENNEDY. But you talk about clarification but you also
talk about eliminating it. My question is, do you not think that
statutes that discriminate on the basis of sex should receive very
close examination.

  Judge SOUTER. I do not think there is any question about it.
  Senator KENNEDY. I know my time is just rapidly going by. I
mention these, Judge, because these are questions of fundamental
equality and discrimination in all forms and shapes that have
been, as I mentioned earlier, a matter of enormous concern and
this country has experienced a lot of pain, a lot of tears, a lot of
blood. I do not think the American people want to go back.
  We have seen--and this is subject to many members understand-
ing--we have seen recent judgments and decisions that have been
made by the Supreme Court which many of us feel have been a sig-
nificant retreat from protections for both women and minorities.
  So it is important, at least for this Senator, to understand your
recognition of the authority and the responsibility that we, in the
Congress, have in terms of fulfilling our responsibility under the
14th amendment, clause 5, to make sure that when laws are neces-
sary that we are going to pass them. And that we are going to have
someone who is going to be sitting on the Court who is going to
recognize the importance of interpreting them to deal with the
problems of discrimination, and also who is going to give the ade-
quate remedies for the enforcement of those laws.
  That is why I am most interested in understanding your views
about it, but I appreciate your response to these questions.
  Thank you.
  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate your concerns.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to my colleague from Utah, I am a
little confused, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU say there should be a standard between
strict scrutiny and rational basis.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I suppose there has got to be. It seems to me
impossible to say that unless you are within those basically four
categories that get the very strict scrutiny--race, alienage, national
origin, fundamental rights--that there is no appropriate level of
review except that bottom level of review which is reserved for ba-
sically the most garden-variety economic distinctions.
  That kind of a position seems to me not to take into account the
variety of the importance of the interests that fall between them.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO there should be a middle level to define it
more clearly?
  Judge SOUTER. There has got to be something other than just
threshold level scrutiny.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge SOUTER. The tough thing is in writing--I have been saying
and I will say it again--the tough thing is in finding--is in writing
a test that does not have the undue flexibility in the middle.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you.
  I will yield to my colleague.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                      107
  I think you have more than adequately answered the concerns
that Senator Kennedy has raised with regard to these issues, but I
would like to just clarify them just a little bit, if we can.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. I would like to just make sure I correctly have
the procedural history, say, of the EEOC case, the case regarding
the racial data collection and the briefs you filed in that case.
  As I understand it, Governor Thomson refused to supply the
EEOC with the racial, ethnic data information on State employees
about 1973.
  Judge SOUTER. I believe that was the first year, 1972 or 1973, yes.
  Senator HATCH. Who was the attorney general at that time?
  Judge SOUTER. My esteemed former colleague, Senator Rudman.
I would not want to suggest that Senator Rudman counseled any
executive decision on that.
  Senator HATCH. NO. I am not trying to embarrass Senator
Rudman here. But the point is that as I understand it Senator
Rudman was then the attorney general when the Department of
Justice sued the State of New Hampshire for this information in
1975?
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. And as I understand, his name and Assistant At-
torney General Edward A. Haffer, were on the answer to the Fed-
eral Government's lawsuit and they signed that particular answer,
if you can recall.
  Judge SOUTER. I believe that was correct.
  Senator HATCH. Was your name on that answer?
  Judge SOUTER. I do not remember. I do not specifically remem-
ber.
  Senator HATCH. The answer is, no, I do not think you were.
  Judge SOUTER. YOU are a better student of my history than I am.
  Senator HATCH. The names of the same two persons, Senator
Rudman and Assistant Attorney General Haffer appear on the
State's memorandum in support of the cross motion for summary
judgment which was filed, as I recall, December 9, 1975. I think
you would agree with that.
  Judge SOUTER. I recall that.
  Senator HATCH. The Federal district court, later in December
1975, then granted summary judgment for the Federal Govern-
ment. Now, who filed the State's notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit?
  Judge SOUTER. My best recollection is that the notice of appeal
probably had been filed before I became attorney general, but I
would have to check the dates.
  Senator HATCH. Again, it was Senator Rudman and Mr. Haffer, I
believe it was.
  Now, I believe that the notice was filed on December 31, 1975,
and your name was not on it?
  Judge SOUTER. That is right. I was still deputy at that time.
  Senator HATCH. On what date did you become attorney general
of New Hampshire?
  Judge SOUTER. I think it was January 20 of the next year, 1976.
  Senator HATCH. SO by the time that you became head of the
office of attorney general of New Hampshire, the Governor had re-
                                      108
fused to comply with Federal data requests and the Federal Gov-
ernment had sued the State to obtain the data and the State's
answer and legal arguments had already been fully set forth in the
Federal district court and the State had lost in that court.

  And the State's attorney general, our current colleague, Senator
Rudman, had already noticed an appeal and all of this occurred
before you became attorney general.

  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Now, is it accurate to say that the State's
appellate brief filed in the first circuit and the State's petition for
certiorari, after the first circuit upheld the lower court, generally
tracked the arguments made in the district court filing, while Sen-
ator Rudman was attorney general?
  Judge SOUTER. That is my understanding.
  Senator HATCH. That is true.
  Now, I am pointing out who was attorney general at what stage
of the proceedings. I am not trying to suggest that you should seek
to disassociate yourself from the briefs. You clearly have not done
that.
  But I just want this episode and its perspective because I think
that has to be said.
  Then I would like to also add that you and then attorney gener-
al, my good friend Senator Rudman, you were both advocates and
you have made that point here.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. It was your duty to do the best you could for
your client who was, in this case, the Governor and the State of
New Hampshire. And as such, it is not only appropriate but it is a
part of your responsibility to advance the plausible arguments to
try and win the case, is that a fair statement?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. I notice that these briefs asserted--I thought
that this was fairly ingenious--that these briefs asserted the right
to privacy for State employees not to reveal their racial identity
and the briefs based it on Griswold v. Connecticut.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. Which, of course, was a 1965 decision and has
been raised earlier by our distinguished chairman.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, this argument, I might add for the benefit
of my colleagues who are concerned that you might not be an advo-
cate of the right of privacy, this argument extended far beyond Roe
v. Wade with regard to the right of privacy, in those briefs cited,
because the line of privacy cases cited grew out of the marriage re-
lationship and the personal interest in procreation.
  But as a critic of the Roe y. Wade decision, which I am--I am not
the least bit troubled by its inclusion in your brief.
  As an advocate, you have to make plausible arguments based on
then current case law, and the principles you find there. I have to
give my old friend, Senator Rudman, a lot of credit, and you as
well, for having the ingenuity for making the arguments based
upon Griswold v. Connecticut.
  Judge SOUTER. We did the best we could, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. YOU sure did.
                                      109
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. YOU were wrong, but you made very, very good
arguments. That is all I can say. I would be more concerned if as a
judge you had accepted that inventive argument, you see.
  Now, let me just ask one other question. When you did become
attorney general, did your office comply and provide the racial and
ethnic identification data in response to the EEOC surveys?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes; I think by that time an order had been en-
tered against the State.
  Senator HATCH. SO once you had taken a shot at it and tried to
change the law and, as best you could, with innovative arguments
in representing your client as an advocate and as one who inherit-
ed the case from prior ingenious advocates--and I say that with re-
spect--you complied with the law once you lost.
  Judge SOUTER. When the case was over, it was over.
  Senator HATCH. It was over. Well, I think that makes the case
pretty well that it is improper for us to try to use your position as
an advocate to determine whether or not you have--or to deter-
mine your own beliefs as you exist here today as the nominee for
the Supreme Court.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I think the Senator from Utah has con-
vinced me we should not confirm Warren Rudman to the Supreme
Court. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Actually, I think
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I would stipulate to that.
  Senator HATCH. YOU will stipulate to that. [Laughter.]
  Actually, I think he would make quite a great Supreme Court
Justice. I would be worried every time a case came down, however.
  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say I think he would be a great
Justice, too. I thought it was a question of him against me, and
under those circumstances. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. I wouldn't push that if I were you. I know
Rudman too well.
  With regard to the literacy case, the law of New Hampshire had
basically, in your opinion, been upheld before you tried that case.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes; it had. The use of a literacy test for a nondis-
criminatory purpose had been affirmed by the Supreme Court.
  Senator HATCH. AS I understand it, the New Hampshire Consti-
tution required all voters to be able to read and write and under-
stand English.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. It was a requirement, and I don't think this
was the point of any question so far. But needless to say, no one
had authority to suspend the imposition of that literacy test except
a court of competent jurisdiction.
  Senator HATCH. Well, as I understand it also, that law required
voters to be 21 years of age, and it restricted absentee voting to
people who were actually outside of the State, at least as I under-
stand it.
  Judge SOUTER. I believe that is correct.
  Senator HATCH. The Department of Justice took the position that
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed all of these practices.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
                                      110

   Senator HATCH. SO when you and Senator Rudman took that
matter on, you had current law that seemed to support you.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
   Senator HATCH. In addition, you were both, as advocates, as at-
torneys general, if you will, you were both required by your oath of
office to uphold the New Hampshire Constitution and statutory
law.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes; we were.
   Senator HATCH. In fact, it would have been unseemly if you had
not tried to uphold the constitution that had been enacted by elect-
ed representatives in your State.
  Judge SOUTER. The only case, Senator, in which our responsibil-
ity would have been different from the way we saw it would have
been a case in which the national and State constitutions clearly
conflicted. And in those circumstances, our oaths would have re-
quired us, if we so believed--and we believed that there was no
reasonable argument that could have been made to defend the
State position--our obligation would have been to state that to the
court. We did not find ourselves to believe that we were in that po-
sition.
  Senator HATCH. IS it fair to say constitutionally that at that time
back in 1970, the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act was
being legitimately disputed at that particular time?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. That was being litigated, and it was a final
determination on that, or at least on the issues that concerned us,
came with Oregon v. Mitchell, which was decided, I think, about 4
months after our own State case.
  Senator HATCH. It was disputed, basically, on the principles of
federalism arguments.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes; it was.
  Senator HATCH. All right. Well, as I understand it, the district
court itself expressed some doubt about the issue but said that the
act was "probably" constitutional.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes; they were at an injunction stage, and they
made that judgment.
  Senator HATCH. I also understand that you and Senator Rudman,
then attorney general of the State of New Hampshire, complied
with all aspects of the Justice Department suit as soon as the con-
stitutionality of the act was settled by the Supreme Court.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. My recollection is that after Oregon v. Mitch-
ell came down I believe there was a joint stipulation filed by the
State and Federal counsel, which ended the case.
  Senator HATCH. We can go through a lot of questions on the
other point that Senator Kennedy raised with regard to the gender
issue, but let me just say this: In its petition for writ of certiorari,
your State in that particular case did refer to the Supreme Court's
case laws evincing a "middle-tier" approach and asked the Su-
preme Court to make it clearer and more precise and, in addition,
to uphold your statutory rape law.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, there is simply nothing here giving rise to
any legitimate concern, as far as I am concerned, about you be-
cause the brief made reasonable arguments back in 1977 seeking to
                                      Ill

construe precedent in a manner which would uphold your own
State's statutory rape law.

  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. A May 5, 1987, opinion of the New Hampshire
Supreme Court, which you joined in, made reference to the so-
called middle-tier level of heightened scrutiny with respect to
gender. And so, even on the bench, you acknowledged this middle-
tier gender characterization.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. I think I have to say that I don't see any reason
to criticize you on the basis of any of those matters. As a matter of
fact, I see every reason to say that in the fight for principle, you
may be wrong but you fight for it. You may be right but you fight
for it. And you are an effective advocate and an ingenious repre-
sentative of the people and, I might say, a clever and good writer of
the law.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. But that once the decision is made, you immedi-
ately followed those decisions.
  Judge SOUTER. We did.
  Senator HATCH. I don't know what more we could ask for in
somebody who is here sitting as a nominee for the Supreme Court
of the United States of America.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. I want to compliment you for it because, you
know, let's just be honest. If we are going to start criticizing advo-
cates because they advocated for people who may have been wrong,
we would hardly ever have an opportunity of putting a criminal
lawyer on the Supreme Court, or any other bench, for that matter.
Nor would we have an opportunity of putting people who actually
go to bat for some pretty reprehensible people in our society and
try and uphold their rights, which is time honored, one of the most
important obligations of any attorney worth his or her salt. So, you
know, I don't see any problems at all with you as an advocate. As a
matter of fact, I would be surprised if you had not advocated the
way you did at the time. It would have been nice if you had known
how the Supreme Court was going to rule in advance.
  Judge SOUTER. I could have been a very successful lawyer.
  Senator HATCH. Well, you are also going to be in a position
where I think you are going to know how it is going to rule in ad-
vance in the future. That will be great.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, you have sat on a State trial court, a State
supreme court. You have had tremendously broad experience. You
have heard domestic relations cases, right?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. Child custody cases?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. Criminal law cases?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. Divorce cases?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. In fact, you have heard cases of employment
law.
                                      112
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. YOU have heard cases involving almost every
aspect of human endeavor.
  Judge SOUTER. Anything that can come before a trial court of
general jurisdiction.
  Senator HATCH. Yes, and you have heard them in a more refined
sense with arguments on both sides in the appellate courts that
you have been on.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, I have.
  Senator HATCH. All right. Well, having had that experience and
now sitting on an intermediate Federal court, the highest court
under the Supreme Court of the United States, could you describe
for the committee the process by which you have reached your de-
cisions in cases as they come before you? It is a generalized ques-
tion, but I would like you to give us the benefit of how you go
through deciding these cases.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, do you want me to refer to the trial court
experience as well as appellate court?
  Senator HATCH. NO, just the appellate experience I think would
be fine at this point, since it is closely parallel to the Supreme
Court experience I hope you will have.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, the process is one which helps to discipline
the mind as we go through it. I will leave aside the question of de-
termining whether there should be discretionary review in a given
case and start with the point at which the case is docketed before
the court.
  In the normal course, sometime in the month before the case is
going, to be argued, we get a set of briefs. My practice would be
usually in the week or the weekend before the argument to read
those briefs through, to make notes on the covers of the briefs of
questions that I want to ask. And also, as a matter of curiosity, to
try to settle a lawyer's argument, I engaged in a practice for the
last couple of years of trying to get some sense in a way that I
could measure of the effect of the oral argument on me, which
would come after the briefs had been read.
  What I would do after I had read the briefs and noted the ques-
tions that I knew that I wanted to ask counsel, I would make a no-
tation on my docket list, which I kept in my own file, of what I
thought was the strongest position at the time, a kind of first, even
prestraw-poll indication of where I thought I might come out on
the case.
  Following the oral argument in the case, I would then compare
my determination after oral argument with that first indication
that I had put on the docket list. One of the things that I wish I
had done before I came down here and I didn't think to do was to
try to go down to my chambers and pull out my old docket lists
and tabulate those points at which I had had some change of deci-
sion from the preliminary to the postargument decision. But I did
change my mind in enough cases so that I remember there are
enough little x's in the margin to indicate that the second look
after argument suggested something that the first look before argu-
ment had not, to indicate to me that oral argument was a matter
of substantial importance to me in deciding cases.
                                      113

  I would then, following that oral argument, of course, go through
a preliminary discussion of the case and a preliminary vote with
the other justices. We would decide how the case probably would
come out, and the case in the New Hampshire Supreme Court
would be assigned randomly. And if I got the case, I would then
start working on the opinion.

  The way I happen to work on opinions was to ask a law clerk
whom I would assign to that particular case to draft an opinion
which followed a rough outline that I would give the clerk of the
points that I wanted to cover and the basic reasoning that I wanted
to go through. What I wanted the clerk to do was not to write me
an opinion which I was necessarily going to use--because, in fact,
on the New Hampshire Supreme Court I never did use a clerk's
draft ultimately. What I wanted the clerk to do was, in effect, to
make the run-through, help me with the research, reduce down the
amount of reading that I personally had to do of the most impor-
tant authorities, and to give a further preliminary look at whether
there was some flaw in our reasoning that I was not catching or
that the other judges in the majority with me were not catching.

  After I would get the clerk's draft back--we may or may not
have argued about it in the meantime. But after the clerk's draft
came back, I would then work my way through the briefs again. I
would read the portions of the record sent up to us that were ger-
mane to the decision. I would then go through my own research
process of rereading cases, even though I might think I was famil-
iar with them, that the parties had relied on.

  At that point, I would make a final assessment myself as to
whether there was any reason to change my view from what it had
been when the court voted. If there was, I would either go back to
the court or I would draft an opinion indicating the change and cir-
culate that and explain why I was doing it. If there was no change,
I would then write my own opinion. I would revise it an unfortu-
nate number of times. And then I would let the clerk have a go at
it again, and the clerk would try to tear it to pieces. Usually, an-
other clerk would review it then, and ultimately it would circulate
to the rest of the court, at which point I might or might not be in
trouble. But that was at least the process that I went through up to
there.

  Senator HATCH. Well, that is good. I have other questions I would
like to ask. I have about 10 minutes left, but I think I will just re-
serve that time and we will move on from here. But thank you,
Judge. It has been great to be able to ask a few of these questions.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think it may be appropriate now for us to take
a short break. But before we do, let me ask my colleagues to think
about it while we are on break. We have 2% hours' worth of ques-
tioning left. I indicated we would stop around 6 o'clock, which is
my preference this evening. But I would like my colleagues to
think about that, and we will come in in the morning, and those
who haven't had their first round would start off when we started
in the morning. But I would just like to ask my colleagues to think
about that while we take a break.
  We will have a recess until 4:30, at which time we still start
promptly at 4:30.
                                      114

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, would you like a soda or some coffee or anything?
  Judge SOUTER. No, I am fine. Thank you, sir. I was offered any-
thing I needed out back.
  The CHAIRMAN. We have done a little bit of a check here and I
think this is consistent with my colleagues and the White House, I
think we are all in agreement, which we usually always are.
[Laughter.]
  That is that this is how we will proceed. I checked with the rank-
ing member, Senator Thurmond, because we do not do anything he
does not agree to, and this is what we will do: We will go next to
Senator Metzenbaum, then to Senator Simpson, and then to Sena-
tor DeConcini, and we will stop after Senator DeConcini, and by
that time we will have a consensus.
  Is there a preference when you wish to convene tomorrow morn-
ing, somewhere between 9 and 10? Before we close out, I will have
that, because a lot of the press are asking. I do not--and we have
discussed this--I do not intend to go late tomorrow afternoon. We
will go into the middle of the afternoon, to the 5 o'clock area, but it
will not be a late night tomorrow, and I expect, based on that, as
we indicated before, have a reasonable prospect of finishing up
early Monday and then begin with our witnesses, but we will see
from there.
  Again, I thank you. You obviously have one advantage that most
witnesses do not have, Judge. You are accustomed to sitting for a
long time, and you
  Judge SOUTER. That is the third lesson I learned as a judge.
[Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU do it with great aplomb, your physical con-
stitution as well as your understanding of the Constitution are
matched.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me turn to my colleague from Ohio Sen-
ator Metzenbaum, for his questioning.
  Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, I want to focus on your view of really what is at
stake in the abortion debate. Now, we write the laws in Congress,
the Court interprets the laws, but we all must be aware that the
laws affect the personal lives and the hopes and the dreams of the
people who must live with the laws we make.
  I want to start to talk with you on a personal level, not as a con-
stitutional scholar nor as a lawyer. This year, I held hearings on
legislation that would codify the principles of Roe v. Wade. I heard
stories from two women who had had illegal abortions prior to
1973. They were women about your age. They told horrifying sto-
ries.
  One woman was the victim of a brutal rape and she could not
bear raising a child from that rape along side her own two chil-
dren. Another woman, who was poor and alone, self-aborted. It is a
horrible story, just a horrible story, with knitting needles and a
bucket.
                                         115

  I heard from a man whose mother died from an illegal abortion
when he was 2 years old, after doctors told her that she was not
physically strong enough to survive the pregnancy.

  I will tell you, Judge Souter, that the emotion that those people
still feel, after more than 20 years, is very real, sufficiently strong
to have conveyed it to those of us who heard their testimony. Each
woman risked her life to do what she felt she had to do. One of
those women paid the price.

  My real question to you is not how you would rule on Roe v.
Wade or any other particular case coming before the Court. But
what does a woman face, when she has an unwanted pregnancy, a
pregnancy that may be the result of rape or incest or failed contra-
ceptives or ignorance of basic health information, and I would just
like to get your own view and your own thoughts of that woman's
position under those circumstances.

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, your question comes as a surprise to me.
I was not expecting that kind of question, and you have made me
think of something that I have not thought of for 24 years.

  When I was in law school, I was on the board of freshmen advis-
ers at Harvard College. I was a proctor in a dormitory at Harvard
College. One afternoon, one of the freshmen who was assigned to
me, I was his adviser, came to me and he was in pretty rough emo-
tional shape and we shut the door and sat down, and he told me
that his girlfriend was pregnant and he said she is about to try to
have a self-abortion and she does not know how to do it. He said
she is afraid to tell her parents what has happened and she is
afraid to go to the health services, and he said will you talk to her,
and I did.

  I know you will respect the privacy of the people involved, and I
will not try to say what I told her. But I spent 2 hours in a small
dormitory bedroom that afternoon, in that room because that was
the most private place we could get so that no one in the next suite
of rooms could hear, listening to her and trying to counsel her to
approach her problem in a way different from what she was doing,
and your question has brought that back to me.

  I think the only thing I can add to that is I know what you were
trying to tell me, because I remember that afternoon.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I appreciate your response. I think
it indicates that you have empathy for the problem. In your writ-
ings, as a matter of fact, you reveal real empathy for those who are
morally opposed to abortion.

   For instance, in 1986, as a State supreme court justice, you wrote
a special concurrence in a wrongful birth case called Smith v. Coat,
outlining, in your words, how a physician with conscientious scru-
ples against abortion--this is a quote:

   How a physician with conscientious scruples against abortion and the testing and
counseling that may inform an abortion decision can discharge his professional obli-
gation, without engaging in procedures that his religious or moral principles con-
demn.

  As a matter of fact, that was sort of dictum. That was dictum in
the case, it was not necessary.

  As attorney general, you filed a brief in Coe v. Hooker, which em-
phasized that^

  Thousands of New Hampshire citizens possess a very strongly held and deep-
seeded moral belief that abortion is the killing of unborn children.
                                      116

  That brief went on to conclude,

   It is not accurate to say that the moral feelings of other individuals and groups,
both public and private, may not constitutionally interfere with a woman's other-
wise unrestricted right to decide to have an abortion.

  I start off saying it is not accurate to say that. Now, you obviously
indicated a concern for the doctor with conscientious scruples
against abortion, you indicated your concern about feelings of indi-
viduals and groups, both public and privately. My concern is do you
have the same degree of empathy for the woman who must make a
difficult decision when faced with an unwanted pregnancy. That is
really the thrust of my concern, and I think the thrust of the
concern, frankly, Judge Souter, of millions of American women, not
really wanting to know how you will vote on a particular case, but
wanting to know whether you can empathize with their problem.

  Judge SOUTER. If they were to ask me whether I could, I would
ask them to imagine what it was like to be in that room that fall
afternoon that I described to you. That is an experience which has
not been on my mind, because it has not had to be, but I learned
that afternoon what was at stake.

  I hope I have learned since that afternoon what is at stake on
both sides of this controversy. You mentioned my opinion in the
Smith v. Cody case. I do not know whether that was dictum or not.
I did not think it was at the time.

  What I thought I was addressing at the time was as moral dilem-
ma which had been created not unnecessarily, but which had nec-
essarily been raised by the majority opinion of my court.

  If I were to generalize from that concurrence in Smith v. Cody, it
would be that I believe I, indeed, can empathize with the moral
force of the people whom I addressed, and I can with equal empa-
thy appreciate the moral force of people on the other side of that
controversy.

  Senator METZENBAUM. My staff just points out to me that each
year almost 3.5 million women face that problem of an unwanted
pregnancy, much like the woman that you mentioned.

  Everybody talks about Roe v. Wade as a case. I do not think of it
as a case. I think of it as those witnesses who came before my com-
mittee. I think of it as women generally. I think of it as my own
daughters, who are married, and I can imagine a situation where
they might need to have or want to have an abortion. Other
women less fortunate than they would not be able to go to a differ-
ent State, if there were no law.

  I think about what would happen if there were no constitutional
protection, and I ask you not how you vote on the case, but what
are your thoughts as to what would happen to those women in this
country who might be able to go, if they had the money, to State x,
but not get an abortion, not be able to stay in State y, because that
State prohibits abortions.

  My concern is what does Judge Souter think about this moral,
and it goes beyond being a moral question, it becomes a really
heart-wrenching decision that actually goes beyond morality, it
goes to the very heart of living, the kind of living that people expe-
rience.

  Judge SOUTER. I think I have to go back to something that I said
to all of the members of the committee when I was speaking at the
very beginning, before my testimony this afternoon.
                                         117

  If I have learned one thing, I have learned that whatever we do
on any appellate court is not, just as you said it was not, just a
case. It affects someone and it changes someone's life, no matter
what we do.

  One of the consequences undeniably of the situation that you de-
scribe would be an inconsistency of legal opportunity throughout
this country. Some States would go one way, others would go an-
other. Some would fund abortions, some would not fund abortions.
There is no question that that is a consequence that has to be
faced.

  I do not think that, any more than any other given fact, as tragic
as that fact may be, is sufficient to decide a case. We can never
decide a case totally that way, and I know you are not suggesting
otherwise.

  But you remember what I said is the second lesson that I learned
as a trial judge, that knowing that any decision we make is going
to affect a life and perhaps many lives, we had better use every re-
source of our minds and our hearts and every strength that we
have to get it right. It is the imperative for conscientious judging.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I think you are a very sincere man
and I think you are a very moral man. What is bothering me,
maybe some others as well, is that you have already expressed con-
cern for the conscientious scruples of physicians in connection with
abortion, you have expressed concern for the moral feelings of
others in connection with abortions.

  The real concern is, would the conscientious scruples of a physi-
cian or the moral feelings of others override a woman's decision
when and whether or not to have her child.

  Judge SOUTER. There is no question that the decision about the
future of Roe v. Wade does not rest upon an assessment of a physi-
cian's moral scruples. The issue of Roe v. Wade is one which, as
you know, on the merits I cannot comment on.

  But there is one thing that I can say, and I do not know how else
to say it, is that whatever its proper resolution may be, it is an
issue. It is not simply a label for one view, whether that view be in
favor of continuing Roe v. Wade or in favor of overruling it.

  You are asking me at this point have I demonstrated, can I point
to something on the record that demonstrates as kind of equality of
empathy on either side, and I think the only thing that I can, with-
out self-serving rhetoric, say to you is I have talked and I have
counseled with someone on the other side.

  I have been the trustee of a hospital which has opened its facili-
ties to people on the other side, people who did not agree with
these conscientious doctors, and to the extent that I have a record
that goes behind the legal issue in the case, I think you may prop-
erly look to that. And you may properly ask, and I hope you will
ask yourself, as you and the other members of this committee
listen to me over the course of the next few days, you may properly
ask whether, on other issues generally, I am open enough to listen.

  What you want to avoid is a judge who will not listen, and I will
ask you when these hearings are over to make a judgment on me
as to whether I will listen or not. I think I have a record as a judge
which indicates that I will, and after you and the other members of

        39-454--91-
                                          118

this committee have finished examining it, I will ask you to judge
me on that basis.

   Senator METZENBAUM. We will.
   In Griswold v. Connecticut, Justice Douglas articulated the very
important privacy concerns that were at stake if Connecticut fully
enforced its anticontraceptive statute. He asked, "Would we allow
the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for
telltale signs of the use of contraceptives." This idea is obviously
repugnant to everyone.
   Surely, the Court has to concern itself with the problems of en-
forcing statutes regulating reproductive rights. The Court must be
willing to reap what it sows, if it overturns Roe and permits States
to once again criminalize abortion.
   I do not have to tell you, until last November, what was occur-
ring in Romania, the draconian regime, the manner in which they
enforced their criminal abortion laws, each month police would
enter factories to examine women to determine if they were preg-
nant. No question, that would not happen in this country.
   Romanian women who had miscarried were interrogated to make
sure they had not had an abortion. We know that will not happen.
But if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe and a State passed
a statute criminalizing abortion, would it then be constitutional to
put a woman in jail for obtaining an abortion?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the only answer to that, Senator, is a ref-
erence back to the laws that preceded Roe. We know that in my
own State there were misdemeanor statutes on the book for procur-
ing an abortion. And it was exactly such statutes as that that Roe
rendered unenforceable.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Excuse me, I did not mean to be rude.
  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say it was exactly such statutes as
that that Roe rendered unenforceable.
  Senator METZENBAUM. NOW, according to news reports at the
time you were attorney general, you opposed repealing New Hamp-
shire's criminal abortion statutes which had been passed before
Roe v. Wade.
  The legislative archives of the bill that would have repealed the
criminal statutes contain a memorandum from the attorney gener-
al's office outlining the effects of Roe v. Wade. Although it is un-
clear when the memo was written, it was likely written soon after
Roe was decided in 1973, although I am not certain about that.
  At that time, you were deputy attorney general. The memo con-
cluded that "the effect of the Supreme Court decision is to invali-
date RSA 585:12, 585:13, and to make RSA 585:14 a nullity."
  Are you familiar with that memo?
  Judge SOUTER. I do not recall the memo, no.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Did you agree then, or do you believe now
that the Supreme Court's decision in Roe rendered the New Hamp-
shire criminal statutes unconstitutional?
  Judge SOUTER. The fact is I cannot give you a categorical answer
to that. To begin with, it is an issue that I have not even given
thought to for, I guess, 17 years and I do not recall the extent to
which I may have been aware of that memorandum at the time.
  The further reason for the difficulty and a categorical answer is
that you may recall that there are questions about the effect of Roe
                                      119

or the Roe-type decisions depending on the form of the State stat-
utes in question.

  Now, I am going to say something from memory and it may be
inaccurate, so I want you to take it with that disclaimer. But my
recollection is that the Court's indication of the enforceability of
the statute in Roe v. Wade was different from its indication of the
enforceability that came out of Doe v. Bolton.

  Quite frankly, Senator, without a reexamination of precisely
what they were saying on whether the statute remained partially
enforceable to the extent allowable under Roe v. Wade as opposed
to becoming totally unenforceable, I would have to go back and
reread those carefully and parse the New Hampshire statutes,
which I have not done.

  It is--in one sense I think we are inclined to say, well, that
ought to be an easy question, and I do not think it is an easy ques-
tion.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I will change the subject.
  The day after President Bush nominated you to the Supreme
Court, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu called in an advo-
cate for the right, conservative movement and said that you
would--to assure him and the right, that those on the right would
be very happy and that Bush selected you over better known con-
servatives. He called a man by the name of Pat McGuigan. Mr.
McGuigan works for or is involved with something called the Coali-
tions for America; Paul Weirich, national chairman; Eric Licht is
the president; library, court/social issues; Stanton, defense and for-
eign policy; Kingston, budget and economic policy; 721 Group, judi-
cial and legal policy; Siena Group; Catholic Coalition; the Omega
Alliance; Young Activist Coalition; Resistance Support Alliance;
Freedom Fighter Policy; Jewish Conservative Alliance.
  At that meeting, according to the memo that Mr. McGuigan then
wrote to Paul Weirich and a number of others, it was stated that
Sununu asked, how are you doing? I replied, well, John, you guys
could have hit a home run if you had picked Edith Jones, a Texas
judge. Instead, you hit a blooper single which has barely cleared
the mitt of the first baseman who is backpedaling furiously and
almost caught the ball.
  Sununu smiled and replied, Pat, you are wrong. This is a home
run and the ball is still ascending; in fact, it is just about to leave
Earth orbit.
  It was not too long after that the Coalition for America an-
nounced they were fully supporting your nomination. That original
memo that I mentioned specifically provided that there were to be
absolutely no leaks allowed.
  Judge Souter, what does John Sununu know about you that we
do not know? Can you tell us what conversations you have had
with him or with others at the White House either before the nom-
ination or since the nomination concerning any matter of issues,
points of view, that make it possible for Mr. Sununu to say that it
is a home run; the ball is still ascending?
  Judge SOUTER. I have never discussed the issue in question with
Governor Sununu. After Governor Sununu came to Washington, I
did not see him until one day last December. I think it may have
been around the 11th or the 12th. I was in Washington that day in
                                          120

connection with the nomination or the possible nomination to the
court of appeals.

   The Governor invited me to lunch and I did have lunch with
him. We did not discuss any substantive issue that his memoran-
dum referred to. We largely, as I recall, talked politics in New
Hampshire. I did not see the Governor again until the day before
this nomination.

   I did not have discussions with him on the issue that you re-
ferred to.

   Senator METZENBAUM. HOW about on other issues? Did you dis-
cuss other issues with John Sununu, or others at the White House
or connected with representing the White House?

  Judge SOUTER. I was going to just try to establish how far back in
time we want to go with Governor Sununu.

   Senator METZENBAUM. I did not mean to interrupt you.
  Judge SOUTER. NO. I just wanted to know how far back you want
to go in time? To the beginning?
   Senator METZENBAUM. Well, anything that would give him suffi-
cient knowledge to this kind of assurance and to call in the repre-
sentatives of the far right and to assure them that you are going to
be OK.
  Judge SOUTER. I have not discussed that issue or given any assur-
ance to Governor Sununu.
  I presume that Governor Sununu was drawing a conclusion
based on what he understood to be principles of judging* But I can
assure you that I gave no assurance to him at any time on that
matter. And I did not discuss that matter with him at any time.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Did you have any discussions with him or
any other persons at the White House concerning issues that may
or may not come before the Supreme Court?
  Judge SOUTER. The only discussion that I had with anyone at the
White House in connection with this nomination or, for that
matter the circuit nomination, was my conversation with the Presi-
dent which I think lasted about a half an hour on the afternoon
that he announced his intent to nominate me. He asked for no as-
surance on any subject.

  Senator METZENBAUM. And at the time you were appointed cir-
cuit court of appeals judge, did anybody in the White House in-
quire of you concerning any of your political views, or views con-
cerning matters that might come before the Supreme Court?

  Judge SOUTER. NO, Senator. The only conversation I had or con-
versations, I should say, plural, with anyone at the White House at
that time, was during the course of the lunch that I mentioned.
Governor Sununu--the lunch was in Governor Sununu's office. He
was there and his assistant was there; the Governor's legal counsel,
Mr. Gray, and Lee Liverman, who is on his staff.

  I was not asked for any statement of position or assurance on
any issue in that conversation.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you.
  Senator Biden, how much time do I have left?
  The CHAIRMAN. I do not know. You have 1 minute. That is just
about enough time to call Governor Sununu, who is doing a fund-
raiser in Delaware for my opponent. Maybe we can get a hold of
him.
                                      121
  Senator METZENBAUM. DO I understand that we will be in several
rounds?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. What we will do is this. We will have those
Senators who have additional questions ask them tomorrow after-
noon and/or Monday morning, or whatever the appropriate time is.
Yes, there will be an opportunity.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I do, Judge Souter, wish to inquire of you
concerning church-state issues, but time obviously does not permit
it at this moment. Thank you very much for responding to my
questions.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  We lawyers often are out doing our business, like correcting the
record. So I did want to--you will notice Senator Biden and I this
morning, as I pungently gave a comment about his quote and he
pungently spliced it back together. So I thought we would just put
the whole thing in because we both said exactly that, and it is in
the same paragraph. And we have already had that answered, I
think, now.
  But it is clear that what I said and what Senator Biden said are
the exact quote with regard to the specific attitude of questions. So
I just wanted to get that on record, because my staff was not on
vacation. They were here laboring diligently. They were not at Re-
hobeth or anywhere.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, mine were not in a hole clawing to get this
information, or however you mischaracterized it.
  Senator SIMPSON. I was talking about those poor law professors. I
think that was the part I should have clarified. Diana and the staff
were doing their work, but the poor law professors and the academ-
ics, they were clawing and scratching. We have to realize that they
have had an arduous summer and an arduous August, without
question.
  Judge SOUTER. If they were reading my opinions, they were.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, we all did a little of that. In any event,
your remarks when you spoke with hardly or nary a note at 2 p.m.
today was very impressive. I think to me, as a person who prac-
ticed law for 18 years in really what I thought of as the real
world--and it was; you know, I have represented some real weird
people, and did some real weird cases with some weird results, too,
I can tell you that. [Laughter.]
  So the thing that impressed me is to hear you able to describe
yourself and then hear you describe answers and form answers to
pretty piercing questions from Senator Biden, Ted, Howard, Orrin,
Strom. All of those--your answers come back with the lucidity of
very impressive degree.
  I have always had the peculiar view that legislating should be
done in a way--as I said earlier, in a way that is understandable to
the governed. And certainly I always had a view of the law practice
that if your clients could not understand what you had drafted for
them, what was the purpose of practicing law?
  I know that is a screwy view, but it was mine. In other words, if
the client did not know and looked at a contract that you had
                                          122

drafted and did not know what it said, what is the purpose of the
law practice?

   And I think as a judge, writing opinions, what greater purpose of
a judge is to write an opinion that the public can understand or to
answer a question in a way that the public can understand, not
just from some intellectual level, but from the gut level, from the
commonsense level?

  And that is what has been most impressive to me--to hear you
respond to these questions in a way that is extraordinarily under-
standable

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
   Senator SIMPSON [continuing]. And showing, in a hackneyed word
in these times, sensitivity and empathy. I know my friend, Howard
Metzenbaum and I know my friend, Ted Kennedy, and we get to
know each other pretty well in 12 years, and Joe Biden and Orrin
Hatch and all the men at this table, and our fine ranking member.
And we do know each other pretty well after 12 years and going
through these kinds of exercises. We have been through some
grinders here.

  The Bork thing was extraordinary in its, you know, intensity, in
what occurred, and I do not see any portent of that at all here. Yet,
my friend, Ted Kennedy, speaks with power as he gets into those
issues of--he and I are chairman and ranking--and it was more
fun when I was chairman and he was ranking, but we have done
tough work together on immigration, refugees, things filled with, I
often say, emotion, fear, guilt, and racism.

  None of us on this panel are racists. I do not know any racists in
the U.S. Senate. So it is always something that when you bang
around the edges of it, you almost want to ask the question, David
Souter, Are you a racist?

  Judge SOUTER. The answer is, no.
  Senator SIMPSON. A crazy question to ask, is it not?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, far be it for me to say that a question from
you, Senator, is crazy. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. NO, do not. Just stop right there.
  Senator HATCH. But we all agree.
  Senator SIMPSON. DO not listen to them, just go ahead.
  Judge SOUTER. In a way, I think that answer might have been
impressive to some people if I had grown up in a place with racial
problems, and some people have pointed out that I did not. The
State of New Hampshire does not have racial problems.
  So you can ask, well, what indication is there, really, as to
whether you mean it or not. And you did not provoke this thinking
on my part by your question immediately because I thought of it
before I came in here. I can think of two things to say.
  The first is something very personal and very specific to my
family. In a way, it surprises me when I look back on the years
when I was growing up that never once, ever in my house that I
can remember did I ever hear my mother or my father refer to any
human being in terms of racial or ethnic identity. I have heard all
the slang terms and I never heard them in my house.
  Now, as much as I esteem my family, I do not want to try to
make them a race of saints, but the fact is, in that respect, they
                                      123
were perfect. They were perfect in some other ways, too, but they
were in that respect.

  And if there is a kind of homely vision for America, in my mind,
it is simply the vision of my home. And I have lived long enough
and I have lived outside of my home long enough to know what the
difference is. I am glad that I am conditioned by my beginnings
and I am glad that I do not have to overcome them. I am glad that
I can have an aspiration for America which is as good as the cir-
cumstances that I came from.

  Another thing that occurred to me, and it is equally personal--
and I think that I will not offend the two people involved by saying
this--two of my closest friends in this world are sitting in the row
behind me. You have already heard from Warren Rudman. I heard
Warren Rudman talk about what it was like to be discriminated
against when he was a kid because he was Jewish. Somewhere out
there, there is somebody who is discriminating against a friend of
mine who is close enough to me to be a brother.

  And there is another friend of mine in that category in the row
behind me; you haven't heard from him today. His name is Thomas
Rath. I can remember Tom Rath telling me once years ago--I don't
know why, I don't know how it came up. I remember him telling
me about his grandparents, and his grandparents remembered the
days when there were help-wanted signs up around the city of
Boston that said "No Irish need apply." And that meant them.

  So if you want to know whether I have got the vision, if you will,
behind the answer to my question, I will be content to have you
look to my friends.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I come from Wyoming, and people think
that I don't have the sensitivity about race. I remember I was at a
baseball game with Coretta Scott King. It was the World Series in
Kansas City several years ago, and she said, "I don't know much
about baseball." I said, "Coretta, you will when I finish with you."

  So when we finished the game, she said, "Now, I want to ask you
what you know about racism in Wyoming. And how many blacks
are there in Wyoming?" I said, "Well, probably less than 1 percent.
I have a large Hispanic population of 11 to 12 percent or something
of that nature, and a native American population." Funny how you
can be from a small area and somehow be known as not sensitive
enough. I don't know what that is, but it is not real. And on the
immigration reform business, was I sensitive enough to Hispanics?
I don't know. Three million of them have come forward under that
bill, and they are now no longer living in some illegal subculture,
and that just pleases me immensely--Hispanics and Germans and
everybody else, all the way up and down the line. So it isn't just
one.

  This is a line of questioning that destroyed Robert Bork because
all he had done was be a judge on a Federal district court, just like
you, for 5V2 years, and he did 106 opinions, and 6 of his dissents
became majority opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he was
never overturned. And he was turned into a racist right here--in a
different room--also a sexist, also a violator of the bedroom, also a
sterilizer of women. That is what happened right here. I was here.
You don't have to like him or not. You don't have to get into any-
thing else. That happened.
                                      124

  So, you know, that is something we must be very careful about.
That is not a good trait for any of us to say that somehow if some-
one does not agree with our views they are somehow, you know,
racist or poll taxers or whatever or whatever. And that was uncom-
fortable. I didn't mean to drag that out, but it was all false. There
was nothing in the background of the man that proved up one bit
of it, and that is pretty tough stuff. That could happen to any of us.

  We saw John Tower, you know, with ballerinas dancing on
pianos and things that were all fake. We had to go look at the FBI
report on our colleague and found that witness T-4 said this. I said,
"Who is T-4? Some disgruntled former somebody?" And that could
happen to each one of us.

  That is what this committee, I think, should pride itself on, and
we do pride ourselves in trying to assure that we do it right. I
think we are going to do it right.

  The issue of abortion, that was a powerful, powerful response to
my friend from Ohio. Those were not only eloquent answers; the
questions were eloquent by Howard Metzenbaum. And he and I
don't always agree, but I do enjoy that ornery rascal. And he is as
spirited as I am in his causes, and I have enjoyed him in many
ways. And the thing that--I guess I could almost ask that same
question just the way he did. I really would, because it comes from
real life.

  What we are dealing with here are real live people. I went
through the abortion debate in 1975 when I was a State legislator.
It was one of the most grueling, powerful, impressive debates of the
State legislature that I had ever been involved in. From that and
from my practice, I came to the determination that a woman
should have the choice, and that I as a man and especially as a
male legislator--a spouse would be different. That would be a
whole new scenario God knows one would never want to go
through. But as a male legislator, what was I even doing in the de-
cision process, especially with, you know, a woman I remember--
since we are speaking in some rather powerful little personal re-
miniscences of the woman who sat there and said, "I have five
marvelous children, and now I know that if I am going to have the
next one and I am pregnant, I am going to lose my mind. And I am
here because you are a lawyer, and I am asking you what I should
do."

  You know, I sat for over 2Vz hours with that lady, and she even-
tually made the decision to do that. And she also said that she, as I
said, would destroy herself. She did not destroy herself. I had yet
another situation that did destroy herself in that situation. So,
really, it is so unfortunate that we get into this issue of extremism
on both sides of this issue.

  In any event, there are two or three things that I would say, and
then I do have a question. But I think you have said several times
in just this short day that all activities and decisions and the
things you have done as a judge or a lawyer, you have realized that
the most paramount feature of it is that it has some impact on an-
other life, somebody's life, some other person.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. And that is your deep feeling. You have said
that.
                                      125

  I would like to ask you a question. What else have you done in
that little community where you grew up and where you practiced
and what you did to tie you closer to the human condition? You
have talked about a hospital board. You talked about these other
things. What is it you are most proud of in the things you have
done that would disclose the man I think that the American people
are seeing here today? You have given us some. Who are you?

  Judge SOUTER. If I had to pick one thing--you have already men-
tioned it--it would be that hospital board. It was like a second oc-
cupation for me. I went on it the way lots of people went on it.
Somebody asked me to go on it. You say, well, why do you do it?
Why do you do any of those things? You do it because you are
paying your dues. You are in the group that is lucky. And the
people in the group that are lucky have got an obligation to pay it
back. And so we go on boards like that.

  Then the activities start taking sort of lives of their own. I went
on in an unassuming way. I was a quiet trustee for a couple of
years. Sooner or later, it became obvious that we were outgrowing
a building, and in kind of an innocuous way, a lawyer who was a
mentor of mine said, "Well, why don't you go on the planning com-
mittee and just make sure we don't do something foolish?" And I
said, "Well, yes, I will do that."

  By increments, by short steps, I finally found myself back in the
years when I first went on the superior court as the chairman or,
as we called it, the president of the board. And I saw all sorts of
conditions of people in doing that. We dealt with a regulatory bu-
reaucracy because we could no longer just go out and build what
we thought we needed. We dealt with a health care bureaucracy
because whatever we built was going to affect the cost of health
care throughout the State of New Hampshire. We dealt with the
fact that there were people out there who did not have health in-
surance and who might or might not be eligible for governmental
health benefits.

  Once a year, we all trotted around to the town meetings. I re-
member standing up in the town meeting of my town telling how
much money the hospital had given away in free care in that town
every year because there was a neighborhood tradition around
there that the towns would chip in to offset the costs that the hos-
pital would otherwise have to drain out of an endowment or recoup
by raising rates to the people who did pay. So we all knew exactly
what it was costing. We knew what it was costing our neighbors.
We knew what health care was costing the people who couldn't pay
for it. We knew what it was going to do to the cost of health care
throughout the State when we had to build a building. And we fin-
ished, ultimately we finished the job.

  I am glad I did that. There are many other things, I suppose,
that I might have done that would have given equal satisfaction.
The reason it gave satisfaction I think is simply that in ways I
never dreamed it would it was paying the dues. And I had a lot of
dues to pay, and I got a chance to pay them.

  Senator SIMPSON. And you paid those dues not only through that
service but through pro bono activities, some of which you have de-
scribed earlier today.
                                          126

  Judge SOUTER. I did some back in the time when I was in private
practice. Of course, I couldn't do that as a public lawyer.

   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I have just a few minutes left, and I had
a great temptation to ask about an issue. But since I have been
railing about that most of the day, I can't really do much of that,
but I will. That is the issue--here is the kind of tough stuff I would
love to get into, but I think that you can see that 1 year with one
nominee we will want to ask a lot of specific questions, and 1 year
with another nominee we won't want to ask any. And we have all
done that. I could bring out the quotes, seeing my friend from Mas-
sachusetts. But how about gun control? See there, there is one.

  There is a sign in Massachusetts on the border that says if you
have a gun in your possession it is a $100 fine. And in Wyoming
you carry a gun in the gun rack of your pickup truck. Now, that is
a pretty big difference in the United States, and that is the kind of
thing that you are going to be dealing with. And we fiercely defend
the right to keep and bear arms, and my friend from Massachu-
setts has an ever more intimate and personal reason why it is
deeper than anything any of us have ever hit on that one. Talk
about crazies with arms, versus the legitimate citizen with his
arms. So there is one for you.

  I guess I am not going to worry about you at all. I have read, and
my President appointed you, and I think you are going to be a
splendid, splendid judge. I can't wait to see you get on there with
some of those others, get into some discussion. I wish we could
record those. But the thing that is most critical and most impor-
tant and the most exciting is that you are a listener. You are a lis-
tener, and that is the key. That is the very key.

  I would have very great difficulty voting for a politician who was
not a listener or a judge, if I had the opportunity

  The CHAIRMAN. I think you would have a great difficulty finding
a politician who was a listener.

  Senator SIMPSON. That is right. Finding one would be the tough
part.

  Judge SOUTER. That is why Senator Rudman and I have always
gotten along so well. I listen. [Laughter.]

  Senator SIMPSON. We do know the propensities of your former
employer.

  Senator HATCH. We do understand that, let me tell you.
  Senator SIMPSON. Indeed we do. But that is so critical. And politi-
cians need that and judges need that, and it is so important. That
is impressive to me because there are people we deal with every
day in this place, of either party, where you are talking to them
and their eyes are just glazed over and you know they are not lis-
tening to one thing you are saying. You almost want to say, "Are
you in there? Is anybody home back there? Are you just waiting to
get out and get your suit boiled by the camera that is out in the
hall? What are you doing?"
  And so enough. But I thank you for sharing a bit of yourself and
your philosophy and your sensitivity--that is certainly not an over-
worked word and certainly a most appropriate one--and yourself.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
                                      127
  The Senator from Arizona, Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge Souter, I was not going to mention the
previous nomination hearing, but my good friend--and, indeed, he
is a distinguished scholar--from Wyoming brought the Bork hear-
ing to mind. So far, I don't think anybody sees any comparison at
all. For instance, with regard to the equal protection clause, Judge
Bork made some very strong statements about the Supreme Court's
decision banning literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. He
stated that this decision, and another which abolished poll taxes,
were very bad, indeed pernicious, constitutional rulings. I haven't
found any similar statements like those you have made. Judge
Bork's statements were written, and he admitted that he said
them. You don't have any such statements some place that we
have missed over the past 5 or 6 weeks, do you?
  Judge SOUTER. NO, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. I didn't think so. There is a great distinction
here in these hearings as far as I see, and there was no racist ap-
proach toward Judge Bork at all--at least by this Senator, and I
don't think there was by anybody on this committee. And I want
that record at least explained from this Senator's point of view.
There was a disagreement, a very strong disagreement, and that is
what this process is all about.
  Chairman Biden touched upon the interpretivist approach, you
stated in a recent interview on its relation generally as to the Con-
stitution, and you said in an interview that you are not looking for
original application, but, instead, are looking for meaning.
  Then, Senator Kennedy went on to the sex discrimination cases
in that area, and I take it that it is fair to say, from your discus-
sion with Senator Kennedy, that you have no qualms whatsoever
about the existing three standards on discrimination cases vis-a-vis
the equal protection clause that the Supreme Court has clearly laid
out as the guidelines when they take up discrimination issues. Is
that a fair assessment?
  Judge SOUTER. That is a fair assessment. The only concern that I
have expressed, and Senator Kennedy alluded to it in the course of
his questioning, is whether any of us could do a better job in trying
to articulate the middle-tier scrutiny.
  As I said, what the courts are trying to get at, whether it be the
Federal courts under the 14th amendment or the State courts
under their own equal protection guarantees, is a way of approach-
ing classifications which the law makes which is going to, in effect,
weight the State's interests or channel the question of trying to
weight the appropriate State interest to determine whether there
is a real justification for the classification in question.
  Trivial interests are not going to require tremendous overbalanc-
ing by the interests of the State. Fundamental interests do.
  What the courts are doing by coming up with a three-tier test is
in trying to give some structure to this enterprise, so that in each
case the courts at least can begin, and particularly the trial courts,
can begin by saying, all right, we know roughly what the State
counterweight must be, once we know how the particular private
interest is to be classified, and the concern, as I said a minute ago,
with the middle-tier test--and, by the way, we use it in New
Hampshire, so I have expressed this concern only in terms of the
                                      128
State Constitution in my own judicial writing--is whether we can
come up with some kind of a standard which is less subjective, be-
cause the experience has been that the middle-tier standard tends
to shade down into the first-tier standard, and if that happens,
somebody with a classification claim is going to get shortchanged.

  Senator DECONCINI. Sure, and there is no reason why it cannot
shake up to the highest scrutiny standard, either, is there

  Judge SOUTER. No, the
  Senator DECONCINI. Excuse me--particularly if the sex discrimi-
nation case is, as you say, fundamental?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, the Supreme Court's approach to that has
been--and it was described very concisely in the Court's opinion in
the Kleburn v. Living Center case--is to indicate that there were
two factors foremost in their mind in putting the sex discrimina-
tion classifications in the middle-tier category.
  One was the likelihood that a classification might really have a
legitimate reason behind it, a legitimate basis, and the case law,
the experience with the cases coming up in the Court's view has
simply been that there is greater chance that there may be a legiti-
mate basis for some sex classification, in other words that it may
not amount to invidious discrimination than would be the case in
the racial area.
  The second thing that the Court has pointed to and, as I recall,
did in the Kleburn case, is the likelihood that individuals against
whom there really has been a discrimination have some effective
political process by which to counter it, as well. And the Court, if I
understood or recall correctly, the Court's opinion, the indication
was that, in the area of sex discrimination, there was more likely
to be some political responsiveness than our history has shown in
racial discrimination, so that is why they put it in the middle.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, I know it is difficult to go back over
all your cases--and I have read a number of your cases, a couple
dozen of them during the recess--in one case State v. Dionne, you
dissented from the majority, because you believe that the State
constitution is required to be interpreted and understood strictly
"in the sense in which it was used at the time of its adoption." Do
you remember that?
  Judge SOUTER. I do remember that, yes, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. My concern there is with what I see as a
very rigid use of original intent, at least in this dissenting opinion,
and how you would apply this approach to the equal protection
clause, in light of what I think is very encouraging--maybe be-
cause I agree with it--your explanation of the equal protection
clause, particularly as it applies to race and sex and economics.
How do you apply that particular dissenting opinion?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think the first thing that has to be un-
derstood about that dissenting opinion is that, whether it was writ-
ten clearly or not, I referred to the test of--I believe I referred to
the test of original meaning or original understanding of the terms.
  I have tended to shy away from the use of the term "original
intent" in describing any approach of mine. I have done so, because
the phrase "original intent" has frequently been used to mean that
the meaning or the application of a constitutional provision should
be confined only to those specific examples that were intended to
                                      129

be the objects of its application when it was, in fact, adopted. It is a
kind of a

  Senator DECONCINI. Excuse me. Original intent, then, in what
you are telling me is not applicable to your interpretation of the
equal protection clause in the 14th amendment?

  Judge SOUTER. That is exactly right. I do not believe that the ap-
propriate criterion of constitutional meaning is this sense of specif-
ic intent, that you may never apply a provision to any subject
except the subject specifically intended by the people who adopted
it. I suppose the most spectacular example of the significance of
this is the case of Brown v. Board of Education. That case, I am
glad to say, we may safely say that that particular principle is
never going to come before the Court in any foreseeable future in
my lifetime and we can talk about it. The equal protection clause
was appropriately applied in Brown v. Board of Education.

  If you were to confine the equal protection clause only to those
subjects which its Framers and its adopters intended it to apply to,
it could not have been applied to school desegregation. I think it is
historically accepted by people of all schools that it is a historical
fact that those who proposed and those who adopted the 14th
amendment never intended to require integrated schools. The
Brown opinion itself alludes to that.

  The reason Brown was correctly decided is not because they in-
tended to apply the equal protection clause to school desegregation,
but because they did not confine the equal protection clause to
those specific or a specifically enumerated list of applications, the
equal protection clause is, by its very terms, a clause of general ap-
plication.

  What we are looking for, then, when we look for its original
meaning is the principle that was intended to be applied, and if
that principle is broad enough to apply to school desegregation, as
it clearly was, then that was an appropriate application for it and
Brown was undoubtedly correctly decided.

  Senator DECONCINI. I agree with you, Judge, and I think you
highlight the difference between this hearing and the discussion
that we have had with other nominees who have been here, some
of whom have been approved and some that have not. You deal
with the principle of the equal protection clause, and not its origi-
nal background. As you pointed out, you cannot find a justification
to apply the clause to segregated schools if you apply original
intent.

  Judge SOUTER. That is true.
  Senator DECONCINI. Let me ask you this, Judge: Justice O'Con-
nor in a case, Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, stated
that sex-based classification should be subject to the same standard
of review, regardless of whether they harm women or men. Would
you agree with that, in general, not with the Mississippi case, par-
ticularly, but
  Judge SOUTER. I can think of no reason to disagree with it.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I read that case carefully and I
was impressed with the logic and the writing of Justice O'Connor
in analyzing that and coming to that conclusion, and I am pleased
to hear your answer.
                                      130

  Justice Marshall, on the other hand, has his own distinctive ap-
proach to equal protection claims that you may be more familiar
with than I am. Marshall believes that the Court does not apply a
three-tier approach to equal protection claims, but, rather, "a spec-
trum of standing as to the review." Thus, the more important the
constitutional and societal weight given to an interest, the greater
the scrutiny that should be applied. How do you approach that
Marshall thesis?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, there is no question about the correctness of
the proposition, that the more significant the interest, the greater
societal counterweight would be required to justify an interference
or an abridgement of that interest.

  I think the question which this kind of a debate raises is whether
it is useful to identify three places on the spectrum as a convenient
basis for classification, and those who want to retain, as it were,
the whole spectrum approach I think are saying to us in so many
words, you are applying instruments that are too blunt when you
try to identify just three points and say everything has to fit into
one or the other of these three slots.

  I will confess that I have not come to the point, even though I
have worried sometimes about whether we were articulating the
middle-tier test as well as could be done, and maybe we are, but
even though I have worried about that sometimes, I have not
gotten to the point of saying we ought to scrap the whole notion of
three tiers and just take, in effect, every issue as an original bal-
ancing issue in the first instance.

  Senator DECONCINI. But do you agree that the intermediate or
middle test is not satisfactory for all of those cases that come
before that seem to fall into that area, that you need to look at
that middle tier more carefully and more on a case-by-case basis, to
see whether or not that is really applying the equal protection
clause in the manner of the history of that clause and its interpre-
tation?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I am certainly satisfied that it would be too
blunt a set of instruments, just to have one test at the bottom and
one test, if you will, at the top.

  Senator DECONCINI. I get a feeling from the little bit I have read
of Justice Marshall that he has the same quandary you do about
that intermediate or middle test, that he is concerned that it falls
down, instead of falling up.

  Let me turn to another subject, Judge. Over the last few terms of
the Supreme Court, almost 50 percent of the Supreme Court cases
have involved issues of statutory interpretation. Your judicial expe-
rience has been in a State court, so you have not had much expo-
sure to cases of Federal statutory interpretation, and that is why I
would like to ask a few questions.

  I did notice in the committee's questionnaire, you stated,

  The foundation of judicial responsibility in statutory interpretation is respect for
the enacted text and for the legislative purpose that may explain a text that is un-
clear.

  Based on that response to what extent do you believe the legisla-
tive history should be taken into consideration, if you were sitting
                                      131

on the Supreme Court interpreting a statute passed by the Con-
gress?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I am very much aware, in answering or
in approaching an answer to that question, about the great spec-
trum of evidence that gets grouped under the umbrella of legisla-
tive history. It seems to me that the one general rule--and it is a
truism to state it, but the one general rule that I can state is, when
we look to legislative history in cases where the text is unclear, we
at least have got to look to reliable legislative history.

  When we are looking to legislative history on an issue of statuto-
ry construction, what we are doing is gathering evidence, and the
object of gathering evidence for statutory interpretation is ulti-
mately not in any way different from the object of gathering evi-
dence of extraneous fact in a courtroom.

  We are trying to establish some kind of standard of reliability, in
this case to know exactly what was intended. And what we want to
know is, to the extent we can find it out, is whether, aside from the
terms of the statute itself, there really is a reliable guide to an in-
stitutional intent, not just a spectrum of subjective intent. I sup-
pose a vague statute can get voted on by five different Senators for
five different reasons, so that if we are going to look to pure subjec-
tivity, we are going to be in trouble.

  What we are looking for is an intent which can be attributed to
the institution itself, and, therefore, what we are looking for is
some index of intended meaning, perhaps signaled by adoption or
by, at the very least, an informed acquiescence that we can genu-
inely point to and say this represents not merely the statement of
one committee member or committee staffer or one person on the
floor, but in fact to an institution or to a sufficiently large enough
number of the members of that institution, so that we can say they
probably really do stand as surrogates for all those who voted for
it.

  Senator DECONCINI. SO, in looking at legislative history, I take it
from that, the amount, the intensity of it, those that are associated
with the subject matter are of importance in a judge's interpreta-
tion?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, indeed.
  Senator DECONCINI. More so than if it can be distinguished that
someone merely put something in the record, because it appeared
that it was the right place to put it in, but had no history in that
legislation themselves.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. What other sources should a judge rely on in
a statutory construction case outside the statutes and legislative
history?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, there is a kind of, I suppose, broad principle
of coherence that we look to. The fact is we so frequently speak of
interpreting sections of statutes. What we are really obligated to is
to interpret whole statutes. We should not be interpreting a statu-
tory section, without looking at the entire statute that we are in-
terpreting.
  One of the things that I have found--and I do not know particu-
larly why I learned it, but I found one thing on the New Hamp-
shire Supreme Court which has stood me in pretty good stead, and
                                      132

that is when I get a statutory interpretation issue in front of me, I
read the brief, I listen to the argument. But if I am going to write
that opinion, I sit down, I tell my law clerks to sit down, but I do it
myself before I am done, and I just sit there and I read the whole
statute. Fortunately, I do not have to construe the Internal Reve-
nue Code, in which case I would be in serious trouble with that
methodology. But within reason, I try to read the whole statute,
and I am amazed at the number of times when I do that, I will find
a clear clue in some other section that nobody has bothered to cite
to me in a brief.

  We are trying to come up with statutory coherence, not with just
a bunch of pinpoints in individual sections. So, the first thing to do,
in a very practical way, is to read the whole statute.

  It is beyond the intent of your question, of course, to get into con-
stitutional issues, but we do know it is accepted statutory interpre-
tation that if we have a choice between two possible meanings, one
of which raises a serious constitutional issue and one of which does
not, it is responsible to take the latter, and, of course, we looked at
that.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, the term, textualism, has been used
to describe a judge who attempts to limit the statutory interpreta-
tion to the text and ignores the legislative history. You explained
what you do, and such an approach really fails to take into consid-
eration, I think, the necessity--although I have never been a judge,
I have certainly had a lot of association and argued enough cases
where I have felt at least the judges have listened to legislative his-
tory propounded on both sides of it, maybe not always coming to
the same conclusion.

  The fact that the matter is passed by a legislative body--often,
those of us in those bodies are not clear ourselves as to the absolute
interpretation or how it is going to be applied by the regulators or
the bureaucracy that must implement our statutes.

  I think it is very important that you have laid out a record here.
I am curious about your views as a judge who might disregard dis-
positive legislative history and create his own definitions. If that is
a judge's final decision, would you consider that judicial activism,
to ignore this discussion that we have just had?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I was going to say activism is a term that
we all employ to describe the activities of any judge when we do
not approve of the activities. And so given that definition of activ-
ism

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me interrupt you a minute. I do not
quite agree with that definition because

  Judge SOUTER. YOU are probably a more principled man than I
am.

  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Sometimes a judge will come to
a conclusion that might very well be activism, and I can think of a
few cases that I have argued before that I was very glad that he
was an activist judge, even though I profess against that, but go
ahead.

  Judge SOUTER. I think probably a fair bedrock of activism is at
least--or example of bedrock activism is ignoring any clear and
positive source, objective source of law. I think what you are de-
                                          133

scribing in your example is a refusal to accept an objective source
of meaning.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge, because I think that
helps me a great deal as to how I feel you will approach the consti-
tutional questions, and certainly the statutory questions.

  I want to say, Judge, you have said many impressive things
today; many of them have left a very favorable impression with
me. Most important to me is that you are very convincing, that you
are a listener; nothing is more important in communication than to
listen. That, to me, leaves me with a very good feeling about the
nominee that is before us today.

  Senator Thurmond touched a little bit on the principle of respect
for precedents, and although I do not think he said stare decisis,
but along that line, how does a judge treat a 5-to-4 decision differ-
ently from a 9-to-0 decision when he is asked to perhaps consider
not following stare decisis? Have you thought about that, having
sat on the State supreme court?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think that is one of those questions
that you cannot answer in the abstract like that. If we are talking
about a 5-to-4 decision that is 50 years old and has spawned a body
of consistent, supporting precedent which is basically the founda-
tion of the law that we have, the fact that it was 5 to 4 originally is
a matter of small or no consequence at all.

   If, on the other hand, we are talking about a 5-to-4 decision
which was rendered the year before and in between there are argu-
ably inconsistent precedents with it, then, of course, you are not
going to be able to give it that much weight. I suppose the real sig-
nificance of its being 5 to 4 under those circumstances is that if it
were unanimous it is virtually unlikely that there would be the ar-
guably inconsistent precedents following it.

   So I just think the numbers analysis standing by itself is a mis-
leading analysis.

   Senator DECONCINI. SO you would not put any more weight in a
5-to-4 decision to a 9-to-0 decision, as far as the application? Each
case has to stand on its own in the history of that case?

  Judge SOUTER. I would be wary of any abstract numerical princi-
ple like that.

   Senator DECONCINI. What about public opinion in a judicial deci-
sion? Does that play any role in a judge's objective decision?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, it better not play any role in the
application of principle. We all know of decisions--there could not
be a better one than Brown.

   Senator DECONCINI. I agree with that. How does a judge--how do
you, Judge, attempt to avoid that influence from the real world
that you live in, as we all do--public opinion on a subject matter;
that is, the abortion issue or some other issue where the polls dem-
onstrate popular support another way? How do you attempt to
mentally prevent yourself from being influenced?

  Judge SOUTER. By being conscious, Senator, of the fact that you
could be influenced. It is a problem like any other problem; you
solve it by facing it. You face the fact that you are human and that
you are subject to being pushed unless you guard against it, and
you face that as a possibility. You keep it in your consciousness.
And by doing that, I think you can come as close as a human being
                                      134
can possibly do to eliminating that from a role in the decision
which you otherwise might not even be aware it was playing.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, let me ask you one last question for
today. I am gravely concerned about the so-called litigation explo-
sion and its effect on the working of our judicial system. In the
past 25 years, the volume of court cases has increased dramatically
at all levels, State and Federal courts. There were 15,000 filings in
the district courts of the U.S. Federal courts in 1915; 45,000 in
1950; 120,000 filings in 1975; today there are over 275,000 filings a
year.

  There are 575 district judges to handle 275,000 filings; 168 circuit
judges handling 33,000 filings, and 9 Supreme Court Justices han-
dling over 5,000 filings.

  The number of pending product liability cases alone has in-
creased 257 percent in 8 years. Part of the reason perhaps is that
this country has 750,000 lawyers. I am concerned, Judge Souter,
and maybe you can just give us your ideas of it. I realize you do not
control the Judicial Conference. That is the Chief Justice's statuto-
ry area, but nevertheless, you have had a long experience. You
have seen this growth. You witnessed it. I am sure you have been
under the pressure of it. What role do you see, or how do you see
any changes? Do you have any, quite frankly, observations about
it?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I have not--as you know, I have not
been a part of the Federal judiciary long enough to have any quali-
fication to give a judgment about the problems of the federal
system. I have virtually just arrived as a circuit judge when I sud-
denly find myself here.

  But I know that I have gotten used to thinking about that prob-
lem in the State context from which I came. I never wrote a defini-
tive analysis of it, but I think I have some appreciation of the com-
plexity of it.

  We tend, it is true, as lawyers and judges to be willing to stab
ourselves to a degree, at least when we are really being candid,
with some responsibility for the problem. We say, well, there are
all of those lawyers out there bringing the cases, and the judges
may say, well, there are all of those judges recognizing new causes
of action that did not exist 10 and 20 and 50 years ago.

  I am wary of putting very much weight to those explanations.
There are, of course, instances in which liability has been expand-
ed. Products liability has obviously grown as a preferred cause of
action.

  But what we overlook are two other things that have happened
in the last 25 or 50 years. The first is, at least in my own State, we
have got an enormously larger population. The litigation explosion
in New Hampshire is, to a very significant degree, in civil matters,
of course, a function of population.

  One thing the State of New Hampshire, I know, has not done or
tried to do seriously until recently is to try to keep up with that
population explosion. The fact is the population has grown far
more exponentially than rights of action have grown during that
period.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU do not think that we should be attempt-
ing to find new avenues to address the problem, or we should just
                                      135
keep up with more courts, more prisons if it is the criminal matter,
and more courts to handle the civil cases?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I think what you allude to with re-
spect to civil litigation is what might be called the good news of the
litigation explosion, and that is that it is forcing not just the judici-
ary, it is forcing society to ask seriously in a way that it did not do
20 years ago, whether there is now a new significant class of cases
which belong not just in regulatory agencies to get them out of the
courts, but belong outside the adversary process entirely.

  I mean, the good news is that alternate dispute resolution has
become a respectable subject of concern. It is a subject of experi-
mentation in my own State, and I would assume in every State in
the Union.

  Senator DECONCINI. DO you subscribe to it?
  Judge SOUTER. I certainly do.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Thank you, Judge Souter, very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, the second to the last question the Sena-
tor asked about impact of public opinion--and you said you said
you had to guard against it--I would respectfully suggest that you
guard more closely against it when it comes from Rudman and less
closely when it comes from Rath, McAulliffe, and Broderick.
  Judge SOUTER. I will take that under advisement, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate your patience today, Judge.
  We will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
  [Whereupon, at 6:08 p.m., the committee adjourned, to reconvene
at 9:30 a.m., Friday, September 14, 1990.]
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO BE AS-

  SOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

  OF THE UNITED STATES

                        FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1990

                                                                       U.S. SENATE,

                                                  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.

  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:33 a.m., in room 216,
Senate Hart Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman
of the committee) presiding.

  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Spec-
ter, and Humphrey.

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Good morning, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. We are going to begin our second round of ques-
tioning today. Judge, as you have probably discerned by now, we
are a lovable bunch of people up here. All those stories that Duber-
stein told you about us are not true.
  Judge SOUTER. I will claim the privilege on that, Senator. [Laugh-
ter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Our first questioner today will be the Senator
from Iowa, Senator Grassley.
  Before he begins, let me just warn the witness and all my col-
leagues. There is an important cloture vote at 10:15. If that vote is,
in fact, going to be on time--and we are going to check about 10
after to make sure it is about to be called--rather than have a Sen-
ator start his questioning, if we are at that point, we will recess at
that point, be prepared to vote, go vote, and come back immediate-
ly. That is how we will proceed unless the time begins to slide on
that 10:15 vote. We don't want to be in the middle of a dialog and
have to be interrupted.
  Now, Senator Grassley. Thank you for your indulgence, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to tell you,
first of all, that I reworked my questions through the evening so
that I don't think they will provoke any demonstrations from the
audience. [Laughter.]
  Senator GRASSLEY. Good morning, Judge Souter.
  Judge SOUTER. Good morning, Senator.

                                                        (137)
                                         138

   Senator GRASSLEY. The morning papers, of course, are trying to
confirm how well you did yesterday.

  Judge SOUTER. They make me very nervous.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, if there is any one thing that a politi-
cian in this town respects, if not, in fact, envies, it is very good
press. So you have passed a very important test.
   I also congratulate you again on your nomination, and I also
want to thank you for the time that on two different occasions you
spent with me in my office, allowing me to get to know you better.
Under our system of government, our face-to-face meeting these
few days is likely to be the last time any of us will be able to ask
you questions. And so I hope that we can continue our dialog; not
to seek commitment from you on specific cases but, rather, to more
fully understand your approach to deciding these cases. And at the
same time, Judge Souter--and I say this hopefully--our conversa-
tion will not only tell us more about your judicial method but will
also educate the public on the role of a judge in our democratic so-
ciety. So let me start with some general questions on that role.
  Judge Souter, some who have spoken highly of you--and most
people have spoken very highly of you--term you "a lawyer's
lawyer," someone entirely devoted to the law and to the profession.
This phrase was often used to describe Justice Cardozo, who served,
as you know, on the Supreme Court in the 1930's, after a long
tenure on New York's highest court.
  I would like to read to you a passage from one of Cardozo's most
famous lectures on the nature of the judicial process. And, I would
like to get your reaction to that. I quote:

  The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at
pleasure. He is not a knight errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of
beauty or of goodness. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and un-
regulated benevolence. Instead, he is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition,
methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to the primordial
necessity of order in social life. Wide enough in all conscience is the field of discre-
tion that remains.

  I think I understand what Judge Cardozo said in this lecture. So
my question to you is: What do you think that he meant?

    TESTIMONY OF HON. DAVID H. SOUTER, TO BE ASSOCIATE
    JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Judge SOUTER. I think he was referring, although most obviously
to the nature of the appellate process, I think he was referring to
the constraints upon the legal process which applied to it in any
level, whether it be trial or appellate.

  What the judicial process gives in return for the respect and the
acceptance that it deserves is an assurance of objectivity, to the
extent that it is humanly possible. We confront that assurance the
first moment we go into a trial court. We are immediately con-
strained. We immediately constrain ourselves in the search for
facts to make that a search for truth. The reason we have rules of
evidence in trial courts is to try to bring a discipline of objectivity
to what we do and what we ask the other components of the judi-
cial system to do in arriving at a result which can be called just.

  When judges function at the appellate level, if they are following
the ideals of Cardozo, they are also subjecting themselves to those
                                         139

kinds of constraints. There is no area, certainly, in which that con-
straint is any more focused and any more difficult to keep in per-
spective than when we are dealing with what have been called the
majestic generalities of the Constitution, when we are searching for
meaning which is not spelled out in easy black-letter phrases, when
we are trying to construe statutes and constitutions which are not
written with the detail of the Internal Revenue Code.

  What we are trying to do to avoid that roving quality, that
knight errancy that Justice Cardozo--or Judge Cardozo then--was
speaking about, is to try to find an objective source of meaning
which constrains us, as well as the rest of the republic, which was
intended by the people who drafted and the people who adopted
the constitutions and the statutes that we are dealing with, be-
cause it is only if we try to search for a source of meaning outside
ourselves and our preferences or the preferences that may be fleet-
ing at the moment do we really deserve, as members of a judicial
system, the respect and the acceptance which ultimately is the
foundation for the rule of law in this republic or in any republic.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, a recent nominee to the Su-
preme Court once said--and I think what this nominee said is fully
consistent with the Cardozo passage that I just quoted and you re-
sponded to--and I give you this quote: "In a constitutional democ-
racy, the moral content of law must be that of a framer or legisla-
tor, never that of the morality of the judge."

  Do you share that philosophy of judging?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. I share the demand that we look outside our-
selves, the demand that we guard against simply imposing our
views of morality or public policy, however passionately we may
hold them and however profound our principle may be. We have
not been placed upon courts, in effect, to impose our will. We have
been placed upon courts to impose the will that lies behind the
meaning of those who framed and by their adoption intended to
impose the law and the constitutional law of this country upon us
all.

  Senator GRASSLEY. SO when it comes to the judge's own values
and beliefs, there is little or no room for those in his constitutional
interpretation?

  Judge SOUTER. He has got to guard constantly against substitut-
ing his values for the values which he is sworn to uphold.

  Senator GRASSLEY. If I could, I would like to discuss with you the
issue of rights created by the courts. We have had heard a great
deal of discussion, not only yesterday but in the past, about unenu-
merated rights and how they manifest themselves, whether it be a
right to unlimited abortion, undefined rights of privacy, or other
rights not spelled out in the Constitution. And where these other
rights lead to, of course, is anyone's guess. This past January is an
example. A Federal judge went so far as to find a constitutional
right to panhandle in the New York City subway. Of course, from
my point of view, thankfully the second circuit overruled him.

  Let me ask you, do you have any concern about Federal judges--
and Federal judges are fallible human beings like everyone--creat-
ing such new rights? And I don't refer specifically to that right to
panhandle. I don't refer specifically to those other rights that I lim-
                                          140

ited in this immediate statement, just generally creating such new
rights out of whole cloth.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, perhaps the only amendment I would like to
make to the way you asked the question is I wouldn't single out
the Federal judges. The Federal judges are confronted with a prob-
lem that confronts all judges. I have spent the last 7 years of my
life as an appellate judge in the state system, so I know what I
speak of from the State standpoint. That is going back to perhaps
my earliest exchange yesterday with the chairman of this commit-
tee in which we began the discussion about one particular unenu-
merated right which is enforceable through the due process clause.

  As I indicated to him, I think that a fair reading of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, like a fair reading of the constitution of
my own State, compels the conclusion that there were values, in
the case of our discussion a value of privacy, which were intended
to be protected even though they were not spelled out in black-
letter detail. And the difficulty that the judges have facing that
fact--if, indeed, like me they accept it as a fact--is the difficulty of
finding a discipline process for giving content to what we call the
unenumerated--or the category of unenumerated rights.

  This has been a source of great difficulty over the years. I think
at one point yesterday in our discussion I mentioned my view that
the incorporation doctrine is not the answer to the problem of how
we keep from roving aimlessly in this quest. It seems clear to me
that the concept of liberty is not limited by the specific subjects
which the incorporation doctrine by bringing, as it were, the entire
corpus of the stated Bill of Rights into the concept of the liberty
clause. Liberty is not so limited.

  Facing this problem, judges have tried formulations, at least to
give labels, if nothing else, to the enterprise that they are engaged
in when they are searching for meaning and trying to put reasona-
ble limits upon their search. One of those formulations was that
the content of the liberty clause certainly includes whatever would
be comprehended by the concept of ordered liberty without which
liberty and justice would be impossible.

  I think perhaps I have preferred an approach which I indicated
without a lot of discussion yesterday to the chairman, and that was
the approach which is often identified--not exclusively but identi-
fied with Justice Harlan. Justice Harlan not only sometimes in-
voked the concept of ordered liberty, as, in fact, I think he did in
Griswold. But he asked us to make a search somewhat further
afield than that, but quite specifically to the subject of the Ameri-
can tradition, and search for evidence of that understanding of
what might be called a bedrock concept of liberty, which is ex-
plained and indicated and illustrated by the history and traditions
of the American people in dealing with the subject of liberty.

  I think my best approach to the problem of how to keep from a
totally undisciplined and totally nonobjective approach to the
search for meaning is very much like what Justice Harlan de-
scribed. But this is a difficulty which the judges simply cannot
avoid. If they accept the view that I espouse that a search for
meaning and for content of the notion of liberty is necessary, then
they have got to face this problem. And if they face it in the way
that I do, they have got to look for some kind of objective limita-
                                         141

tions that will guarantee that they don't fall into merely personal
expressions of preference.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, in a sense, we as Americans
have many more rights than ever, yet, by and large, the American
people feel politically powerless. I sense a paradox when I read Su-
preme Court decisions like Missouri v. Jenkins from last year,
where the Court permitted a Federal judge to order the Govern-
ment to increase property taxes to pay the cost of a court order. I
think it is fair to say that under our constitutional system, citizens
simply can't understand that a court could assume for itself the
taxing powers always thought to be reserved to elected representa-
tives in their legislature.

  This is, in my view, a profoundly antidemocratic decision decided
by a bare 5-to-4 majority. Of course, I am not going to ask you to
comment on whether you thought this case was correctly decided,
but I would like to ask you if you understand my point that when
we depend on unelected and unaccountable judges for our rights,
we are relying on something fundamentally antidemocratic.

  Judge SOUTER. I think there is no question that one of the anima-
tions in the judicial quest for self-restraint is exactly the consider-
ation that you have described.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, Abraham Lincoln warned about
government by the judiciary in his first inaugural address. He said
this, and I quote: "If the policy of the government upon vital ques-
tions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by deci-
sions of the Supreme Court, the instance they are made in ordinary
litigation the people will have ceased to be their own rulers."

   Do you share President Lincoln's fear of government by the judi-
ciary, that sort of irrevocably fixed decisions?

  Judge SOUTER. I certainly share the spirit in which President
Lincoln made that remark. I think that what we have to recognize
in assessing the significance of Lincoln's statement for today is
some of the history that has passed in the time between when the
President made that address and the time when we are living now.

   The most obvious and significant fact of history for our purposes
is the adoption of the 14th amendment. The President was not con-
templating the 14th amendment at the time that he made that
statement, and he was not contemplating--he could not possibly
have been contemplating the increase in national power in relation
to the power of the States, which it was the object of the 14th
amendment to effect. And that was in an increase in national
power not only on the part of the judiciary but, of course, on the
part of the Congress, too, as was indicated in some of our discussion
yesterday about the significance of congressional enforcement
power under section 5 of the 14th amendment. But it is undeniable
that the very fact that standards for scrutinizing State action were
enacted by the 14th amendment, and made subject to judicial over-
view is undeniable; that the Federal judiciary and, in fact, the
State judiciary acting pursuant to the 14th amendment, assumed a
power which President Lincoln could not possibly have envisioned
at that time.

   We not only have to accept President Lincoln's admonition; we
also have to accept the responsibilities that the 14th amendment
have inevitably placed upon us.
                                      142
   Senator GRASSLEY. It seems to me whether it is 1861 or 1990,
though, the principle laid down by the President that if there is
bad Supreme Court precedent--and as he used the terms, irrevoca-
bly fixed--that under our principle you can't accept bad law as a
permanent fixture.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, as you know, Senator, without any lecture
from me, the constitutional precedent is always, in theory, subject
to reexamination. Our theory of precedent tries to give some indi-
cation of the force which a given precedent should have when reex-
amination is requested.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, those who advocate a greater
activist role for the Court say that the broad and spacious terms of
the Constitution lend themselves to Court-made solutions when the
political branches fail to act.
  What is your sense of this perception that the courts, rather
than the elected branches, should take the lead in creating a more
just society?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the proper way to approach that is that
courts must accept their own responsibility for making a just socie-
ty. One of the things that is almost a factor or a law of nature, as
well as a law of constitutional growth, is that if there is, in fact, a
profound social problem if the Constitution speaks to that, and if
the other branches of the Government do not deal with it, ulti-
mately, it does and must land before the bench of the judiciary.
  One of the interesting developments--and I would suggest to you
without trying to indicate to you in any way the direction that I
think it should go--one of the hopeful developments or the develop-
ments that give me hope is the fact that we are living at a point of
history right now where there is so much concern expressed in this
committee yesterday and expressed in comment throughout the
legal and political community in the legitimate extent of congres-
sional power to act under the fifth section of the 14th amendment.
  Because if, in fact, the Congress will face the responsibility that
goes with its 14th amendment power, then by definition, there is,
to that extent, not going to be a kind of vacuum of responsibility
created, in which the courts are going to be forced to take on prob-
lems which sometimes, in the first instance, might better be ad-
dressed by the political branches of the Government.
  I guess the law of nature I am referring to is simply the law of
nature and political responsibility, constitutional responsibility,
abhor a vacuum. I have spoken to this point before and I think I
alluded to it yesterday.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Are you saying the Supreme Court should act
because there is a vacuum there, or because there is a cause within
the Constitution for the courts to act; as opposed to because the po-
litical branches have not acted?
  Judge SOUTER. The Supreme Court should only act and can only
act when it has the judicial responsibility under the 14th amend-
ment or any other section of the Constitution. But the Supreme
Court is left to act alone when the political branches do not act be-
forehand.
  We had Brown v. Board of Education as a decision of the Su-
preme Court, because we had no decision from any other branch of
                                          143

the Government, at any other level of the Government, facing the
undoubted constitutional problem that had to be solved.

  It seems to me that one of the changes we are seeing in the com-
plex of power in this country right now is a greater willingness of
the Congress of the United States to look to its authority under the
14th amendment, and for that matter, under article I, so that the
Court is not left in the position of seeming to be the only guarantor
of some of the very liberties that we must most be concerned with.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, yesterday, you mentioned the
ninth amendment. I understand the historical context of the ninth
amendment to view it as, I suppose, somewhat of a savings or re-
serve clause to foreclose application to the Bill of Rights the maxim
that the affirmation of particular rights implies a negative of those
not expressly defined.

  But at this point, I have a problem. There is a kind of "rights'
industry" out there that we read about and we deal with all the
time in the Congress and maybe the courts deal with it more than
we deal with it. We have various groups making their essentially
political claims in terms of so-called fundamental rights--whether
it is people claiming an unrestricted right to taxpayer's financed
abortion or an artist claiming an unconditional right to taxpayer
subsidized art, or the right to, as I said before, panhandle in the
New York City subways.

  You are an avid reader of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Is this situa-
tion I just described perhaps what he meant when he warned that
"all rights tend to declare themselves absolute to their logical ex-
treme?"

  Judge SOUTER. I think what he was getting at there, yes, I think
what he was getting at is if we simply focused on one interest and
the desirability of that interest alone, there is a tendency to self-
development that is simply unchecked. That is why, as I said a
moment ago, it is important, in my view, to approach the problem
much as Justice Harlan did.

  But in any event, whether by the Harlan approach or by any
other, it is essential for us--as judges, who have got to declare in
some objective way the extent of the interest that can be recog-
nized--it is essential for us to have some idea of the criterion that
we are going to employ to find values which are not simply reflec-
tions of our own feelings at the moment and our own feelings
about the desirability of the claims that may be pressed before us.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, when unaccountable judges
rather than legislators create these rights, I would like to ask you
if you could imagine how that could lead to polarization, resent-
ment, and even bitterness among the public?

  Judge SOUTER. I think the key to the response to that, Senator, is
in one of the terms that you used, when an unelected judiciary cre-
ates these rights. There is a sense in which the judiciary, I suppose,
particularly at the State level and dealing with common law issues,
do create rights. They are dealing in areas which, by definition, the
legislature has left to the courts to develop.

  But when we reach the level that I think you are talking, and I
know that you are referring to this morning, it is essential to ob-
serve the distinctions between the creation of rights, which implies
that the Court is simply sitting there and coming up with notions
                                      144

of what it thinks may be desirable, and the recognition, on the
other hand, of rights which are implicit in the text of the Constitu-
tion, itself, in which it is the responsibility of the judiciary to find
and to state in ways that we can understand. The difference be-
tween the creation of rights and the recognition of rights is the dif-
ference between unbridled personal preference, that knight erran-
cy that Cardozo was speaking of, and a disciplined approach to con-
stitutional meaning, on the other hand.

  I think when the people who are, like us, subject to the decisions
that ultimately appellate courts must make, have a sense that the
courts are conscientiously engaged in a search for meaning, that
their task is to decide what should be recognized and not what is
created, that that will make and can make all the difference in the
acceptance which is given to the decisions when they come down,
even if they are not the most popular.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me suggest that over the years Congress
has objected probably far too little over this encroachment, mostly
out of our own self-interest. After all, if we or any legislature just
sit back and consciously let the courts make the tough policy deci-
sions, of course, we can tell our constituents, blame the courts,
don't blame us.

  But, in my opinion, we are paying a heavy price for this sort of
silent conspiracy. Having given you my opinion, let me ask you--
and this will probably be my last question, because we are out of
time--in your personal opinion, is the tendency to increasingly
turn every tough issue into an issue for the courts a healthy devel-
opment of our constitutional democracy?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, it is not a healthy development for a couple
of reasons. The first is that some of the issues that seem most in-
tractable may well yield to political solutions and the kind of politi-
cal judgments which--and I use politics with kind of a large "P", I
guess there--that after all, it is the genius of the democratic
system to entrust to elected representatives.

  In the longer run, there is an even more disturbing tendency,
and that is to the extent that there tends to be a vacuum of re-
sponse to problems that have to be solved and to the extent that, of
necessity, those problems ultimately end up before the judiciary
and without having had some solution proposed by the political
branch of the Government, or branches of the Government, there
is a tendency, I think, on the part of all of us, and on the part of
the people of this republic who elect, who appoint and who watch
what is going on, to assume that the only guardians of the Consti-
tution are the judges.

  The judges have a particular pivotal responsibility in guarding
the Constitution, but it is absolutely essential to remember that
the judges are not the only people in our governmental structure
who are sworn to uphold the Constitution and to try to make it
work.

  The Executive, the President of the United States, takes such an
oath. All of you take such an oath. And you are, just as all of you
in the political branches, are just as much responsible for making
good on the Constitution's guarantees as we are in the judiciary.
                                         145

  For the people of this Nation to forget that that is your responsi-
bility, as well as the responsibility of people in my branch, is a
very disturbing prospect to me.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I appreciate the time that you have
spent with me on this round. I guess in closing, I would just simply
say that I see litigation as a very poor way of--because it is so
blunt and cumbersome process that it is, and so adversarial, and
not a very good instrument for social change. The consensus and
compromise that can come through the people's branch, the legisla-
tive bodies of our society, is the proper place for that to be done. I
just do not see the courts as a very good place to do that, and I
hope that judges see that as well, not avoiding their responsibil-
ities, but seeing themselves in terms of a coequal branch and with
a very limited role.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I am done.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Let me say to our witness and to the committee, in 4 minutes we
have to vote on cloture. Our staff has checked and that is still
scheduled for 10:15.
  My recommendation would be, rather than start with Senator
Leahy, and then be interrupted four or 5 minutes into the question-
ing, that we recess now. I will vote and ask Senator Leahy to vote
immediately when we get over there and come right back so that
with a little bit of luck, by between 20 and 25 after, Senator Leahy
and I, at least, will be back to reconvene the hearing.
  Until then, we will recess.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  We have 3 hours' worth of questioning on the first round if ev-
eryone takes a half hour. We will make a judgment after we get
through four, whether we will break for lunch at that point or go
on and finish the first round and then go to lunch.
  We will not be going late this afternoon. I have spoken with the
witness' people, they understand it, I do not think they disagree
with that at all, and so I think this afternoon we will probably not
be going much beyond 4 o'clock, the latest 5 o'clock, just so every-
one can plan their schedules accordingly, unless for some reason it
was possible to finish everything, and I do not see any realistic pos-
sibility of that today, Judge, but things are flowing along smoothly.
I hope you think that, as well, and we will just keep moving on.
  With that, let me yield to my colleague from Vermont, Senator
Leahy, for his round of questioning.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreci-
ate your courtesy in recessing for the vote, so as not to interrupt
these questions.
  Judge, welcome back.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. We have gotten word now from the chairman
that the New England people can get back home this weekend.
  Judge, I was struck very much yesterday when you spoke of your
close friendship with Senator Rudman and Mr. Rath. I did not
know Mr. Rath before these hearings. I consider it one of my privi-
leges in serving the Senate also to be a friend of Warren Rudman.
                                      146

We have traveled back and forth to Vermont and New Hampshire,
depending upon where the plane stopped first. With his clout, it
usually stopped first in New Hampshire.

   The CHAIRMAN. Since deregulation, does it stop in either State?
   Senator LEAHY. Yes. [Laughter.]
   He, however, had to stamp my visa while I was there and ap-
plauded me for being one of the few U.S. Senators to land in New
Hampshire and not declare immediately for the Presidency.
[Laughter.]
   Because of my friendship with Warren, I was struck by your re-
action to his experience as a young man when he faced discrimina-
tion because of his Jewish background, and Mr. Rath's encounter
with discrimination because of his Irish background. It was a
touching comment.
  If you and the committee would bear with me for a moment, I'll
tell you why: My grandfather, who was also named Patrick Leahy,
was a stonecutter in Barre, VT, who died when my father was only
12 or 13 years old. My father was the only male in the family and,
at 12 or 13 years old, he had to go out and start looking for work
which he did and worked all his life.
  When he was that age, the signs in Montpelier, VT, and Barre,
VT, were either "No Irish Need Apply," if they were genteel about
it or if they were more direct, "No Catholic Need Apply."
  I also know in my mother's family--her Italian parents emigrat-
ed to this country--faced some of the same things. Now, I like to
think that in Vermont, in New Hampshire, throughout New Eng-
land, those vestiges are gone and long gone. I believe they are, and
I think those of us who have heard the stories know how painful it
would be for those days to return. I remember the pain in my own
father's voice as he told me about these stories.
  I have no question in my mind of your own feelings on this issue.
I do not believe--from anything you have ever said here or in the
past--that there is a discriminatory bone in your body, and I think
you feel, as Senator Rudman does, as I do, and as everybody on this
committee does, that discrimination based on religion or race or
anything else is abhorrent. The scar of discrimination occurred in
our country and still occurs in some places, but it is something any
of us of conscience, especially in government, should do everything
to eradicate.
  I would like to explore with you one particular area where such
discrimination has to be hedged against and where the Constitu-
tion explicitly tries to avoid it. That is in the first amendment, in
the establishment clause.
  In March 1978, back when you were attorney general of New
Hampshire, then Governor Thomson issued a proclamation order-
ing that the flag over the State capitol and flags on other State
buildings be flown at half-mast on Good Friday to commemorate
the death of Jesus Christ. The proclamation said, among other
things, if I could just read from it a little bit:

  Whereas in lands where the Christian religion prevails, and among churches
throughout our land Good Friday represents a day of solemn prayer. We appreciate
the moral grandeur and strength of Christianity as the bulwark against the forces
of destructive ideologies, and I hereby appeal to my fellow citizens to reverently ob-
serve Good Friday. Flags flown at half-mast on our buildings will memorialize the
                                              147

death of Christ on the cross, and I urge our fellow citizens to fly their own flags at
half-mast and their lapel flags in a position of distress on Good Friday.

  Now, in my family, in my upbringing, we always observed Good
Friday, and many others do, but I question whether that should be
raised to this level of State action. So, let me go into your own
views of the establishment clause.

  The Supreme Court has addressed this issue many times. We had
the Abington School District v. Schemp case back in 1963, an 8-to-l
decision, in which the Supreme Court struck down statutes that
provided for reading of verses from the Bible or the Lord's Prayer
to begin each school day, and the Court said the State must remain
neutral among the various religions and between religion and non-
religion. It spoke of the wholesome neutrality the State has to
maintain toward religion. It said that government action neither
advances nor inhibits religion, taking the words of the Supreme
Court in that case.

  My question is this: Do you agree that government has the obli-
gation, under the first amendment, to remain neutral toward reli-
gion?

  Judge SOUTER. I accept that as a personal principle. I recognize
that it is a principle which is subject to much ferment at the
moment, in trying to delimit its contours. I recognize that there is
a school of thought which has received articulation within the
present Supreme Court that the establishment clause was restrict-
ed to a more limited purpose, that it was restricted to the purpose
of avoiding the literal establishment of a State religion, and was
restricted to avoiding the expression of preference as between sects,
which I guess in an historical context would, of course, be Christian
sects or denominations.

  Whether, in fact, that school of thought is going to be pressed, as
it were, as a claim for adoption, for a rethinking of the theory of
the establishment clause, I do not know. I think we can reasonably
anticipate that it will, and I think that particular position is prob-
ably going to be pressed before the Court. And I think the only
thing that I could say to you with respect to that or with respect to
someone who is pressing that issue before the Court is that, if I am
there on any issue, I will listen respectfully to it.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, I appreciate that and I would hope that
all Justices would listen to the parties' arguments and consider
them carefully. But you spoke of your accepting it as a personal
principle in your answer. Do you accept it as a legal principle?

  Judge SOUTER. I certainly accept it as the prevailing law of the
United States, as it has been, for practical purposes, during my
professional legal lifetime, and I do not have at this time either an
agenda or a personal desire to bring about a reexamination of that
position.

  The great difficulty that has come, as you know, in establish-
ment clause cases has come from the difficulty of applying the
three-part Lemon v. Kurtzman test, and the concerns that have
been raised about that, naturally, provoke a search not only per-
haps for a different test of the standard which we think we are ap-
plying today, but a deeper reexamination about the very concept
behind the establishment clause.
                                      148
  But if I were to go to the Court, I would not go to the Court with
a personal agenda to foster that, and neither would I go in igno-
rance of the difficulty which has arisen in the administration of
Kurtzman.
  The only thing I was going to add is, in the oft-noted conclusion
that we can find circumstances in which there seems to be an oppo-
sition between the theory of the establishment clause and the
theory of the free exercise clause, and we have to recognize that as
a problem for the Court to deal with.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU mentioned Kurtzman a couple of times.
Kurtzman, like Abington, said the controlling test for determining
whether government action violated the separation of church and
state was the secular purpose and effect test.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Kurtzman was also the controlling law or con-
trolling test at the time you were attorney general, is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, the Governor issued the proclamation, you
did not. I assume that you were not involved in the drafting of the
proclamation, is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. I was not involved in the drafting of the procla-
mation that was litigated in that case. One of the facts which I
think may not appear of record, I frankly do not remember wheth-
er it does or not, is that following the original proclamation which
led to the action that you refer to, the Governor revised the procla-
mation and he revised it to give it, to articulate a much more secu-
lar purpose to what he was doing than the first proclamation could
perhaps have been read to indicate.
  When the litigation arose in that case, the position taken by the
U.S. district court was that the second proclamation, what I will
call the more secular proclamation of which I was aware, could not
be considered in determining the validity of the Governor's action,
without his making a formal withdrawal of the first proclamation
by essentially the same formalities or with the same degree of pub-
licity with which he had issued the first one. So, as a result, the
second comparatively secular proclamation was never a pointed
issue in the district court's order.
  I go into this, only because--although I do not remember the spe-
cifics of anything that was in that second proclamation. I remem-
ber well enough that there was discussion with the Governor about
the fact that he was going to issue one and I probably saw the lan-
guage of it before he issued it, although I do not specifically re-
member that.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, let me ask you this: To the extent that
there was a revision, it was because the district court ordered it, is
that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. My recollection is that the revision took place
after the district court action had been brought, but before the dis-
trict court order was issued, because, as I recall the district court
order, it included a determination that the district court should not
take the second proclamation into consideration, unless the first
had been withdrawn with the same formalities with which it had
been issued.
                                         149

  Senator LEAHY. Without having to spend time here trying to
figure out which came first and which came second, it should be
fairly easy to doublecheck, and I am not asking you to remember
everything that happened. This dispute moved on a fairly fast
basis, as I recall in reading it, over a matter of hours and days. But
we can, and I am sure you do, remember very well the basic ele-
ments.

  Now, to get your views today, I ask the question: The proclama-
tion had references to the Christian religion, reverently observing
Good Friday and flag lowering. How could those be considered sec-
ular, in light of Abington and Kurtzman?

  Judge SOUTER. Let me, if I may, divide my answer to that ques-
tion in two, Senator.

  Senator LEAHY. GO ahead, but then I may end up repeating the
question.

  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say, you may revise it back, but let
me start, if I may, with this: I think I have to respond to two differ-
ent senses of that question. The first is how could I, as counsel for
the State of New Hampshire, take a position in defense; second,
how would I, if I were a judge with the identical issue before me
today, tend to view it? And if I may, I would like to respond to you
with those two distinctions in mind.

  As to the first question, my responsibility as counsel there was
my responsibility as counsel in any case in which I was represent-
ing the State, speaking through the Governor, and that is was
there a position which could be advanced on behalf of the position
that he had taken, consistently with the law as it existed or as it
might reasonably be argued that it ought to be, which was not a
frivolous or wholly unreasonable position.

  I believe there was and took such a position. Essentially, the ar-
guments which the lawyers in my office made were that although
there were, of course, references to Jesus Christ as a religious
figure. The tenor of the proclamation was to call into mind a set of
moral principles which transcended the Christian religion.

  The reasonableness or the ethical appropriateness of taking this
position I think is indicated by the responses which the various
courts made to the action. In fact, the U.S. district court, through
Judge Skinner from Boston, held against the State on that issue.

  The two extraordinary points which I think should be noted, in
response to your question, is, first: The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit, to which the State took an immediate appeal, in
fact, I forget the precise order, but it either reversed or stayed the
district court's order, and the reason, as I recall, that it did so was
that the first circuit thought the issue was such a serious issue, not
a simple and clear-cut thing, that the plaintiffs, in fact, had come
into court with dilatory hands, and that an issue of that impor-
tance should not be decided under the gun, because it was not an
easy issue to decide.

  And what most concerned the court of appeals, as I recall, was
the fact that the Governor had done exactly the same thing on
Good Friday a year before. There had been plenty of time to liti-
gate the constitutionality of what the Governor had done, and the
plaintiffs, who were aware of what had happened the year before
and likely to happen again, had not done so.

         39-454--91 6
                                      150
  So, I took and take today the position of the court of appeals as a
vindication of the one point which is most significant for my role,
and that is did I have a reasonable position to advocate in that
case.
  What is also interesting is that, although on what perhaps was
the fastest appellate action I ever knew of in practice, although the
U.S. Supreme Court later reversed the court of appeals, with the
effect of reinstating the district court order, the U.S. Supreme
Court did so on the basis of 5 to 4, so there was real division in the
U.S. Supreme Court as to whether the court of appeals had acted
properly on the basis of finding that there really was a serious
issue here, and this was not some clear-cut constitutional violation.
  Senator LEAHY. But it was eventually found that the proclama-
tion and lowering the flag went beyond, or did not meet the secular
purpose and effect test, is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, that is what Judge Skinner had found, and
at the point at which the Supreme Court reversed the court of ap-
peals and reinstated Judge Skinner's order, it was really too late to
do anything about issuing new proclamations, and the case just pe-
tered out at that point.
  Senator LEAHY. Using this as an example, do you believe that the
lowering of the flag met the secular purpose and effect test, do you
believe so today, looking back at it?
  Judge SOUTER. If I were sitting as a judge today, I would prob-
ably have ruled, given that proclamation, the same way that Judge
Skinner ruled.
  Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask and what draws me into this is
that you made reference to the fact that, as counsel for the Gover-
nor, you were upholding his position. Now, I am sure Governor
Thomson had all kinds of advisers on this, and I recollect the
source of some of it and some of his ideas were interesting, to say
the least.
  Judge SOUTER. They certainly were to me at the time.
  Senator LEAHY. Yes, well, I am sure he could keep a whole office
going with some of them. But one of the reasons I bring this up,
Judge, is that I was struck very much by your last answer to Sena-
tor Grassley.
  All of us take an oath of office. Obviously, Senator Grassley and
I and every other Senator is upholding the advice and consent role
of the Constitution just in having this hearing.
  When I was a prosecuting attorney, every time I brought a
charge, I brought it on my oath of office. My oath of office was
written on the information. You had an oath of office to uphold the
Constitution as attorney general.
  At what point does that oath make you say to the Governor
"This is not a constitutional action"?
  Judge SOUTER. The point at which it is clear that it is an uncon-
stitutional action and that there is nothing that can be reasonably
brought before the Court for adjudication.
  There is a great difference between the kinds of judgments which
an attorney general must make when he is asked for an opinion as
to what, in his judgment, is the most appropriate and most likely
constitutional action, on the one hand; and when he is asked to ful-
                                      151
fill his role as State's counsel when the elected representatives of
the people have taken a different position.

  The Governor was, in fact, elected by the people of New Hamp-
shire and he had a role in setting State policy which was undeni-
able. If his view of what was constitutional differed from mine, but
was subject to a fair argument in its favor, whether I would have
ultimately made the same decision or not, I believe that I had an
obligation to represent that position.

  I think what is most important to me about that is that it is an
obligation not simply because as an attorney general I was hired
on as a lawyer. Part of the attorney general s and part, indeed, of
any lawyer's obligation to defend the Constitution is to engage in
good faith and with the utmost vigor in the process by which we
hope will be sound constitutional adjudication comes about.

  We will not have sound constitutional adjudication in this coun-
try if we do not have a sound and vigorous adversary system.
Whether or not in any given case, I might agree personally that
my client's judgment was the best judgment, whether I might
agree with the ultimate conclusion as to whether it was right or
wrong, my own personal belief is that, as a lawyer, I will do my
best fairly and honestly as an advocate.

  We have a constitutional system in this country in which we are
going to get the right result. I took that position as attorney gener-
al, and I have taken that position when, in fact, in an indirect way
I was being sued myself. There was a case recently that was
brought before the U.S. Supreme Court about the residence re-
quirement for membership in the New Hampshire bar. That was a
requirement that was set long before I was on the court, although I
had not taken any step to change it and I thought there was a rea-
sonable basis for it.

  But I can remember--after the argument was made in that case,
before the Supreme Court, in which the constitutionality of a rule
of my own court was in issue--I said to the lawyer who had argued
the case against us that I didn't know how it was going to come
out. I thought there was, in fact, good reason in the court's discipli-
nary responsibilities to require some kind of a residence require-
ment.

  But, in point of fact, the only thing I was really worried about in
the long run was whether the issue had been vigorously presented
to the Supreme Court. I said to him that I knew counsel represent-
ing us had done so and that I knew that he had done so, and I
wasn't going to worry about the result.

  That same attitude that we have a valid process which is going
to get us through if everyone in that process does the best possible,
I think, should be part of the constitutional animation of an attor-
ney general.

  Senator LEAHY. In general principle, I agree with you and I sus-
pect that everybody does. But there are also certain responsibilities
that attorneys general, or prosecuting attorneys have because of
the unique power they have and the oath of office they follow.

  I can think of a number of times when I declined prosecution be-
cause I questioned whether the methods used to gather evidence
were constitutional or because of other issues--that, again, were
based on my oath of office.
                                      152
  So, let me ask you about one other case--I know time is growing
short on this--again, because of the issue you raised in my mind,
in your answer to Senator Grassley.
  As attorney general you handled a case, Maynard v. Wooley,
which went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. That is the
case in which a couple who were Jehovah's Witnesses had moral
and religious objections to the State license plate "Live Free or
Die" motto and they blocked it out.
  They felt so strongly that they ended up being prosecuted three
times. I believe Mr. Maynard served a couple of weeks in jail--15
days in jail, in fact
  Judge SOUTER. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY [continuing]. Rather than compromising his be-
liefs. Now, when they challenged the State law under which they
were being prosecuted, you opposed the Jehovah's Witnesses.
  The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice
Burger in favor of the Jehovah's Witnesses, held that the first
amendment prohibited New Hampshire from requiring these
people to put the State motto on their license plate.
  In fact, the Chief Justice said, "The first amendment protects the
right of individuals to hold a point of view different from the ma-
jority and to refuse to foster, in the way New Hampshire com-
mands, an idea they find morally objectionable."
  But in your brief, you dismiss the actions of the Jehovah's Wit-
nesses as "bizarre behavior" and as "pure whimsy," even though
they had been willing to go to jail for their beliefs.
  So my question is: Without relitigating that particular case, what
is your view of Chief Justice Burger's statement about the first
amendment as protector of the rights of minorities, even very
small minorities, who hold views different than the majority?
  Judge SOUTER. There is no question about its correctness. There
was no question about its correctness at the time of Maynard v.
Wooley. The first amendment would be worthless if that were not
true.
  The issue--and I don't want to go into any more detail than you
do, Senator--the issue in Maynard v. Wooley was whether requir-
ing the display of a license plate with that motto was, in effect, re-
quiring the person driving the car to appear to adopt or to affirm
the truth or the soundness of the statement on the motto.
  I did not, in fact, believe that it was reasonable to construe a li-
cense plate requirement in that way. In fact, the New Hampshire
Supreme Court had already ruled on exactly that issue, and it held
that it was not, for first amendment purposes, that kind of an affir-
mation that would be violative of the first amendment.
  The issue in Maynard v. Wooley essentially came down to an
issue of interpreting fact. The Supreme Court of the United States,
although not unanimously, disagreed. My best recollection is that I
think it was Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist who hap-
pened to dissent in that case.
  Senator LEAHY. I recollect it as being an 8-to-l decision.
  Judge SOUTER. Was it 8 to 1? I may be wrong on that. In any
event, the Supreme Court of the United States had already ruled--
not against the Maynards, it was in another case--but they had al-
ready ruled on exactly that issue.
                                      153
  So that I was not left simply to make a judgment on my own
about what would be an appropriate case to defend, because that
issue, in effect, had already been foreclosed to me by the New
Hampshire Supreme Court ruling.
  So we might disagree about the application of the principle in
that case, but the soundness of the principle is beyond dispute and
it was beyond dispute then.
  Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask this, of course, is thinking back
to wearing your judge's hat, for example, would you regard the in-
terests of the State in putting its motto on license plates to be so
compelling that it would justify prosecuting people who had reli-
gious objections to the motto?
  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry?
  Senator LEAHY. Whatever the motto might be. I don't mean to
pick on New Hampshire. New Hampshire has a motto, Vermont
has a motto, and most other States do as well. I am not singling
out a particular motto, but the basic principle, is the interest of the
State in putting a motto on a license plate so compelling that it
should be allowed to prosecute people who have strong religious ob-
jections to the motto?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, of course, as I think as you suggest the need
to identify a motto on the plate, as opposed to identifying numbers
and letters by which the car can be identified is, of course, not a
particularly compelling interest, and it was not so regarded by the
Court at the time.
  Senator LEAHY. They were not trying to block the numbers on
the plate?
  Judge SOUTER. That is right, no, they just wanted that motto out.
  Senator LEAHY. OK.
  Judge, I am told that my time is virtually up, and I am going to
want to go back to this later on. I am not, as none of us is, asking
you to prejudge cases that might come up, but you know the estab-
lishment clause in the past few years has been reviewed again. I
hold the very strong feeling that one of the greatest bedrocks of
our democracy is in the first amendment and the right of free
speech, the right to practice any religion we want or not to practice
any religion because those two things almost guarantee diversity.
And if you get diversity, untrammeled diversity, you have, by defi-
nition, a democracy that is going to work.
  Judge SOUTER. I think you have.
  Senator LEAHY. SO I will go back into that, and I appreciate your
answers.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Senator.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, let me give you a very brief roadmap of where I
would like to go in my alloted 30 minutes. I want to pursue the
freedom of religion subject for about one-third of that time, pick up
the War Powers Resolution, and then discuss some of your testimo-
ny for Senator Grassley on what I would like to analyze as the dif-
ferences between the original meaning from your Dionne opinion
versus the Court filling the vacuum.
                                      154
  The beginning of the Bill of Rights refers to freedom of religion.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
  I have two questions, and in the interest of time, let me put them
both to you at the start. The establishment clause, and this goes to
general approach, was defined by Justice Black in Everson, "In the
words of Jefferson, in the clause against establishment of religion
by law, was intended to erect a wall of separation between church
and state."
  And the words, "a wall of separation between church and state"
were Jefferson's words. There is a sharp distinction which Chief
Justice Rehnquist makes in Wallace v. Jaffre where he says, refer-
ring to the separation between church and state, the wall of sepa-
ration, Chief Justice Rehnquist says, "it should be frankly, and ex-
plicitly abandoned".
  I believe in terms of a general approach on the establishment
clause trying to get a general philosophy that is as good a starting
place as any and that is the first question on the first amendment.
  The second question goes to the free exercise clause and the opin-
ion of the Court in Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith where
Justice O'Connor is very direct in strong criticism, saying that the
majority opinion dramatically departs from well-settled first
amendment jurisprudence, unnecessarily resolves the question pre-
sented, and is "incompatible with our Nation's fundamental com-
mitment to individual religious liberty". She says that because of
the essence which she cites a few pages later, that there is the fail-
ure to require the Government to justify any substantial burden on
religiously motivated conduct by a compelling State interest and by
means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
  My second question to you is, Do you agree with Justice O'Con-
nor that when you impede on the exercise of religion that there
ought to be those two factors, a compelling State interest and
means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest?
  Judge SOUTER. Let me start with your first question on the estab-
lishment clause and the appropriateness of preserving Justice
Black's adoption and the Court's adoption of the Jeffersonian view
of a wall of separation.
  The difficulty, I think, that is focused by the Court today comes
to the fore because of the difficulty in applying the--as I men-
tioned a moment ago--the Lemon v. Kurtzman test. But for that
difficulty, there is some question in my mind as to whether there
would be the present ferment to rethink the very conceptual foun-
dation of the establishment clause, which, as you indicated a
moment ago, Chief Justice Rehnquist has been doing in some of his
own opinions.
  I think, like a lot of people approaching the establishment
clause, I am loath to talk about scrapping Lemon v. Kurtzman,
without knowing what comes next. With respect to Chief Justice
Rehnquist's position, I have never done personal research on the
issue of the original meaning on the establishment clause, as I said
a moment ago to someone else.
  I would receive evidence on the issue respectfully, if there were
reason to present it before me, but it is not something upon which
I can pass a judgment at this point.
                                      155
  What I think I can helpfully say is the difficulty which I think
those who do, indeed, adopt the Jeffersonian view, must face on the
Lemon v. Kurtzman test. In fact, it is a difficulty which has ulti-
mately nothing to do with the final conceptual rethinking that
may go on, on establishment, if, indeed, it does go on.
  As you know, Lemon v. Kurtzman has sometimes seemingly been
honored in the breech. In the first Kresh case, as I recall, the
author of the Lemon v. Kurtzman opinion said, well, that is a gen-
eral approach that we have to this issue, but it is not the exclusive
approach that we have to it.
  The discomfort--I suppose there are many reasons that have
been expressed for the discomfort with Lemon v. Kurtzman--but I
will tell you what my discomfort is. It is a discomfort which relates
to the relationship between Lemon v. Kurtzman as an establish-
ment clause test, and the so-called Shurbert test which has, in a
series of cases, as you know, prior to the Smith case this year, been
used as the test for free exercise.
  The concern is this, that in the free exercise cases--and I think I
would like to take the Amish school case as my favorite example--
in the free exercise cases, individuals are claiming that a generally
applicable State law unduly burdens their exercise of religion.
  Once it is determined that, in fact, their position is a genuinely
religious position and that there is, as a matter of fact, a burden
placed upon it by a generally applicable State law, the Court has
traditionally, since the time of the Shurbert case, applied a stand-
ard, as you say, of very strict scrutiny.
  There must be a compelling State interest to justify that burden,
and the law that does so must be narrowly tailored to have that
effect alone. It was on that reasoning that, in the Amish school
case, Wise v. Yoder the Amish parents were allowed an exemption,
in effect, from the requirement that they send their children to
school until they are 16 years old.
  The great difficulty that arises is that, when we ask the question,
what would have happened in the Amish school case, if, instead of
coming to the Court as a free exercise case, it had come to the
Court with a slightly different statute as an establishment clause
case, what if there had been a statute in effect which provided that
there would be an exception expressly for Amish parents, from the
State law? The immediate problem that would have been encoun-
tered under Lemon, is that the purpose of that law, the first of the
Lemon tests would have been a religious purpose.
  The speculation is just inevitable that the Amish school case
could have gone the other way.
  Therefore, my concern is, since I have not personally had any
reasons to raise questions about the appropriateness of the strict
scrutiny test, and have no reasons to raise questions about the ap-
propriateness of the strict scrutiny test for free exercise cases, have
we not got to take Lemon to some degree of refinement which has
not yet been articulated to avoid what has explicitly been recog-
nized as the potential conflict between the two tests in which
  Senator LEAHY. Judge Souter, I don't want to interrupt you
unduly, but I don't think that the broad analysis or treatise is re-
quired consistent with Kurtzman, to make an answer to a funda-
mental question about whether you agree with the Jeffersonian
                                      156
principle articulated by Black and held by the Court for a long
time about the "wall of separation".

  Nor do I think that the interrelationship, and it is a very com-
plex issue, is necessary to come down to the basic concern about
whether you are going to have a compelling State interest and
narrow tailoring.

  I think those are two very threshold questions. I would press you
for specific answers because I think those are within the range of
general philosophy appropriate for this kind of an exchange.

  Judge SOUTER. As I started to say and apparently got sidetracked
on saying, I have had and have today no reason personally, in
either research or philosophy, to want to reexamine the view which
was expressed in Everson. But my concern is that that view has
been identified with a Lemon v. Kurtzman test. And we have to
face the fact that in the implementation of that view, there is a
difficulty which sooner or later the Court has to resolve.

  Senator SPECTER. I will take that as a qualified yes. How about
the free exercise question?

  Judge SOUTER. On the free exercise question, I have to be circum-
spect to a point because I believe that the Smith case is subject to a
motion for rehearing presently before the Court. And without any
question, I think the development of that issue is something that if
I were confirmed would come before me. But I think there are
some things that with a reasonable degree of specificity I can say.

  The first is that I do not come here and prior to the decision of
that case or after it I have not had personal reason to want to reex-
amine the strict scrutiny test which has been applied in a lot of
cases since Shurbert. I recognize the reasoning of the majority opin-
ion. I mean I can follow it; I understand what the Court was saying
in the Smith case. But I also recognize I think the fact that that
case could also have been examined under the Shurbert standard.
And as you mentioned or indicated a moment ago, that, of course,
is exactly what Justice O'Connor did in her concurring opinion in
that case.

  I do not know at this point whether we should take the Smith
opinion, if it stands, as being a total rejection of Shurbert. The one
thing I do know is that the way the opinion was written, Shurbert
seems to have been reduced to a rule for unemployment compensa-
tion cases. And I can tell you that I did not so read it, and I did not
so read its application to, let's say, the Yoder case, the Amish
school case, as resting upon the kind of analysis which the Court
indicated would be its only justification for applying it there.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I hope the Smith case doesn't go that far,
and I hope that your predisposition to side with Justice O'Connor
comes to fruition if you are confirmed, because the basic require-
ment requiring a compelling State interest and a narrowly tailored
means to achieve that interest seems to me very fundamental in
the exercise clause, just as I personally believe that the standards
of Jefferson and Black on the wall, however you articulate it, keep-
ing that as a basic philosophy, to be very important.

  Judge SOUTER. May I just add one thing, Senator? That is, I
would not want you or anyone else to take what I said this morn-
ing as a commitment if I were on the Court to join with Justice
O'Connor if this matter were brought before me. What I do want
                                         157

you to understand is that I approach the issue, or would approach
the issue, if it came before me, with exactly the view of the value
of the strict scrutiny test which I described to you.

  Senator SPECTER. I accept that, Judge Souter. I do not believe
that it is appropriate to ask you for commitments.

  Judge SOUTER. I understand that.
  Senator SPECTER. The extent is to get a general approach.
  Let me shift at this point to the issue of the War Powers Act.
The War Powers Act was enacted in 1973 because of concern about
the involvement of the United States in the Korean war without a
declaration of war and in the Vietnam war without a declaration
of war. It was passed over the President's veto. It has been a bone
of contention as to whether it is constitutional or not, whether the
President has powers as Commander in Chief which make the War
Powers Act unconstitutional, or whether, in fact, the President has
exceeded his constitutional authority in what has happened in
Korea and Vietnam, because Congress has the sole power to de-
clare war. This is a matter of enormous current importance.
Saddam Hussein even crowded David Souter off the front pages for
a time.

  Judge SOUTER. I had no objection to his doing that, I assure you.
  Senator SPECTER. Glad to see you are back on the front page,
Judge. However contentious this may be, this is a lot better arena
for contentiousness than Saudi Arabia.
  But there is a real issue now which is starting to percolate as to
the President's authority to project U.S. forces into hostilities, and
the President has taken the position that certain notification has
been given to Congress, not a recognition of constitutionality, but it
is a sort of a hedge.
  On this subject, I start with the question whether you believe it
was constitutional for the United States to engage in a war, the
Korean war, without a declaration of war by Congress as called for
in the Constitution.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I think the only answer that can
be given to that is that that is an issue which was never focused by
the action of the United States and the Korean war because the
issue was one essentially of congressional versus executive power,
and that issue was never raised. The Congress of the United States,
in fact, did fund the Korean war. The fact is that there was never a
declaration, as you know, with the international law consequences
that would follow from it. But the issue of constitutionality, as I
understand it, is essentially an issue of congressional versus execu-
tive power in this area, and that issue was never raised.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Souter, if you are suggesting that
to have a case in controversy or standing there has to be action
taken by the Congress not to fund a military action, I would say
that that might carry the matter too far; that Congress is not
really in a position to stop funding when the U.S. military forces
are on a front line or the planes are in flight; that there has to be
some resolution beyond. And in a minute, I want to come to the
question of standing and some of the litigation; 110 Members of the
House of Representatives in one case took the matter to court in
Lowry v. Reagan. But I think that the Korean war is sufficiently in
the historical past that that issue is not likely to come before the
                                      158
Court, and ask a flat question whether you think it was constitu-
tional to fight that war without a declaration of war.

  Judge SOUTER. I think that question, Senator, basically is a ques-
tion about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act, is it not?

  Senator SPECTER. NO, I don't think so.
  Judge SOUTER. My concern is that I don't think
  Senator SPECTER. NO, I don't think so at all. There wasn't a War
Powers Act. There wasn't an issue of withdrawing troops in 60
days. This is history. We all know the history. And I don't think
there are any War Powers Act implications in it at all. Here you
have a war which was fought and wasn't declared by Congress, and
the issue is did the President have the powers as Commander in
Chief, not an issue which is so impinging on any matter to come
before the Court that I think a statement on that is well within the
permissible ambit.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, the reason that I was concerned to
suggest that I think that raises the issue of the War Powers Act is
not because there was any such resolution on the books at the time
of the Korean war, but because the War Powers Resolution which
is on the books today basically articulates a congressional position.
And the congressional position would today be the focus for asking
that question.
  I think two things are necessary for me to say. The first is, of
course--and I know you recognize this--that because of the reason-
able likelihood that the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolu-
tion could come before the Court in some guise, I cannot give an
opinion on the constitutionality of that.
  Senator SPECTER. I agree with that and do not ask that question.
  Judge SOUTER. And I think the most that I can say with respect
to looking beyond that specific issue is that it is recognized, though
it is not a matter of litigation at this point, that the President as
Commander in Chief is not limited in the commitment of the U.S.
troops to a formal declaration of war. In fact, the War Powers Res-
olution itself recognizes that the President is obligated to take
action and must have the power to take action.
  Therefore, it seems to me that the commitment of the United
States troops in Korea in the first instance certainly could not be
regarded, leaving aside the aegis of the United Nations, could not
be regarded as itself an unconstitutional act. The only issue which
it seems to me can be focused upon is: Is there an articulable way
of limiting the President's authority as Commander in Chief which
would focus this issue? And the only articulated attempt to do so
that I am aware of has been the War Powers Resolution. I think,
therefore, the only thing that I can properly say to you is we
know--and it would, indeed, be my opinion--that the President is
not certainly forbidden to commit United States troops without a
prior declaration of war. How far he may go, in fact, I think can
only be regarded today as a War Powers Resolution question.
  I will, in any event, be candid to say that I could not sit here
today, even if we had no War Powers Resolution, and articulate to
you a limitation on how far the President could go with or without
the express approval of Congress.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I would ask you, Judge Souter, to rethink
your refusal to answer the question as to the Korean war. I would
                                      159
ask you to rethink it in terms of the proposition that it is a part of
history, that the War Powers Resolution was not in effect at that
time, that the President took certain action, and there was follow-
up action. The circumstances are so far in the history that it may
have some relevance--but it certainly wouldn't be conclusive--on
what would happen if the War Powers Resolution came before the
Court at the present time.

  Judge SOUTER. May I just add one thing, Senator?
  Senator SPECTER. Sure.
  Judge SOUTER. It seems to me that in approaching that kind of
question, we really have to approach it in much the same way that
we would approach a foreign relations question. One of the things
that I think is standard analysis in the approach to questions of
that sort is that when the President, in fact, is acting under the
auspices of the foreign relations power and when he is, in fact,
acting also with some expressed authorization by Congress, the
issue of authority is probably an issue which does not arise or
which is not focused.
  And I do think that in approaching the Korean war question, we
have to face the fact that it was undoubtedly within the power to
commit troops to some degree and some instance without congres-
sional approval; that, in fact, congressional support was expressed
throughout that period by congressional appropriation and by the
authorization which Congress thereby expressed. And it is difficult
for me to see--although I will rethink this when I have some time
to be quiet, it is difficult for me to see how the combination of the
President's power with that degree of approval and support from
Congress could raise a genuine issue of unconstitutionality that
would be subject to adjudication.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you start talking about foreign re-
lations, that injects another element of complexity into a subject
which is already complex enough.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. When you talk about appropriations, it isn't re-
alistic for the Congress to stop appropriations at a time when a
war is being fought. And if you follow through the logic of your last
answer, that there is some implicit sanction--I left out Vietnam
particularly because of the Gulf of Tonkin issue. I wanted to focus
exclusively on Korea as a more distant event at any rate. But if
you take that kind of implicit approval, then we have read out of
the Constitution the congressional authority to declare war. The
President does have authority to make a commitment to some
extent, and once he makes that commitment, if the Congress has
the options of not funding, as a way of litigating, it is no option at
all.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think the only thing I could say to that is
you make the assumption that Congress never has a funding
option. Not being a Member of Congress, I can't second-guess you
on that, but that is a position--it never has an option once the
troops are committed and engaged. That is an assumption that I
would be loath to make.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, we won't speculate about you becoming a
Member of Congress.
  Judge SOUTER. There is no chance of it.
                                          160

   Senator SPECTER. But I don't think we have that option, if I can
answer one question.

  Let me turn in the 5 minutes remaining, 4% that I have, to the
question of original meaning and expansiveness of constitutional
interpretation, and your testimony both yesterday on equal protec-
tion, and your testimony given to Senator Grassley's excellent
questioning this morning, where you testified in very broad and ex-
pansive terms about the Court's role in filling a congressional
vacuum. If the Court is going to fill congressional vacuums, the
Court is going to do a lot of filling because there is a lot of congres-
sional vacuum around.

  You interpret the liberty clause very, very broadly as a starting
point with the incorporation doctrine, taking into the due process
clause of the 14th amendment the Bill of Rights, and then both
yesterday and today you have expressly stated that that is just a
starting point, which is very, very broad, indeed.

  I have some concern about the scope of those answers when I
take a look at the cases which you have decided. There are some--
one, in particular Richardson, concerning a liberty interest. But
the bulk of the cases I think is more accurately characterized by
Dionne. There is a case where you had in issue a fee schedule
where the majority said that the payment for the judges "smacks
of the purchase of justice"; that "the spectacle of the citizen return-
ing giving cash in one hand and calling for a judicial hearing and
decision in the other is one that can no longer be tolerated"; and
saying that "it is inconsistent with the professional judiciary," and
then referring specifically to the contemporary culture--rather, "a
contemporary injustice."

  Then in your dissent, you start off with the proposition that you
agree with the Court's disapproval of the fee system, and then pro-
ceed to look for original meaning by going to an unreported case
from 1663 and statutes from 1781 and 1768 and 1878. And as I look
at that opinion in the context of your description of Brown v.
Board of Education, there was a situation where, if you look for
original meaning, the District of Columbia schools were segregated,
even the Senate gallery was segregated. Raul Berger in his analysis
of the contemporary thinking was that the equal protection clause
did not even give the right to vote or the right to desegregation.

  It seems to me that the thrust of what you have had to say in a
solitary dissent--the other four justices of New Hampshire were on
the other side in the stated Dionne case--is very much at variance
with the broad expansive answers you have given to Senator Grass-
ley today and that you gave yesterday on the equal protection
clause.

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, you can pack a lot into one question.
  Senator SPECTER. I wish I had more time. I would ask it more
simply.
  Judge SOUTER. Let me start first with an issue of adjectives be-
cause I think it is an important issue. You have characterized my
testimony about the recognizable liberty interest as taking a very
broad position, and you have spoken of my reference to incorpora-
tion as just a starting point. I want to go back to them for a
moment just by way of preface.
                                      161

  What I said in response to the question about incorporation was
that I did not believe that the definition of the concept of liberty,
which was subject to recognition and protection in the 14th and the
5th amendments, could be limited by the incorporation doctrine.
Indeed, if it could be limited by the incorporation doctrine, there
would be no question as to whether some core right of privacy was
cognizable under those two amendments.

  With respect to how much further the so-called liberty concepts
in those amendments should be treated as recognizing rights en-
forceable against the Government, I have not given an opinion. I
have given an opinion that there is certainly a core concept of pri-
vacy which is to be recognized and that certainly aspects of marital
privacy, which we discussed yesterday, are among them.

  How much further, how much broader the concept to privacy
and, hence, ultimately how much broader the enforcement power
under the liberty clause may be is something which is going to
have to be developed by the courts over the course of probably a
great many years.

  Going next to what you question is the inconsistency between my
position in Dionne and my espousal of the correctness of the Brown
decision, let me start by saying that, as you recognize, the interpre-
tive position that I start with when I am looking at a provision
which has not been construed is one of original meaning, and in
discussion yesterday I distinguished that from the theory that
would confine that meaning to those applications which were origi-
nally and specifically intended by the framers or by the adopters of
that provision to be its application.

  I have read Raul Berger's book, and I think--although people
will dispute about his constitutional interpretive views--I think his
history is well accepted by most people today.

  There certainly was no intent whatsoever in the enactment of
the 14th amendment to bring about school desegregation. And if in
fact the meaning or the guarantee of equal protection were con-
fined to specific intent, then of course, Brown, instead of being a
correct decision, would have been a wrong decision. But my inter-
pretive position is not one that original intent is controlling, but
that original meaning is controlling.

  In construing the 14th amendment, the first fact that has to be
faced is that the best index, the point at which you start the quest
for meaning, is with the text. And as I said yesterday, the text of
the 14th amendment is a very broad text. It is not in fact, as we
well know by its terms, limited to race, although race was obvious-
ly the problem most on their minds. It was not limited as the 15th
was by reference to prior condition of servitude. And therefore
whatever troubles some people may have with the 14th amend-
ment, I think the point at which we have to start in the process of
construing the scope of the equal protection clause has got to take
into account that it was not written in such a way as to be restrict-
ed either to race or to the specific racial applications intended or
on the minds of the people when it was adopted.

  And given that as a starting place, as I said, I think there is no
question that Brown was correctly decided and the provision cor-
rectly construed.
                                          162

   Now, is that inconsistent with my view on Dionne? It is not. Just
as I said a moment ago, the text is the starting place from which
we have to construe the 14th amendment; the text was the starting
place from which we had to construe the provision of the New
Hampshire Constitution that justice should be available freely and
that right or justice should not be purchased.

   The question is how much freedom, if you will, from cost was
that provision intended to embody. If we read that provision in a
totally, literally, expansive sense, we could have said, well, certain-
ly there can be no filing fee for someone who wants to come into
court in a civil case. In a sense, there is nothing free if you have to
pay $50 to file your case. And we could have gone on through a
number of incidents of expense that are accepted in the system and
have always been accepted in the system as being costs that could
reasonably be levied.

  The question before the court was, then, how free did they intend
it to be; what kinds of costs were they trying to outlaw? And that,
in the context of that particular issue, came down to basically a
choice between two principles--the principle against paying any-
thing beyond a filing fee to get into court, on the one hand, saying
that anything beyond that would be a violation of the provision;
and the other principle, which was the one that I thought was sup-
ported by evidence of the original meaning of the framers, that
what was trying to be outlawed by that provision was essentially,
in a word, bribery. I think the provision was traced back to the
kind of fines which the medieval courts dealt with and which were
still in people's minds at the time of the adoption, whereby money
payments could be made to the courts either to delay a case or to
bring about its resolution at the convenience and with the result
intended by a given litigant.

  And therefore the issue in the Dionne case was simply a narrow-
er issue than the issue in Brown v. Board. The meaning came down
to a closer choice between two possibilities. But the ultimate crite-
rion of meaning for me in the Dionne case was exactly what I
think the ultimate criterion should have been and was for the Su-
preme Court of the United States in Brown--not specific intent,
but the principle intended. And of course, those distinctions will
grow narrower and narrower the more narrow and exact the lan-
guage it is that we are construing, but the ultimate criterion re-
mains the same.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Souter. We'll
come back to that when I have some more time.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Our next questioner will be Judge Heflin, Senator Heflin, from
Alabama.
  Senator HEFTJN. Following up on Senator Specter's question on
the Dionne case, was the equal protection clause of the Constitu-
tion invoked in that issue?
  Judge SOUTER. In the Dionne case, sir?
  Senator HEFLIN. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. NO, it was not. The only issue that was raised
there was the provision precluding the purchase--or, the require-
ment that justice be purchased.
                                      163
  Senator HEFLIN. Does your supreme court have a rule, as do
some, that in civil cases the court will not address issues unless
they were raised in arguments or briefs?
  Judge SOUTER. We do have such a rule. I think the only times
that we ever depart from them are times in which it would be so
misleading to decide a case based on an issue which on our exami-
nation we later realized was there and cannot be avoided, that we
might be forced to refer to it, although even there the preferred
practice, of course, is to call for a reargument so that that can be
expressly addressed.
  Senator HEFLIN. I have a little problem in the Dionne case. It
seems to me that--you cite the Magna Carta, which is dealing with
selling justice, which was bribery. The New Hampshire framers of
their constitution chose to use the word "purchase" as opposed to
"sell." Do you see any distinction relative to the choice of that
word, which might or could have been construed to be an attempt
to change the language from the Magna Carta to a different mean-
ing?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I can see the basis for making the verbal
argument although, of course, you can't have a purchase without a
sale. So I did not find when I looked really any basis upon which I
thought I could really justify a distinction there. And as I think
you know from the Dionne case, I would not have been unhappy to
find that kind of a distinction because I thought the practice in-
volved there was a bad one.
  Senator HEFLIN. Of course, from a textual basis, as a method of
interpreting, when you see words change that usually has some
meaning to it. Well, that's quibbling over a point. I'm not going to
spend a lot of time on that.
  Let me ask you this. Have you ever been a crusader for a cause?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, I have.
  Senator HEFLIN. WTiat cause?
  Judge SOUTER. I guess my greatest crusade was the cause against
bringing casino gambling into the State of New Hampshire, which
I thought would destroy the political fabric of the State. I did not
believe that we could maintain--in a State with the resources that
we had, I did not believe that we had a very good chance of main-
taining the integrity of the law enforcement structure of the State
when the economy would have been so totally overbalanced by the
amount of money that would have come in for that purpose. And I
devoted a considerable period of my time one year as attorney gen-
eral to that crusade, if you will. It was not entirely popular in some
circles. It was an issue upon which the Governor, who had appoint-
ed me, and I broke. I am glad it turned out the way it did, and I
enjoyed the crusade.
  Senator HEFLIN. I gather, too, that you have had an interest in
medical issues, as some writer has mentioned, and an aunt of yours
had such an interest in it. What has been your interest in medical
research and your activities in that regard?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, my interest there, Senator, has been per-
haps less a research interest than an interest in local administra-
tion that brings health care to people. As I said yesterday, it all
started when I was asked to serve on the board of a hospital, and it
is one of those interests which sort of took off by increments, and I
                                      164

ended up finding it virtually a second job for a period of about 5
years in my life. But the focus was not a focus on academic re-
search so much as it was a focus upon the kind of administration
that gets health care to people and determines the cost that they
are going to have to pay for it.

  Senator HEFLJN. IS there any other cause that you would say
that you have been a crusader for?

  Judge SOUTER. Not a public crusader, no. There are some causes
to which I have contributed, but causes in which I have come out
as a public crusader I think have been limited to those.

  One of the things, I can tell you that the inhibitions on crusading
when you are occupying the position of attorney general or of
judge, of course, are there, as I think you know as well as I do. The
number of organizations that a judge finds himself slowly resigning
from in order to avoid recusal problems can sometimes be one of
the tragedies and in any case one of the prices that we pay for
being on the bench. And I have been through that experience, as
you know.

  Senator HEFIIN. Well, that is 7 years of your life. I mean, there
are other years, too.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, 12 years, actually; I was 7 on the supreme
court

  Senator HEFLIN. That's right.
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. Then I was on the trial court for 5.
  Senator HEFLIN. I want to go to the Seabrook demonstration
issue. Critics of you contend that you acted too strongly against the
demonstration. They contend that after demonstrators were arrest-
ed that they were not released on their personal recognizance, that
bail was required; that when they refused to post bail that the
State was required to house in the different instances as many as
1,400 detainees at enormous cost. The critics go on to say that in
trials where first a judge gave suspended sentences that you, ac-
cording to one critic, rushed to the courthouse to insist on the fact
that there be sentences of hard labor; and that in the efforts to pay
for the extra costs involved that there was an instance with the
Governor's crime commission under an LEAA grant where you
urged the crime commission to approve an application to LEAA to
seek funds to help pay for the expense; and that then later, the
State, through the Governor--perhaps some of your participation--
sought contributions from corporations and other people to pay for
it. They then cite that before a finance committee hearing on the
cost of the Seabrook demonstration that you testified in answer to
a legislator's question by saying that under certain circumstances
that the State might use police dogs and fire hoses to keep the
demonstrators from the site.
  Now, I recognize that if you are the attorney general, you have
certain responsibilities, and I want to ask you to relate your posi-
tion as to today. What would be your position today relative to
these various issues in regards to the demonstration that took
place here yesterday? How should that be treated? How do you
view today the demonstrators that hollered out when Senator
Grassley was testifying, and we all turned around and looked; we
were basically eyewitnesses to it.
                                      165

  Would you give us your opinion on the issue pertaining to per-
sonal recognizance versus bail; give us your opinion of what ought
to be done if they refuse to make bail; efforts to pay any extra cost;
the question pertaining to whether or not there ought to be sen-
tences in regards to those people that demonstrated?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, the first thing that I would have to
say is that I wouldn't give any final opinion on what should be
done with those demonstrators without hearing them; and the only
place that I heard them was in the back of the room. I haven't
heard them in a courtroom. I am happy that I haven't heard them
in the back of the room again, and I probably will never see them
in a courtroom, and I wouldn't make any final judgment about
what ought to be done without doing that.

  What I think I can usefully do is give you a sense of the signifi-
cant contrast between what went on here and what went on in the
case that I was dealing with when I did have to take a position and
did take a number of positions as attorney general of the State.

  The first thing you mentioned was the fact that I opposed their
release on personal recognizance bail. That is correct. That position
was taken on the night that the demonstrators were arrested fol-
lowing the second day of the demonstration.

  Now, the arrest occurred because the demonstrators at that time,
or the remnant of them--I think there had been about 3,500 or
4,000 there that day, and as it turned out there were about 1,400
left who refused sort of the last and final request to get out before
arrests started. At the time the arrests took place, those demon-
strators were occupying the parking lot that was used on a working
day by the work force that was building the nuclear power plant,
and they refused to leave it. One of the reasons that the State
police made the decision to arrest--a decision which I was aware of
and certainly took no exception to--was that they knew, this being
late on a Sunday afternoon, that at 7 on Monday morning the work
force was going to arrive in that parking lot, and they knew that if
that happened they had an extremely combustible mixture, and
what had been in fact a demonstration of civil disobedience was not
likely to remain one if that happened.

  When, therefore, they were arrested and arraigned at special sit-
tings of the local district courts to determine what the bail should
be, the question which confronted the State was: If personal recog-
nizance is granted, what will be the effect of that? And, in fact, the
demonstrators had indicated, as I recall it, quite publicly within
the armories where they had been brought, that as soon as they
were released on personal recognizance they were going to regroup
and go back to the parking lot and presumably be there the next
morning when the workers arrived.

  Therefore, I made a judgment that personal recognizance was, in
fact, simply going to render the action of removing of no use, and
the next morning we were going to have trouble on our hands. I
therefore decided that the appropriate requirement would be some
cash bail, conditioned upon good behavior and showing up for court
on time. I therefore recommended that cash bail of $100--probably
cash or bond, but that $100 be requested.

  As I think you know, that very issue was later litigated in a sec-
tion 1983 action that was brought against a number of State offi-
                                      166
cials, including me, and the U.S. district court concluded that that
was perfectly reasonable bail, that there was not any indication
that the people involved could not make it or that it was unreason-
able.

  I think it is safe to say--well, maybe I shouldn't say, but I think
it is safe to say that we do not need or would not need, probably, in
the aftermath of yesterday's incident, that particular kind of pru-
dential concern.

  The second thing you mentioned was my opposition to suspended
sentences and a request for hard labor. I don t know. The first part
of that is true, and the second is not, except in a very technical
legal sense. I did oppose purely suspended sentences because, as a
practical matter, they would not be sentences at all, and I thought
they would have no deterrent effect. And I think they would not
have had.

  I think I may safely say, although there is no record of the court
in question that I am aware of, that never in the course of my rec-
ommendation did I make any reference to hard labor. The only ref-
erence to hard labor that occurs in connection with these cases
occurs--or at least it did then--in the New Hampshire statutes.
The New Hampshire statutes refer to any incarceration, any incar-
ceration following conviction, whether it be in a house of correction
or the State prison, as being at hard labor. I know that in some
county houses of correction, of course, as you know, there are work
details just as there are in the prisons. But for practical purposes,
there is only a very attenuated sense of labor today.

  I was not interested in hard labor, and I don't believe I ever used
the term. In point of fact, a substantial number--I don't know
whether I could say most, but a substantial number of those dem-
onstrators never, in fact, even saw the inside of a house of correc-
tion because most of them--because they refused to make bail--
spent their 15 days in the National Guard armories where they
had been taken awaiting trial. And at the end of that time, as I
recall, I ordered them ejected because I didn't think they should be
staying in the house of correction longer than they would have
stayed if they had gotten the sentence that I had recommended. So,
to the best of my knowledge, there was no labor involved in any
aftermath.

  With respect to the crime commission, I was a member of the
Governor's Commission on Crime and Delinquency at that time. I
couldn't possibly tell you what the category of money was that
might have been available as Federal help for unusual law enforce-
ment expense. But, apparently, there was some such category of it,
and because this was a very expensive proposition for the State, I
urged and argued very strongly that the crime commission ought
to approve an application for it. I couldn't tell you at this point
whatever happened to the application. I don't know whether the
State got a grant to help defray expense or not.

  Senator HEFLJN. It did not. But the issue is that some of your
critics say that you argued before that crime commission to the
effect of almost threatening them with their existence unless they
went forward with

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I--excuse me. I reread one of the newspa-
pers that I had not looked at for 14 years, and I think I found the
                                          167

passage that you referred to. There was one member of the com-
mission at that time who claimed that I had--I forget whether he
used the word "threats" or "extortion" or whatnot as an induce-
ment to the members to vote for it. And I remember in the latter
part of that newspaper article the reporter said that he or she
could not find anyone else who was in the crime commission at
that time who would support that particular view.

  I think it is fair to say on the record that that was an eccentric
interpretation of what I had said, although there is no question
that I had argued very strongly that the commission ought to sup-
port the request for the grant. And I have no doubt whatsoever
that I indicated that the Governor felt very strongly that the com-
mission ought to do so. It was standard practice to bring such opin-
ions before the commission.

  The next issue about seeking contributions to defray expense is,
again, luckily once which I trust no one will have to face in re-
sponse to what happened yesterday around here. My understand-
ing of the sequence of what happened on that is this: The demon-
strations took place on the last day of April and the first day of
May back in 1977. According to my own records--and I think this
is also indicated in one of the discovery affidavits that I filed with
the U.S. district court--by the 3rd of May, I had formulated a posi-
tion on what the State should request in the trial of these cases,
which, as I said, was the 15 days and a fine of $200, the fine to be
suspended on good behavior.

  My appearance before the court that you referred to took place
on the 5th of May, which was the middle or the latter part of that
week. As I understand it, on the 6th of May, 3 days after I had for-
mulated the State's position and 2 days or 1 day after I had ap-
peared publicly in court to state it--on the 5th of May, the Gover-
nor issued sort of a request to the Nation to make contributions to
help defray the expense. He sort of went out publicly and passed
the hat.

   I have no recollection of discussing with the Governor the fund-
ing that this was going to cost except for the fact that there was
money available in an appropriation known as the emergency
fund, which was under the control of the Governor and council.
And there was also at that time--and I think it was during that
same week--a meeting of the finance committee of the New Hamp-
shire Senate before whom a request for an emergency appropria-
tion had been made to be appended to a pending bill. And I do
recall discussing with him my appearance before the Senate. I did
appear before the Senate. Some people were relatively happy to
vote money and some were not, but that was the extent of my
fundraising activity.

  I know--rather, I have been reminded in the last couple of weeks
as material has been assembled on this--that subsequent to that,
the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, who was the principal
owner at that time of the nuclear powerplant, made a contribution
to the State of New Hampshire of around $70,000, in round figures.
That came, according to the records that I have gotten, late in
June. I think it was June 30. At least, that is the date on which I
have a record of State action to accept the funds.
                                      168
  If there was any particular appeal to the Public Service Co., it
was something that had nothing to do with me or my office. The
one thing I do know about it beyond the date is that the amount
was determined as the amount necessary to offset the extra law en-
forcement pay expenses for the weekend of the demonstration. And
so far as I know, discussions about any contribution from the
Public Service Co. took place between the department of safety,
which includes the State police, and the company. In any event, it
was the department of safety that made the accounting for funds,
and it did not involve me or my office.
  The last thing you mentioned would similarly be happily unnec-
essary and inappropriate in the kind of disturbance we had yester-
day morning, and that was police dogs and fire hoses. I was sort of
unhappy to hear about the police dogs and fire hoses because I had
spent a fair amount of my energy in the week or so prior to this
big demonstration indicating that I was not going to use police dogs
and fire hoses, and that I wasn't particularly happy to be facing
the demonstration, but that a matter of civil disobedience did not
call for police dogs and fire hoses.
  I think in the course of that senate hearing in which the ex-
penses that was being accrued was not the most popular political
subject in the State at the time, one of the senators--in fact, I
think it was the senator from my own district--said instead of
wasting all this money and putting them through the criminal jus-
tice system and convicting and sentencing them, he said, "Why
didn't you just drive them away with police dogs and fire hoses?'
My recollection is that I said that was, if appropriate, it was only
appropriate in a riot situation in which there was no other way to
control it. And I said that is not what we had.
  So I seem to have gotten metamorphosed from an anti-police dog
and fire hose man into a pro-police dog and fire hose man. And I
would kind of like to go back to the prior position and leave that as
mine on the record.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Another issue that critics have
brought up is your letter pertaining to the parental consent on a
minor's abortion, in which, in 1981, you wrote to the chairman of
the New Hampshire house committee on health and welfare on
behalf of the New Hampshire Superior Court judges.
  Now, as I understand it from what Senator Rudman has in-
formed me, you have a system of courts where the New Hampshire
Superior Court judges go all over the State. They don't have limit-
ed geographical areas that they serve in, and they sort of travel a
circuit relative to these matters. On that issue, of course, I read
that you don't express any opinion one way or the other on the
substantive issue, but it raises a question which has been always
raised as to whether judges ought to become involved, in effect, in
lobbying legislators. That raises an issue to what extent judges
should participate in the legislative process.
  Now, I notice in reading further that at a later date, some 7, 8
years later, when you were on the supreme court, this issue arose
again, and you as a member of the supreme court referred the
person that was asking you about it to the superior court judges,
which could indicate that you didn't think as a member of the su-
preme court that you ought to be involved in what you were in-
                                      169
volved in when you were a superior court judge. If you would ad-
dress that, or whatever you want to say about this particular
letter.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir, I will. That letter actually came back to
my attention within, I think, the first week of my nomination, so it
was one of the earliest pieces of prior history that I reread. That
letter was written by me in my capacity, I think at the time, as
chairman of what was known as the legislation committee of the
superior court. The superior court did not take, and very scrupu-
lously avoided taking, positions on general social issues--or even
law enforcement issues, for that matter--except insofar as they
would impinge on the capacity of the court to do its job. To the
extent that there was going to be an expansion of jurisdiction with-
out an expansion of judges to handle the business, we would bring
that to the attention of the legislature, for example.

  On this particular issue, the appropriateness of using a superior
court judge as the deciding authority for permitting or refusing an
abortion upon a juvenile when parental consent was not available,
the court felt very strongly on two grounds that it was an inappro-
priate position to place the judiciary in. Those grounds were ex-
pressed in the letter.

  There were some judges who, for reasons of their own moral
scruples, would not under any circumstances authorize an abortion
as, in effect, a surrogate for parents. There was another group of
judges who believed very strongly, not because they opposed abor-
tion personally but because they believed that it was inappropriate
for a judge to make what was in their view an unavoidably moral
decision for another person, that they should not engage in that
kind of an exercise of jurisdiction.

  The upshot of these two views was that if the bill was passed, it
was a virtual certainty that a significant portion of the superior
court bench--which at that time I think in the State was probably
around 18 judges--would find itself, for one or the other of those
reasons, unable to discharge the function that would have devolved
upon them. And I think, as I said in that letter, the court's view
was that this is necessarily going to lead to judge-shopping. No
minor or no person on behalf of a minor would want to appear in
front of a judge whose moral views were known to be opposed to
abortion. And at the very least, the result was going to be that a
very small number of judges were, in fact, going to find themselves
exercising the entire court's jurisdiction in these matters.

  It was for that reason that the court, as I recall, unanimously be-
lieved that it would be inappropriate for the judges to be given that
job. I think I was chairman of the committee at that time, and I
drafted a letter to that effect. But that is representative of the
limits on lobbying that the judges do. It was lobbying only to the
extent of bringing to the attention of the legislature matters which
they would not know, but which we as judges felt they had to know
if they were going to make intelligent decisions.

  Now, you are quite right to recall to my mind the fact that the
issue did arise later on when I was on the supreme court. And one
of the members of the legislature came to me at that time and said,
well, will you sort of reauthorize this letter as a statement of the
judicial position. And I said that I could not do so for two reasons.
                                      170
The first is it was the position of the superior court, and I was no
longer on the superior court. The second and equally strong one
was that if the legislature did not, in fact, take the advice--if that
is what the superior court still wanted done, and the legislature did
not take the advice--it was virtually inevitable that there would be
issues brought before the New Hampshire Supreme Court involv-
ing matters of constitutionality, involving claims that judges, in
fact, could not avoid this kind of responsibility. And it seemed to
me necessary that I not become involved in the kind of legislation
that might lead to that sort of an issue, and that I be very careful
not to allow the name of the supreme court to be associated with it.

  My own guess is that if there literally had been an action
brought before the supreme court, it probably would have been in a
posture in which I would have felt it necessary to recuse myself.
But it still would have been the case that there would have been a
supreme court justice taking a position. And so, quite apart from
the fact that it was not an issue for the supreme court, there was a
very strong reason to keep the supreme court at a distance from
the resolution of the issue in case eventually there was litigation
about it.

  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU don't have any more time, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. That takes care of that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Humphrey of New Hampshire.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Mr. Chairman, it is now after noon. Anxious
as I am to have my turn here, I certainly would not object to your
giving our esteemed witness a break, if you would choose to do so.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have no objection to that. I have been talking
with the witness and his people constantly, checking at every 15
minutes or so. Their preference is as follows--just so you know I
am taking care of your brethren from New Hampshire.
  Senator HUMPHREY. All right.
  The CHAIRMAN. Their preference is that we go through and
finish the first round, have you speak, then have Senator Simon
and Senator Kohl, and then break, and then have three of us ask
questions in the afternoon and then stop.
  Do you have objection to that, Senator?
  Senator HUMPHREY. None whatsoever, as long as the witness still
has a pulse, we can continue.
  Judge Souter, one of the things that we few non-lawyers on this
committee have noticed is that the lawyers tend to get bogged
down in what we regard, at least, as minutia and acrania, not to
say that those things are not important sometimes, but for my
part, I want to try to back off and approach from a fresh perspec-
tive.
  I want to start by reciting what for me is the most fundamental
statement, indeed the most eloquent statement on human rights
ever written: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator"--and I
emphasize "creator"--"with certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
  As you know, and as I will point out for my colleagues, the New
Hampshire Bill of Rights, the New Hampshire Constitution, the
                                      171

first part, the Bill of Rights incorporates that very same concept,
not as a lofty expression, but as a concrete part of our Constitution.

  I read articles I and II: "All men are born equally free and inde-
pendent, therefore, all government of right originates from the
people is founded in consent and instituted for the general good."

  Article II: "All men have certain natural, essential and inherent
rights, among which are the enjoying and defending life and liber-
ty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property and," in a word,
"seeking and attaining happiness."

  Do you agree with the declaration in the first two articles of the
New Hampshire Constitution, Judge Souter, that there are certain
rights which precede even the State?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, I think, in fact, that is the kind of concept
which is recognized and which is reflected in the theory of limited
governmental power and which is at the focus of our search for an
appropriate meaning to the scope of liberty protections.

  Senator HUMPHREY. SO, when you say, as you did yesterday,
something to the effect that power comes from the people, you do
not mean to suggest that a majority of the people have--that a ma-
jority of the people may violate, even through government, certain
inherent rights of each human being?

  Judge SOUTER. I mean, as you suggest, that power can only come
from the people, yes.

  Senator HUMPHREY. That is not quite my question, though. You
made it quite clear in the response to my first question that you
believe that there are certain inherent rights that precede the
State. My question now is can a majority of people, acting through
government, even acting through government, violate such inher-
ent rights?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, we know that some of those inherent rights,
of course, are reflected in the specific provisions of the Bill of
Rights, and I have also said in the course of my testimony today
that it is one of the objects, as we now analyze these problems, is
one of the objects of the liberty clause, both in the State constitu-
tion and in the National Constitution, to define and protect this
point beyond which government simply cannot go or cannot go
without the most strong justification.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, I am heartened to hear your subscrip-
tion to the belief of the Founders that we have certain inherent
rights that precede the State.

  I want to return again to the Declaration of Independence and
pick up where so often people leave off. We all know that famous
expression of Jefferson, "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
Unfortunately, he got the property part screwed up, but New
Hampshire fixed it in their constitution and made it clear that
"pursuit of happiness" means, as it was generally meant in those
days, the possession and enjoyment of property.

  But to get back to that famous expression "for all people for all
times, that they are endowed by their creator," and so on, "certain
inalienable rights," and then pick up where people so often leave
off, because this next part is so important, too, "and that to secure
those rights, governments are instituted among men."
                                      172

   Therefore, would you agree with the Founders that the funda-
mental purpose of government then is to secure those inalienable
rights in which we are all endowed by our creator?

  Judge SOUTER. That is a fundamental purpose and, as you know
from just the structure of the constitution in our own State, that
was the purpose which the drafters and the Founders saw fit to ex-
press before they had even addressed the question about the appro-
priate structure of government.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes, indeed, they put it right up front. By
this line of questioning, I do not mean to suggest that there are
rights that are unlimited. When one's rights bump up against an-
other's, then immediately we begin to have limits. We call for lib-
erty, not license, and that is I think the concept on which our gov-
ernment was founded and has evolved in very great detail.

  Well, Judge Souter, under the Constitution, can there be the
right of one human being to take the life of another, except in self-
defense, when threatened by that other human being?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, we know, Senator, subject to the Constitu-
tion, that there traditionally certainly have been circumstances.
The example of the death penalty, as you know, is recognized right
in the Constitution

  Senator HUMPHREY. Permit me to interrupt there. What I mean
was, is there the right of one human being, acting separately, not
corporately as society or government, but one human being acting
separately to take the life of another, except in self-defense, when
threatened by this other human being?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, are you asking this as a question of consti-
tutional law, now, not a moral, not a personal moral issue?

  Senator HUMPHREY. I will ask it first as a personal moral ques-
tion.

  Judge SOUTER. I can certainly conceive of circumstances in which
it would be arguably justifiable to take another's life, even though
mine personally was not threatened. There is the object of war, the
example of war, the example of protecting one's family. You would
protect your child, even though your life was not threatened.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Fair enough, but the intent of my question
was to focus on a situation where one individual, not acting with
authority of government, as one does in war, and I did not antici-
pate the conditions of a family being threatened. But I am trying
to focus on a situation where one human being elects to take the
life of another, which other human being does not represent a
threat to the life of the first.

  Judge SOUTER. I think probably I and everyone in this room
would accept the proposition, the general proposition that life, of
course, morally should not be taken without justification. Where
we would find our points of difficulty might come in either defining
the concept of life or defining the very concept of justification that
arguably would be brought up in argument.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Defining life seems to be a problem that the
Supreme Court has encountered, inexplicably, from my point of
view, but that is something I will put off for a later time, if I may.

  Would you agree with my understanding of Roe y. Wade and the
subsequent decisions, the progeny, as the lawyers like to say? You
know, there is certain lawyer language which is used to justify the
                                      173

exorbitant hourly fees that they charge, so I will try to keep my
language simple.

  Judge SOUTER. Those were the millions that I could have been
earning, if I

  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes. [Laughter.]
  Those other decisions, Roe and the ones that followed, would you
agree with my understanding that Roe and the progeny established
an enforceable right to abortion during all nine months, if, for ex-
ample, the mother asserted continued pregnancy represented a
threat to her health, including mental or emotional health?
  Judge SOUTER. The extent of recognition in the cases of mental
or emotional health is something that I am not clear on the legal
development on, but certainly there is recognition of the possibility
of abortion to save the life of the mother or to save serious injury
to her health.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, it is much more than that, and I am
not mistaken on this point, that Roe and progeny establish--the
reason I raise this, it is kind of a rhetorical question, really, and I
know you are going to stay arms-length from this, and I under-
stand your point of view.
  You know, there are a lot of people watching, including young
people, for which this is a wonderful lesson in history and in consti-
tutional government, who probably do not understand that Roe and
the decisions which followed it and reinforced it and expanded it
established a right to have an abortion during any time of the nine
months of gestation, for the health of the mother, which includes
the emotional or mental health. So that if a woman raises the
claim that pregnancy affects here emotional health, that is suffi-
cient to secure an abortion.
  That, of course, is the massive loophole through which 98 or, say,
95 percent upwards of the abortions in this country are secured.
And when you look at the surveys, the interviews with women who
have had abortions, they never say that--I should not say never--
they rarely say that they sought the abortion because of emotional
health or mental health, or even physical health in most cases, but,
rather, because they were unmarried or it would interrupt school
plans and things like that, which are not insignificant, but I just
want to make the point that this is a massive loophole in existing
law through which most of these abortions are secured. At least I
view it as a loophole; others may not, but I certainly do. That is a
critical bit of information, that one can secure abortion during any
of the nine months of pregnancy by establishing that claim.
  Surely, you will be able to respond to this question: Roe v. Wade
and progeny did not establish an obligation on the part of any indi-
vidual or any institution to perform abortions. That is correct, is it
not?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, we recognize that, and, of course, those issues
have been raised in the funding cases, too.
  Senator HUMPHREY. SO there is no obligation on the part of
anyone, including the Federal Government, as we have known
from many challenges, to facilitate abortion in any way, either fi-
nancially or in any material way, because, as the Court has said,
there is no obligation on the part of the government to subsidize
the exercise of rights.
                                      174
  Judge, you were a member of the board of trustees of the Con-
cord Hospital from 1971 to 1985. In 1973, the trustees voted to
begin performing abortions in that hospital. Have you said for the
record how you voted on that issue?
  Judge SOUTER. I think I have, but I voted for the resolution, and
my recollection is that the specific terms of the resolution allowed
abortion consistent with was then the new legal era inaugurated in
the terms of Roe v. Wade. My recollection--and this is simply
something I am not clear of, after this time, but I think there had
previously been probably a hospital or staff bylaw referring specifi-
cally to the preexisting New Hampshire statutes
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. And that, as a result of Roe v. Wade,
there was need to revise them.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Right. So you voted in support of the policy
change, the result of which the hospital began to perform abor-
tions, consistent with the law, of course?
  Judge SOUTER. That abortions could be performed within the hos-
pital, and my recollection also is that the resolution was explicit in
saying that this did not obligate a given hospital employee or medi-
cal staff member to do anything against conscience.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Good. Good.
  Well, I am not asking you in this next question to comment on
Roe v. Wade, that is, its correctness, but I would ask you to explain
your vote, as a trustee of the Concord Hospital. Clearly, the hospi-
tal was under no obligation to begin performing abortions. Why did
you choose to support a change in policy such that the hospital
began to perform abortions?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, the change in policy was to allow doctors
who chose to perform abortions as a medical procedure in that hos-
pital, to do so consistently with Roe v. Wade. The resolution was
not--and I do not think this was the point of your question, but the
resolution was not intended to make the performance of abortions
a hospital function, as opposed to a function of the medical staff
which practiced independently within that hospital.
  The reason the hospital took that position and the reason I voted
for it was that Concord Hospital was a community hospital, it was
not tied to any sectarian affiliation, it served people of all religious
and moral beliefs, its medical staff represented all religious and
moral beliefs, and so did the patients who went through the hospi-
tal.
  We did not believe that it was appropriate for us, whatever
might be the moral views of a given trustee, to impose those views
upon the hospital, when in fact it was the law of the United States
that a given procedure was lawful.
  It was, of course, a further justification, and I cannot tell you off-
hand how much weight that justification played in the minds of
any one trustee, but it, of course, was a serious one, and that was,
given the fact that the hospital would be available for abortions, if
a doctor chose to perform one there.
  One of the functions which the hospital was giving to the com-
munity was the function of the greatest degree of safety in medical
care, and if abortions are going to be performed as, by law, they
could be performed, it was appropriate in a nonsectarian hospital
                                          175

to allow the full range of backup services for the safety of the
mother and, indeed, for the safety of all participants, and we felt--
and I do now feel--the hospital had an obligation to do that.

  Senator HUMPHREY. SO you did not feel in that case that it was
appropriate to bring to bear any moral judgment, is that what you
are saying?

  Judge SOUTER. I did not.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Does your vote back then in any way indi-
cate that you feel that unborn human beings are not persons?
  Judge SOUTER. My vote has no such implication. My judgment
with respect to the appropriateness of the procedure in a hospital
of which I was a trustee is no more a reflection of a personal moral
view of mine, pro or con, than would be any judgment that I was
required to make as a judge of a court.

  Senator HUMPHREY. It might be fun to explore why you feel such
a decision should be value-neutral, why you should not bring your
moral judgment to bear in such a situation. I have already used
more than half of my time and I want to keep going, but I certain-
ly am willing to yield to you, if you want to reply in any greater
depth on that question.

  Judge SOUTER. I will leave the questions to you, Senator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Let's look at the other end of the continuum
of human life. With respect to the 14th amendment, are there any
precedents in our law that have stripped, for example, elderly per-
sons of their right to life, without due process of the law?

  Judge SOUTER. I am not aware of what you may be getting at or
anything that I could respond to your question.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, I am not aware of any such prece-
dents. I could be mistaken, but I am not aware of any. My point is
that: One retains the protection of the 14th amendment; namely
that one may not be deprived of life without due process of law, no
matter what one's condition. If one is unconscious, one is still a
person and protected by the 14th amendment. Is that not so?

  Judge SOUTER. I think there is no question, 14th amendment lib-
erty includes liberty in that situation.

   Senator HUMPHREY. Yes. If one
  Judge SOUTER. AS you know, it raises very great difficulties.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Oh, yes. If one is unable to fend for one's
self, unable to speak for one's self, unable to defend for one's self,
unable to eat or drink for one's self, unable to attend to toilet ne-
cessities, even unable to breathe on one's own, one is still a person
and protected by the 14th amendment.
  Judge SOUTER. There is no question, that liberty
  Senator HUMPHREY. NO question about that.
  Judge SOUTER. There is no question, that liberty interests extend
to every living human being. In answering that, of course, as I am
sure you do not intend, I am not giving opinions about the validity
of living wills and things of that sort. But the appropriateness of
the 14th amendment is an invocation of right and is open to every-
one.
   Senator HUMPHREY. Yes. You say the liberty provision of the
14th amendment extends to every living human being. What is the
difference between a living human being and a person?
                                      176
  Judge SOUTER. Without being more specific about the legal con-
text, Senator, I don't know that I would see any point in drawing
that kind of a distinction. I portend nothing by that answer, but I
just think that is the kind of statement that one really cannot
make without being misleading, unless one makes it in a very spe-
cific context.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, it is a very important question. It is a
pivotal question. I may want to come back to that in a second
round.
  Yesterday you said you counseled a couple whose union had re-
sulted in conception, in this case an unplanned pregnancy. That
was in 1966?
  Judge SOUTER. I think that was in 1964 or 1965.
  Senator HUMPHREY. My information is that in no State was elec-
tive abortion legal until 1977, California being the first State to
permit it. I don't want to even approach an intrusion into the pri-
vacy relationship in terms of identity or outcome, but did you coun-
sel the couple to remain within the law?
  Judge SOUTER. Without invading the privacy which they have a
right to expect, I think the only thing, Senator, that I can tell you
is that I counseled them against taking the kind of, in fact, danger-
ous action which one of them had described to me they had in
mind.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I think I misspoke a moment ago. The first
law permitting elective abortion was enacted in 1967. Evidently I
said 1977.
  Judge, you remember the old television program "Queen for a
Day"?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, it wasn't something that I spent much of
my youth watching, but I have heard the term. [Laughter.]
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes; going back to the days of black and
white TV. Let's play Senator for a day.
  Judge SOUTER. I still have a black and white TV.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I don't doubt it. [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. They were right about me on that one, I'll tell
you.
  Senator LEAHY. We are surprised you have that.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, I hope you don't watch it much. My
theory is that nothing would do more good for this country than
for everyone to smash his television set. So I outdo even you on
that one because people would begin, especially parents and chil-
dren would begin talking, and children would begin doing their
homework instead of watching and having their minds filled with
rubbish every evening from our wonderful networks. That is an-
other subject and another speech.
  Let's play Senator for a day, Judge. Put yourself in our shoes, if
you will, for a few minutes. If you were up here on this side of the
table in the room, what would you be concerned about in confirm-
ing or not a Supreme Court Justice? In other words, what is impor-
tant? What should we be trying to do here? What is it we should be
concerned about, and what should citizens be concerned about?
What are the dangers inherent in this massive power which the
Supreme Court enjoys by virtue of the lifetime tenure of members
who are accountable to no one in any practical sense?
                                          177

  This is, again, not so much for my benefit--although I have no
doubt I will learn something from your insights--but especially the
young people who are tuned in.

  The CHAIRMAN. On television.
  Senator HUMPHREY. On television; yes. [Laughter.]
  I might have to make an amendment to my statement.
  Judge SOUTER. Even network television.
  Senator HUMPHREY. NO, cable; cable. The networks don't bother,
too much.
  Judge SOUTER. Of course, I would start just where you start, Sen-
ator. You have a responsibility to inquire into competence. You
have a responsibility to inquire into personal integrity, a responsi-
bility, certainly, to inquire into basic knowledge of the Constitution
and its values. Then there is, as is frequently spoken of in connec-
tion with the ABA's inquiry, there is an inquiry into judicial tem-
perament.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Maybe my question was too broad, and
excuse me for interrupting. I would like you to comment on the
dangers inherent in a judiciary appointed for life and accountable,
really, to no one.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, the danger inherent, I suppose, is that the
judiciary can devolve into an institution for the expression of
purely personal values. The institution itself is one step removed
from the democratic process. Fortunately, that is only one step be-
cause the democratic process is going on in this room. But

   Senator K ^'DHREY. Yes, it is. Permit me again to interrupt. It is
a mighty big one step removed. This is our one opportunity. You
are going to be over there for decades, for good, I hope and trust
and believe. But it is not a small step removed; it is a huge step
removed.

  Judge SOUTER. Because of that step, as you point out or indicate,
subject to impeachment, there is no recall. There is no second-
guessing.

   I would not be true to my own sense of constitutional principle if
I did not say that the Senate ought to be looking for someone who,
in seeking the very difficult or in going through the very difficult
process sometimes of seeking constitutional meaning, would seek
for something outside that judge's personal views for that moment,
who would seek to infuse into the Constitution a sense of enduring
value, not of ephemeral value, and who would try to rest that proc-
ess on as objective an inquiry as can be possible, given the great
breadth that is necessary when we do search for value, for these
massive generalities and magnificent generalities that are commit-
ted to us.

   But I could not end an answer to that without saying that with
the best will in the world to avoid the changing and the ephemeral
and the purely personal, a judge in the long run is going to go
wrong unless that judge is willing to listen.

  The fact is we learn much from what goes on in courtrooms. I
think some people tend to look upon--people perhaps who have not
been through the judicial process, I think they tend to look at it
with suspicion as to whether what goes on in courtrooms, including
appellate courtrooms, is really capable of changing judges' minds
                                      178
or influencing the way they think or forcing them to refine their
views.

  One of the things I know from personal experience is that the
process works. I mentioned yesterday that although I didn't come
down with any statistics, I have kept track of my own performance
listening to oral arguments and reading briefs. And I can think of
instances, some specific and some in general, when my mind has
been changed by what I heard and by what I read and by what I
thought after an argument. Ultimately, you cannot choose, you
must not choose, a judge who is not open to that kind of influence.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes; I quite agree with that. We all must be
able to listen and to change our minds when the facts indicate.

  Have you seen any trends in the Supreme Court? The Court
changes, of course, in tenor over a long period of time, oscillating
back and forth. Have you seen any trends in the Supreme Court
decisions in the last 40 years that give you any cause for worry?

  Judge SOUTER. There is no question that there have been times
when I have been concerned about the wisdom of individual court
decisions. I was in law enforcement once, and there were times
when I used to chafe over the difficulty that law enforcement had
in conforming to some of the Warren court decisions.

  One of the things I am glad of is that that is an era which has, in
large measure, passed. We do not have the same problems that we
had 20 years ago. There are some who would say there is a greater
pragmatic appreciation on the Supreme Court. You know, there is
also a much greater degree of practical pragmatism in the entities
who come before the Court. We have learned to live with much in
the last 20 years, and we have lived with it reasonably well.

  I am not standing here, leaving aside my position as the nomi-
nee, fearful of one trend or another. I could be critical about indi-
vidual decisions. There are decisions which we will undoubtedly
discuss in the course of the next afternoon or the next day or two,
some of which I would have come out differently on. Any lawyer
and any judge can say that. But I don't have an alarm to raise
with you at this moment.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you. I may pursue that later, but my
time is up. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge, let me apologize for getting up and down this morning
myself. I happen to be chairman of the European Affairs Subcom-
mittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I have drafted an
alternative to the War Powers Act, which I have been attempting
to negotiate with the administration since it came into office. One
of the issues before us now is whether or not there will be a con-
gressional authorization proposed for the action taking place in the
Gulf, and I have drafted such a detailed proposal. That is in negoti-
ation among Senators now, and that, coupled with new actions
today in the Gulf, have required me to occasionally get up and
attend to another duty. But it is not because I don't want to hear
every word you have to say. So I do apologize.
  Judge SOUTER. NO apology is needed, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me propose the following, and this is a
moving target here: Let me suggest that when I finish saying this
we just stand for 3 minutes to get a seventh-inning stretch here to
                                          179

give you a chance to stretch your legs, then come back back and
have Senator Simon. That will take us until about 1:30. If Senator
Kohl doesn't mind, we will have him come and be the first person
after lunch, and we will spend 2 hours after lunch. We will have
four people question after lunch. I don't know who the four will be
because I am not sure whomever the four in order will be here.
That would take us until roughly 4 o'clock, unless any particular
Senator has an overwhelming requirement to want to question
today.

   It is now about 8 minutes of. We will recess until 5 minutes of,
come back, and Senator Simon will begin with his questioning.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. In order to stop Senator Rudman's press confer-
ence, I think we should [Laughter.]
  Actually, I haven't given the witness an opportunity to get back
out here yet. He has not been warned. We are about to begin.
  Thank you very much, Judge. What we are going to do now, we
will go to Senator Simon and then we will either break or, depend-
ing on what the Senator from Wisconsin has to entreat me, what
he has to say, we will either go to lunch or go to him.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Let me just digress for one moment, Mr. Chairman, if I may have
your attention over here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry.
  Senator SIMON. That is quite all right. I just wanted to call atten-
tion to one thing that Senator Thurmond just mentioned in pass-
ing. He said this is the 23d Supreme Court nominee that he is
having a hearing on. That is a remarkable record. I wonder if any
United States Senator has ever done that.
  The CHAIRMAN. I doubt whether anyone has, but I am beginning
to tally them up so much that I would like to pass a resolution that
there be no more. [Laughter.]
  Because I have nowhere near that number, but in half the
number of years that I have been there, it has been an incredibly--
it seems I have spent most of my life sitting here having the oppor-
tunity to be educated. I mean that sincerely.
  At any rate, I don't think there is anybody else, I would imagine,
that had that many in any one time frame.
  Senator SIMON. I would doubt it. I just thought it ought to be
noted.
  Let me kind of tell you where I am at this point, Judge Souter.
On the positive side--and some of these things perhaps some
people will think are minor--your use of language is good. You
speak clearly and concisely, not in convoluted sentences. We are
going to get those kind of opinions out of the Court if you are
there. Clearly, you are a listener and you are astute. I like that.
Then there is one kind of amorphous quality I will simply call sta-
bility that I see in you, and I like that. You have indicated you are
willing to stand against popular opinion. And when we look back,
for example, on what the Supreme Court did in the case of Japa-
nese Americans in 1942, I want a Supreme Court Justice who is
willing to stand up to popular opinion.
                                      180

   What is less clear for me is in two areas, and that is what I want
to question you about. One is whether you are going to be a leader
for civil liberties; and, second, whether you will be a leader for
those less fortunate. In the area of civil liberties, if I may follow
through on the questions of Senator Specter, you indicated that
you at least tentatively accept the tripartite test of the Lemon case
that the Court has used since 1971.

  Let me give you a specific example that is long past and just
kind of get, without any kind of a commitment, your visceral re-
sponse. I remember when we had a school prayer issue before the
House when I served in that body. Congressman Dan Glickman
from Wichita, KS--who happens to be Jewish--told me a story
about when he was in the fourth grade. Every morning he was ex-
cused while they had prayer, and then he would be brought in.
Every morning little Danny Glickman was being told "You're dif-
ferent." All the other fourth graders were being told the same.

  Is your feeling that that kind of an exercise violates the Lemon
test?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes. I think to begin with it is an appalling fact. I
happen to have a friend who is on the bench who described exactly
the same experience to me growing up in Manchester, NH. He was
Jewish. He didn't leave the room every morning, but he was cut
apart from the rest of his class when the Christian Lord's Prayer
was recited.

  The fact is the Supreme Court today I think has carried the law
to the point where a period of time for silence which may be used
for any meditative or non-meditative purpose that a child may
want has not been declared to be a violation of Lemon v. Kurtz-
man. But I think it is probably equally clear that the use of prayer
which has, as you describe it so graphically, the kind of exclusion-
ary effect is by virtue of that very evidence a kind of use of prayer
which, under the Lemon test, would have presumptive religious
purpose and presumptive religious effect. As I understand Lemon v.
Kurtzman, that would certainly violate it.

  It also calls to mind the alternative formulations which in some
of the recent cases Justice O'Connor has been referring to, and she
has been adverting to exactly the phenomenon that you have de-
scribed. She has been saying what we should be looking for is
whether the practice in question and its effect on people has the
kind of effect of telling them that you are somehow outside the le-
gitimate scope of our real community. She is looking for that kind
of sometimes subtle and sometimes very gross exclusionary effect.

  Senator SIMON. When you are 13th on a list of questioners, you
have to skip around a bit when it's your turn to question. Follow-
ing up on what Senator Humphrey asked, in this case where you
told Senator Metzenbaum about counseling the couple in Massa-
chusetts, where the statute at that time prohibited all abortions,
even if the life of the mother was at stake, did you reflect at all at
that point on the wisdom of that statute in Massachusetts? Do you
recall?

  Judge SOUTER. On that particular afternoon, the immediate prob-
lem before me, as I recall, probably did not take me that far. I had
a very immediate problem in front of me that afternoon, and I
think we probably confined the philosophy to the immediate
                                      181
danger. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the
details.

  Senator SIMON. I understand that, but afterwards even, not just
that afternoon, did you reflect on that?

  Judge SOUTER. No one could avoid recognizing the consequences
of that statute for the options that were available. That was obvi-
ous to all of us.

  Senator SIMON. In discussing the right to privacy, you used the
phrase "the fundamental marital right to privacy." Let me ask
why that is fundamental more than other rights to privacy, includ-
ing, say, the right to have privacy in a phone conversation or other
things.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I used that not as an implicit exclusion of
something else but as a subject matter that we have become famil-
iar with. Our approaches to it, our judicial formulations of it have
varied back and forth over the years. But going right back to the
time of the often disputed cases of Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v.
Society of Sisters, the Court has confronted, whether precisely or
imprecisely, the fact that there is a core set of family values which,
in the general understanding and the traditional understanding of
the American people, are protected. And so we, in fact, have had a
great deal of time in this century to be thinking in those terms,
and that is the most familiar focus for what we are talking about.
But I do not mean that to be a focus which implicitly excludes
other interests.

  As I said a moment ago, there is no question that the judiciary of
the United States is going to be spending a significant amount of
time in the years ahead trying to give attention to other claims--
indeed, giving attention to other claims and trying to adjudicate.

  Senator SIMON. Yesterday, in discussing the right to privacy,
there was a discussion of the 9th amendment and the 14th amend-
ment. But in the Constitution there are other provisions which
guarantee the right to privacy as well. You can't come into my
home without a very specific search warrant. The Constitution says
you can't quarter militia in my home.

  There is in the Constitution a sense of a right to privacy. That is
not a question. I guess I should reverse that. Is there in the Consti-
tution a general sense of the right of privacy?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think perhaps it is wrong to go back and
say you have answered my question for me.

  Senator SIMON. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. But you have there. We find, as you point out on
the provisions against the quartering of troops, the provisions
against unreasonable search and seizures, the provisions against
compelled self-incrimination, which gets you out of a kind of physi-
cal context. There are, indeed, reflections of what we could in a
general way describe as privacy interests there. And as it goes
without saying, the great debate has been the extent to which a
privacy interest not so specifically recognized must be assumed
under the concept of liberty. I have taken the position, although I
cannot say here what its extent may ultimately be determined to
be or what I would find it to be, yes, there is a core that goes
beyond those specific pinpoints.

          39-454--91-

  Senator SIMON. Then if I can, I am going to shift over to the gen-
eral area of your concern for those who are less fortunate in our
society. For one reason or another, I received a letter from the
AFL-CIO saying all of the David Souter decisions have been on the
side of management, not on the side of the workers. I frankly
haven't made an analysis of your record in that regard. Perhaps
you have not.

  Judge SOUTER. I have not either, no.
  Senator SIMON. Does that sound like it is possible?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the only thing I can say in the abstract is
I have to decide the cases that come to me. I would only ask you to
look at those cases and see whether in your judgment they were
decided fairly. I do not have a pro-labor or a pro-management
agenda. I can say that this gets us somewhat outside the labor
area, but I can't help but remember that in one of the early weeks
or so following my nomination, there was an article--I think it was
in the business section of the Sunday Times--on "Is this a friend of
business?" And I remember one of the conclusions in there was
that this is not a nominee who is out to rescue business from its
bad decisions or from its improvidence. And I hope in any such
weighing as you may believe it right to do, you would bear that in
mind, too, because I think there is, indeed, a record on that point.
  Senator SIMON. There is a newspaper article that quotes you as
saying in a speech that affirmative action is affirmative discrimina-
tion. And I combine that with your statement, if I jotted it down
correctly yesterday, that there is no discrimination in New Hamp-
shire. My guess is that even the two percent or three percent of the
blacks in New Hampshire would probably give a different answer
than you provided yesterday. My guess is that there are a lot of
women in New Hampshire who would give you a different answer.
There might be some French Canadians by origin who would give
you a different answer.
  I am concerned by a statement that says affirmative action is af-
firmative discrimination, if you were quoted correctly.
  Judge SOUTER. I think that--I hope that was not the exact quote
because I don't believe that. The kind of discrimination that I was
talking about in that speech was discrimination, as I described it
and as I recall being quoted in the paper about it, a discrimination
in the sense that benefits were to be distributed according to some
formula of racial distribution, having nothing to do with any reme-
dial purpose but simply for the sake of reflecting a racial distribu-
tion.
  That is to be contrasted in two absolutely essential respects, from
on the one hand affirmative action and on the other hand the kind
of distributive remedy which it is appropriate for courts and, to a
degree yet to be fully developed, appropriate for Congress to consid-
er.
  I would suppose it would go without saying today that if we are
in the United States to have the kind of society which I described
yesterday as the society which I knew or found reflected in my
home, there will be a need--and I am afraid for a longer time that
we would like to say--a need for the affirmative action which seeks
out qualified people who have been discouraged by generations of
societal discrimination from taking their place in the mainstream
                                      183
and in all of America and in all the distribution of its benefits and
its burdens. That is an obligation of individuals, and it is an obliga-
tion of government.

  I think it also goes without saying that when we consider the
power of the judiciary to remedy discrimination which has been
proven before the judiciary, the appropriate response is not simply
to say stop doing it. The appropriate response, wherever it is possi-
ble, is to say undo it. That is a judicial obligation to make good on
the 14th amendment.

  And as I said a moment ago, one of the developments in Ameri-
can constitutional law which is at the stage, I would say, of explo-
ration now is the development about the particular power of Con-
gress to address a general societal discrimination as opposed to a
specific remedy for a specific discrimination. That is a concern
which will be played out in constitutional litigation for some time
ahead of us.

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, may I interrupt for the purpose of
clarification?

  Senator SIMON. I would yield to the chairman at all times.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, when you say specific remedy for a specif-
ic situation, do you mean specific remedy for a specific individual,
or do you mean specific remedy for a specific situation?
  Judge SOUTER. Identifiable class within a situation, yes.
  Senator SIMON. Societal.
  The CHAIRMAN. An identifiable class.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. I think the difficulty that you have--and I
mean you and I will have it here--in talking in the abstract is to
say, well, how far do you go when you are imposed a judicial
remedy.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not asking you that.
  Judge SOUTER. NO, I was just going to say how far you go to the
point where you carry yourself across the line from a remedial
order to an order which addresses a societal and not a remedial
problem. And I don't know how you draw that line in the abstract,
but you have to be conscious that you should not be either too shy
or too bold in the use of the judicial power.
  The CHAIRMAN. TO put it in layman's terms, the debate among
those on the court and constitutional scholars is whether or not
you can remedy a situation for a specific individual, where that in-
dividual has to show I have been discriminated against, as opposed
to I am part of a class of people that have been discriminated
against. That is the debate, at least in part, that is taking place.
And when you said specific remedy, I wasn't sure whether you
were talking about the individual as you were describing this
debate that is taking place right now. So you are not merely limit-
ing the need for government to respond to stop, but as well as
undo, to the case where a specific individual is asserting they were
a victim of a specific act of prejudice that is outlawed. But you
were talking about more broadly. Is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. That is right. I think no such abstract line can be
recognized. There are going to be some cases in which the only
thing that is going to be proven is going to be a specific act of dis-
crimination. There are going to be other cases, in fact, in what is
                                      184
proven is, in fact, a far broader but proven discrimination. And the
remedy must be tailored to the proof.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge. I appreciate it.
  Senator SIMON. Let me, if I may, rephrase where I think we are
going. First of all, while the word "quota" wasn't used, clearly that
is not a desirable thing in our society. And we don't want that; the
Court doesn't want that.
  When you say "undo," sometimes that is not enough. Congress
says we have some residual problems from the days of slavery,
from other problems that have existed because of discrimination
against African-Americans, Hispanics, women, and others. And so
Congress takes affirmative action to say we ought to be encourag-
ing--in a constructive way--a more open society where opportuni-
ties are here forever.
  Without being specific, do those affirmative actions that Con-
gress would take in any way leave you with a feeling of unease?
  Judge SOUTER. No, it leaves me with a feeling that we are on the
verge of developing law, rather than in a situation in which we can
say with clarity that the law has developed and we know what its
limits are going to be.
  When we address the kind of issue that you raise, Senator, we
immediately go back to the Fullilove case, in which the Court
found that it did indeed pass muster under the congressional power
to set-aside, I believe it was a 10-percent minority set-aside in that
case.
  There is certainly one reading of the recent Metro Broadcasting
case, in which the Court upheld a--I forget the precise articulation
of it, but upheld the use of giving some extra credit to a minority
application subject to the FCC, simply by virtue of its minority
origin, and approved the use of restricting for sales in those cases
to minority buyers.
  On the other side of the scale, we know that there is less flexibil-
ity available to the State and local governments to do that kind of
tailoring to broader societal discrimination, and I think, without
question, one of the most significant subjects which is going to be
developed in the Court in the foreseeable future is a more precise
definition of just what the congressional power is, whether it be
under section 5 of the 14th amendment or under Congress' article I
power.
  Senator SIMON. And section 5 is a fairly sweeping kind of author-
ization.
  Judge SOUTER. It was unprecedented, as you know, at the time it
was passed.
  Senator SIMON. Finally, just a suggestion that I am going to pass
along to you. Growth is one of the things I talked about in my
opening remarks. I think it is very important for Senators, I think
it is very important for Justices on the Court, to be exposed to
things in our society that maybe we have not been exposed to.
  If I can use a personal illustration, we do not have any Indian
reservations in Illinois. I know there are serious problems and,
while we have some native Americans in the city of Chicago, reac-
tively it is a handful of people.
  I took the time to go to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in
South Dakota and found 73 percent unemployment, 65 percent of
                                      185
the homes with no telephones, 26 percent of the homes with no
indoor plumbing, and 8 percent of the homes with no electricity.

  Now when an issue about American Indians comes up, it is not
an abstraction for me. You know, I think this good, great, rich
country ought to be doing better. I do not mean this disrespectfully
to your fine background, but I want you to understand perhaps a
little more than you now do some of the aches of America.

  If you were to get together--and I prefer you to not answer right
now, but maybe you will want to respond in the second round, with
your friend and mine Warren Rudman, maybe Fred McClure, who
was here just a little bit ago, and think about some kind of an
agenda, when the Court is not in session, where you would get to
understand the west side of Chicago, or perhaps an Indian reserva-
tion. I am not going to spell out that agenda. But I think if that
were to take place, you would be a better U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tice.

  Justice Cardozo has been quoted here this morning. Let me just
give you a quote here: "Where does the judge turn for the knowl-
edge that is needed to weigh the social interests that shape the
law? I can only answer that he must get his knowledge from expe-
rience and study and reflection, in brief, in life itself."

  When we get to this second round, I would like any reflections
you might have on how David Souter is going to grow, as a Justice,
not just sitting on the Court. I think your experience with that
young couple at Harvard was a growing experience. I think your
being on the hospital board was a growing experience. And when I
talk about growing, I think of Justice Hugo Black, who started off
as a Ku Klux Klan member, and ended up as one of the great
champions of civil liberties.

  Anyway, you have my suggestion and I look forward to asking
you for any reflections, when we get to the second round.

  Thank you, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kohl.
  Senator KOHL. Well, I am the last questioner before lunch. Judge
Souter, can I order you lunch?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, if it is all the same to you, I would
rather take the questions and we will have lunch after. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMON. He has heard how parsimonious you are on
buying lunch. [Laughter.]
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Souter, why do you want this job?
  Judge SOUTER. I did not seek this job, as you know. I was asked
by the President of the United States to do this. What I said to you
yesterday afternoon is my answer to that question. If I am con-
firmed in this office, I will be given the greatest power that anyone
in the judiciary of the United States can ever know, and that is, as
I said, the power to preserve and to protect.
  With it, as with all power, goes a like degree of responsibility,
and if I am confirmed in this office, I want to try the best that I
can to exercise that responsibility, to give the Constitution a good
life in the time that its interpretation will be entrusted to me, to
preserve that life and to preserve it for the generations that will be
sitting perhaps in this room after you and I are long gone from it.
                                      186
  Senator KOHL. SO, this is a job, even though you were not seek-
ing it, that you very much want?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator KOHL. For the reasons that you have just expressed?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator KOHL. YOU will be replacing, as we all know, Justice
Brennan. Would you say, in a general way, that you are similar,
dissimilar, vastly dissimilar? And how do you think he is going to
be remembered and if you would wish to surmise, do you hope you
will be remembered?
  Judge SOUTER. I will be candid with you, Senator. That last part
of the question, I would not be presumptuous enough to answer.
We will have to wait and see. But I know how Justice Brennan is
going to be remembered. It has nothing to do with Justice Bren-
nan's philosophical position, it has nothing to do with any distinc-
tion that may or may not be drawn between him and me. I am not
going to draw such a distinction.
  Justice Brennan is going to be remembered as one of the most
fearlessly principled guardians of the American Constitution that
it has ever had and ever will have. No one following Justice Bren-
nan, absolutely no one could possibly say a word to put himself in
the league with Justice Brennan. All you can do is to say what per-
haps once Justice Brennan said, "I will do the best I can."
  Senator KOHL. Judge Souter, you have got a reputation, well-de-
served, as a fine writer, and you are a scholar. Usually, those quali-
ties in a person of your kind do result in some substantial writing,
and there is not any substantial writing that I am aware of that
you have done. Would you care to comment on that?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, there are the 200-and-some-odd opinions
which have represented a great deal of substantial writing to me,
and I will not ask you to read all of those 220-odd opinions.
  Senator KOHL. I was referring to public
  Judge SOUTER. That is right. No, in point of fact, I guess there
have been two things that have motivated me. One, I describe I
guess with caution, but in a fine kind of way they go to what Sena-
tor Simon was speaking of a moment ago.
  I have loved the judiciary. I have been a trial judge, I have been
an appellate judge, and I want to be nothing else. As the years
have gone, I have found that my judging has become more all-con-
suming of me than I once thought it was going to be.
  In earlier days, including the days when I was on the trial court
and, in fact, before I went on the bench, when I was in public law
practice, but still practicing law, one of the things that I wanted to
do with my time was to do something other than as a lawyer, and
that is why I served on boards and I had experiences, which Sena-
tor Simon was right in saying, that changed me. They made me
grow.
  Beyond that, I will admit that there have been some times when
I have been tempted to write on things that concern me profession-
ally very much, and I was once even given almost a cart blanche
for a book publication, if I would write something. I have not done
it or I did not do it in those instances, because the things that I
would have wanted to write about most were the things that were
coming before me, as a judge, and, frankly, I was afraid that if I
                                      187

started writing too much, I was going to end up recusing myself too
much, because, as I envisioned what I might have written, it would
have been difficult to get into it without starting to take positions
and do just what I should not have done.

  There are many judges who have handled the business of writing
with great subtlety and they have managed to come up with ex-
traordinary outputs, without compromising themselves in what
they did on the bench.

  The thing in several instances that I would like to have written
about I think probably would have either forced me into writing
just generality, or into writing things that really would have start-
ed disqualifying me, and I chose not to do it.

  Senator KOHL. Yesterday, when the protestors did their act, ev-
erybody in the room, of course, was startled and turned around or
looked ahead to see what was happening, with one exception--you.

  Judge SOUTER. Oh, I turned around.
  Senator KOHL. Did you?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator KOHL. OK. I had not noticed that.
  Judge SOUTER. Actually, I had some practice for this. I remember
that something very similar happened during one of Governor Sun-
unu's inaugurations, and there was a sense of deja vu to the whole
experience. No, I turned around.
  Senator KOHL. In connection with preparation for this hearing, it
is our understanding that you have spent 4 or 5 weeks studying
very hard to ready yourself for this hearing. You have had meet-
ings and briefing books, and I am sure you have gotten a lot of
advice. There are a couple of questions that I would like to ask
about that.
  Did members of the administration help you prepare for this
hearing?
  Judge SOUTER. Only in the sense of doing things that I asked to
have done. There have been some lawyers, as you know, from the
White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department who
have been there to help me. But the ground rules were at the be-
ginning--and they were, in fact, not ground rules that I even had
to impose, I mean they were ground rules that were offered and
they were the only appropriate ones--were that they would pull to-
gether material that I wanted to review. As you can imagine, I
have been revisiting a lot of cases, some of which I have read
almost on a daily basis certain times in my life and some of which
I have not read for a long time.
  So, what was agreed upon at the beginning of the process was
that we would work together on a suggested topic list. All nomi-
nees, obviously, are going to review certain subjects, so they had a
topic list much in mind. We discussed it I think the first week of
the nomination, and they then collected the kinds of material that
I wanted to do my reading.
  There have not been the kinds of briefings in the sense of saying,
"Judge, this is the law or this is an appropriate position that you
ought to maintain the hearings." There has been a very scrupulous
regard for the fact that I am the nominee, and not the administra-
tion.
                                      188

   Senator KOHL. Well, there are, I believe, four members of the ad-
ministration sitting right behind you.

  Judge SOUTER. That sounds like the right count, yes.
  Senator KOHL. And my question is, in terms of the future, in
view of the fact that the administration comes to argue in court--
and obviously the most disinterested attitude is the one that we
need to have--do you think that we could sharpen up that process
in the future, to create a larger, a bigger distance from day one,
once a person gets nominated, a more independent distance than is
what is normal, apparently, in the process, as I understand it?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I
  Senator KOHL. Again, as a person sitting here for the first time, I
just get the feeling--and I do not believe you are the kind of a man
who would let it happen--that there is too close a relationship
here.
  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate exactly the issue that you are raising
and I think it is good to raise it. I suppose there is no question,
that Congress could sort of create an office of legal adjunct to
nominees to try to provide the help that we need, and we do need
help. I mean I wanted to do a great deal of reading and rereading,
as I said, in the time prior to these hearings. One of the things I
know is that I could not very efficiently have spent my time alone
pulling all the material together in a very usable way. I would
have spent a good deal of time just running back and forth be-
tween stacks and libraries, so that at least a candidate or a nomi-
nee who wanted to approach the hearings as I did, would need
some help.
  It might be difficult, given the pace of Supreme Court nomina-
tions, to make that a very workable proposition. I must say I tend
to analogize as closely as I can the role of the people who have
helped me in a way, to the people whom I am very used to having
help me, and that is the law clerks that I have on the court.
  The role which the Justice Department and White House law-
yers have played for me has, in fact, been a far less intellectually
close one than the role that a judge and his law clerk plays. For
example, one of the things that I want my law clerks to do is to
argue me out of a position, if they think I am taking the wrong
one. So there is a very intense kind of intellectual interchange that
goes on or one hopes will go on between judge and clerk.
  Yet, when that clerkship is over, that does not--and I think is
not thought by anybody--to taint the possibility that some day that
clerk can appear before the judge in court. My own personal rule
has been, although I never formalized it, that I would not hear a
law clerk's argument for at least a year had gone, and so
  Senator KOHL. What I was looking for an answer to is the ques-
tion, do you think in the future our country would be well advised,
from the moment a person is nominated, to create the same dis-
tance between the nominee and the administration, as exists be-
tween the nominee and Congress, or any other party, for that
matter? Why should there be a closer relationship, as there is obvi-
ously today? I mean it is clear. It seems to me that your independ-
ence, as a Supreme Court Justice, is more clearly apparent, if you
are here today without their company.
                                      189
  Judge SOUTER. I see the point that you are making. I am glad to
have the opportunity to say that nobody has been subtly or other-
wise lobbying me on a particular position.
  Senator KOHL. I believe it.
  Judge SOUTER. There is no question, a nominee needs help.
  Senator KOHL. He also needs independence.
  Judge SOUTER. YOU are absolutely right and, fortunately, these
people have given it to me.
  Senator KOHL. I understand, yes.
  Just a couple of questions on Roe v. Wade. In 1973, when it was
promulgated, you were in the AG's office
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator KOHL [continuing]. And it is hard to go back to what you
did that day or in the days and weeks after, but I am just presum-
ing that there was conversation between you and your colleagues
at that time. Do you recall your feelings about Roe v. Wade back
when it was promulgated?
  Judge SOUTER. I frankly do not remember the early discussions
on it. I mean everybody was arguing it. It was probably fodder for
more argument among lawyers than any other case, certainly, of
its time. The only thing I specifically remember is I can remember
not only I, but others whom I knew, really switching back and
forth playing devil's advocate on Roe v. Wade.
  Senator KOHL. YOU had no opinion about it, other than just to
say "wow"?
  Judge SOUTER. Oh, I doubtless had an opinion. No, I did not just
say "wow."
  Senator KOHL. What was your opinion in 1973 on Roe v. Wade?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, with respect, Senator, I am going to ask you
to let me draw the line there, because I do not think I could get
into opinions of 1973, without there being taken indications of opin-
ions in 1976.
  Senator KOHL. OK. With respect, finally, to Roe v. Wade just
once more, is it fair to state, even though you are not prepared to
discuss it, understandably, that you do have an opinion on Roe v.
Wade?
  Judge SOUTER. I think it would be misleading to say that. I have
not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe v. Wade, if
that case were brought before me. I will listen to both sides of that
case. I have not made up my mind and I do not go on the Court
saying I must go one way or I must go another way.
  As you know, the issue that arises when an established and exist-
ing precedent is attacked is a very complex issue. It involves not
only the correctness or the incorrectness by whatever lights we
judge it of a given decision. It can also involve extremely signifi-
cant issues of precedent.
  Senator KOHL. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. And I do not sit here before you, under oath,
having any commitment in my mind as to what I would do if I
were on that Court and that case were brought before me.
  Senator KOHL. Well, I think that is a significant statement.
  I would just like to ask you for a moment about cameras in the
court. How do you feel about cameras in the Federal court? How do
you feel about cameras in the Supreme Court?
                                      190

  Judge SOUTER. Actually, I have never seen a camera in a Federal
court. As you know, I have been a Federal judge for a comparative-
ly short period of time and, as a result of what happened to me last
July, my judicial experience on the Federal bench has been cut
very short.

  The only experience that I have had were with cameras in the
New Hampshire Supreme Court, where they are allowed, as long
as they are not obtrusive. The experience there was that, after the
rule was passed allowing the cameras in, for a period of time there
was a spate of great interest in taking photographs in the court-
room, and, you know, any case that rose in interest to sort of 5 on
a scale of 10 would carry with it video cameras in the back of the
courtroom and so on. That lasted for about 2 years, and I am sorry
to say that apparently the news media or the New Hampshire
public at that point grew so bored with what they were seeing pho-
tographed, that people stopped taking pictures and we have not
seen them for very long.

  I do not know whether, if this hearing went on for 2 years, the
photographers would all clear out or not, but that was the New
Hampshire experience.

  Senator LEAHY. DO not do that to us, Judge. [Laughter.]
  Senator KOHL. HOW about 2 more days? So, cameras in the Fed-
eral court, in your mind you have some ambivalent feelings about
it, or do you feel it might be
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I am of two minds, in one respect. The fact
is, if the cameras are unobtrusive and they are not making, you
know, sound that is distracting, that is one thing. There is still a
risk there, and I will get to it. Cameras which are obtrusive in the
course of oral argument, so that they really do tend to distract
your attention, I think is something that has got to be avoided.
  When I am sitting there on a bench, you now, I am very much in
the position that the members of this committee are, except that I
am in an even tougher one. Several of you have said to me, well,
after you leave here, if the Senate confirms you, we will never see
you again. You have at least got a few days' worth and you can
decide how long it is going to be that you do see me.
  When I am sitting as a judge, I am seeing or I am hearing the
sides of the case for 20 minutes or half an hour or whatever the
case may be. It is a short period of time and I do not want distrac-
tion from that case. So, that is why a clicking camera can be diffi-
cult in a situation like that. [Laughter.]
  That seems to have provoked a great deal of clicking. [Laughter.]
  I think I need say no more. [Laughter.]
  Senator KOHL. The last question on that is the educational value
of cameras in the court, particularly oral arguments at the Su-
preme Court level--aside from its distraction, there is truly some
value. I must say that even before I came to the Senate, I have
learned an awful lot through C-Span, and I think that one of the
best things we do in this country is to make C-Span one of our
prime-time stations. While it is not exactly comparable, bringing
the court into the home has some value for children and for adults.
Now, I don't know whether it is counterbalanced by your own feel-
ings in terms of the distraction, but I think you would agree with
                                         191

that, would you not, there is some value in bringing the courts into
our home?

  Judge SOUTER. There is no question that there is as value there.
  Senator KOHL. The last area: Going back to when you were attor-
ney general in New Hampshire, you have been asked many ques-
tions about your time and conduct as the attorney general and you
have responded, in part, by saying "that was then and this is now,"
which seems to imply that you feel that there is some sort of a
change which has taken place in you between then and now, which
would not be unusual. It happens to all people.
  So let me ask you what you would do today, Judge Souter, if you
were attorney general and you were asked by the Governor to
make the same arguments you made then about ethnic statistics,
flag lowering, literacy, or even the license plate case, would you do
it?
  Judge SOUTER. The big difference, you see, is you are rightly
keeping me in the role of the lawyer and the advocate. The big dif-
ference is that, on those issues, we have got a lot of law today that
we did not have then. Just take literacy, for example. At the time
Attorney General Rudman and I were engaged in the literacy test
case, Oregon v. Mitchell had not come down. Oregon v. Mitchell was
decided, as I think I said yesterday, perhaps 4 months, 6 months
after we argued that case. So, there were arguments which were
there to be made then and they are not there to be made now.
  As I said earlier this morning, the virtue of the system and one
of the very responsibilities of the lawyer, as advocate, is to fight
out the constitutional issues in a sufficiently illuminating way, to
give the courts the help that they need from the adversary process
to sharpen those issues and get them right.
  So the fact is, I would not be making the same arguments today,
but we would not be having the same cases today, either.
  Senator KOHL. OK. I respect your answer and I guess I will ask
once more, to see if there is some opening of a door, at least this
wide, and not certainly good or bad, but just some. I thought you
said and I thought I had seen a person today who was not the same
person that he was 15 years ago, as none of us are. Hopefully, we
all grow, develop, change, mature, get better as we go on in our
life. Certainly in our profession we mature, and I still--I want to
say that I believe that the man who is sitting here today would
have a harder time--if not refuse--defending those cases as the at-
torney general 15 years ago. I want to believe that, so maybe that
is how I will end my own personal questioning of you.

  Judge SOUTER. I am content to have you end it there, sir. Thank
you. [Laughter.]

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Just one clarification. In response to Senator
Kohl, who asked you about your writing, you said that you wrote
220, and I quote you exactly, "wrote 220-odd opinions." You may
want to clarify that just a little. [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. Could I strike one word?
  Senator SIMON. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. YOU know which one. [Laughter.]
  Thank you, Senator.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, the press will immediately go out and
assess whether you did poorly or well today. I think you did well,
but they will also have to assess that the networks obviously did
not do well today, based on the discussion here that has been
raised, and so maybe they will have a better afternoon.

  Judge, we will recess for lunch until 3 o'clock. Let us start
promptly at 3 o'clock, and we will have three, I believe, possibly
four questioners, but no more than that, and we will end for the
weekend after that. Is that all right?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. We will recess.
  [Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m., the committee was in recess, to recon-
vene at 3 p.m., the same day.]

                                           AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. Welcome back,
Judge. As I said, I think the extent to which we are going to go this
afternoon is the three persons you see here in front of you at this
very moment. There are four, but three of us will ask our questions
this afternoon, and then we will adjourn for the weekend and give
you an opportunity to do something other than to sit there in that
chair. Although as I said to someone who asked me earlier one of
my staff people, they said, boy, he sure is good--I mean he can sit
there. I said, look, that is what judges are supposed to do.

  You have a lot of practice at doing it. But I really seriously
admire your constitution, and we are not going to trespass on it,
test it too much this afternoon.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, as it will come as no surprise to you, I
would like, as I said yesterday, to pick up where you and I left off
yesterday. Yesterday, you told me that almost anything can be a
liberty interest recognized, at least to some extent, by the Constitu-
tion.
  Now, you refer to "whole range of human interests and activi-
ties" within the ambit of the liberty clause. That comes from yes-
terday's transcript, on page 118.
  In the broadest context, for example, chewing gum is a liberty
interest, or firing a gun can be a liberty interest, or smoking ciga-
rettes can be a liberty interest. But the key question is, in these
instances and all others, is, can the State interpose itself between
the individual and the liberty interest that individual is seeking to
exercise?
  The State can take away your liberty interest in smoking in
public, for example, because it decides that smoke from cigarettes
is harmful to the health of other people. The State can take away
your liberty interest in firing a gun if, in doing so, you are firing
that gun at somebody else.
  Now, the Supreme Court has historically dealt with this issue,
the question of when a State can interpose itself between the indi-
vidual and the liberty interest the individual wants to exercise,
first by asking whether that liberty interest is a fundamental inter-
est or an ordinary interest.
                                      193
  Now, yesterday you said the right of marital privacy "can and
should be regarded as fundamental", to use your words. And you
said, "the concept of an enforceable marital right to privacy would
give it fundamental importance."
  Now, that means, Judge, as I understand you, that a woman has
a fundamental right to use contraceptives, to decide whether or not
she wishes, in the first instance, to become pregnant. I think that
nearly everyone agrees with that proposition, with notable excep-
tions.
  Now, my question is this, Judge. If the liberty interest in choos-
ing whether or not to become--for a married woman, so that we
don't get off into a debate about Eisenstadt--if the liberty interest
in choosing whether or not to become pregnant in the first instance
is a fundamental liberty interest, fundamental right of privacy, is
that liberty interest terminated when a woman becomes pregnant?
  Judge SOUTER. Mr. Chairman, I think there are two questions in
your question. First, is the interest that the woman would assert
following pregnancy a liberty interest? Second, having asserted
that, what weight should be given to it? Should it be given the
same constitutional weight as the liberty interest which she asserts
prior to pregnancy?
  With respect to the first question, the answer is undoubtedly yes.
I think that going back to an exchange you and I had yesterday, I
think you alluded to that. There are the Supreme Court reports,
including dissenting and concurring opinions, that are replete with
references to the fact in just such contexts as this that liberty is
not limited to locomotion. That is, that is exactly the sense that
you have been explaining this afternoon. So, of course, it would be
asserted as a liberty interest.
  The second question, how should that liberty interest be valued,
is one of the central questions in the Roe v. Wade debate. And with
respect to that, for reasons that I mentioned yesterday, I think that
is the point at which I must respectfully draw the line.
  I wonder if I may ask you one thing, and if this is out of turn,
you tell me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Nothing is out of turn. As we said at the outset
any question is appropriate.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, in fact, that is one difference between my
role here before this committee and my role as a judge. I can't ask
questions here.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you can, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I just did. In any case, thank you.
  I remember when this first came up when you and I were speak-
ing yesterday afternoon, and I said you understand my position. I
thought afterwards I am not sure that everyone does. Would it be
out of turn for me to take a minute for me to explain why I feel
that I have to take that position?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO. It wouldn't. As long as, Judge, you don't
take all of the half hour to prevent me from getting to what I
would like to go to next. If you take a few minutes, I would be de-
lighted to hear it; otherwise, I would suggest that you wait until
the end of my questioning to do it. You decide.
  Judge SOUTER. I promise you this is not a New Hampshire ruse. I
say that because there are a number of people watching what we
                                      194
are doing today who have not heard an explanation from me, and I
think they ought to have one.

  I have alluded to the reason a number of times. Ultimately it
goes to the fact, as we did say yesterday, that the continuing validi-
ty of Roe v. Wade is an issue which will come before the Court, and
if I shall be confirmed it will come before me.

  The reason it is inappropriate for someone in my position to ex-
press an opinion on an issue which would be comprehended by that
request to overrule Roe v. Wade goes right to the heart of what the
judicial process is.

  And if the judicial process is nothing else, it is a process in which
in every court and on every issue that may come before a judge the
people who come before him can have a fair hearing. A fair hear-
ing means something substantially more than simply judicial cour-
tesy to sit back and let a person say whatever is in that person's
mind. A fair hearing requires a willingness of the court not only to
listen, but genuinely to examine the position which the court is in-
clined at that point to take.

  Anything which substantially could inhibit the court's capacity
to listen truly and to listen with as open a mind as it is humanly
possible to have should be off-limits to a judge. Why this kind of
discussion would take me down a road which I think it would be
unethical for me to follow is something that perhaps I can suggest
and I will close with this question.

  Is there anyone who has not, at some point, made up his mind on
some subject and then later found reason to change or modify it?
No one has failed to have that experience.

  No one has also failed to know that it is much easier to modify
an opinion if one has not already stated it convincingly to someone
else.

  With that in mind, can you imagine the pressure that would be
on a judge who had stated an opinion, or seemed to have given a
commitment in these circumstances to the Senate of the United
States, and for all practical purposes, to the American people?

  You understand the compromise that that would place upon the
judicial capacity and that is my reason for having to draw the line.
I thank you for the time to say it.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is extremely well stated, if that is what I
was asking you to do.

  You used several phrases in your comments you just made. You
said, "substantially limit." What I am asking you does not, in my
view--and let me explain why--"substantially limit" your ability
to sit before any group of litigants and have a totally open mind, or
a mind that although already inclined to rule one way, is open
enough to listen intently, honestly, and with great interest to why
the position you have tentatively taken in your mind should not be
retained by you.

  There are two parts, if I may respectfully suggest, Judge, to the
equation in determining whether or not you would rule one way or
another on any case relating to reproductive freedom.

  One part is the value placed upon the liberty interest that is re-
tained and constitutionally protected by the Court, recognized by
the Court. The second is what the Court would conclude to be suffi-
cient evidence to meet the test required under the law, to provide
                                      195
countervailing weight to interpose the State between the woman
and that right.

  There are two sides to the equation, Judge. You can never solve
a problem without both sides of the equation being present. If I
only ask you for one side of the equation, you may think it takes
you down a road, but no reasonable person, in my opinion, can con-
clude and walk out of this room with any clear notion of how you
would rule only knowing the one side.

  Let me be more specific, because I, too, am asked--a lot of people
probably don't understand why I am. There are those out there
who don't understand, why you are unwilling to answer. There are
probably as equally as many people who don't understand why is
Biden persisting in asking, if it is not for the purpose of finding out
what this Judge is going to rule when the next case relative to the
issue of reproductive freedom comes up.

  Let me explain my side of that for a moment if I may. As I said,
the first part of this question is to determine how Judge Souter
thinks. What methodology Judge Souter would employ or be in-
clined to employ, even though, even that he can change his mind.
No one here--let me say it for the fifth time, or sixth or seventh--
no one here is seeking a commitment on anything. And nothing
that you say here, today, on any subject, precludes you from doing
what my friend from Iowa said the other day, when he said, I had
a totally different view today about what is appropriate to ask and
what isn't appropriate to ask. He changed his mind. He has a right
to change his mind.

  So no one is asking you for a commitment. Now, Judge, it seems
to me that if you are willing to discuss with us, with me, the first
part of the equation, whether or not this fundamental right of pri-
vacy of a married woman regarding procreation, regarding whether
or not she wishes to be a mother, ceases at the time she becomes
pregnant, or continues for some period of time, you have not an-
swered in any way how you would rule on Roe v. Wade because if
there is a fundamental right that exists, the State must have an
extraordinary reason to interpose itself between the mother's judg-
ment and her state of pregnancy or nonpregnancy.

  What you consider to be an overwhelming reason is something I
am not asking you. For you, an overwhelming reason could be
there are just too many people or not enough people in the work
force, that America's population is declining and the State has an
interest in seeing to it that the birthrate is up, not down.

  For you that could be an overwhelming reason. For you the fact
that it is arguable that it is a fetus, that is able to be sustained
outside the womb might not be an overwhelming reason. We don't
know. I don't know. No one knows.

  I am not asking you that. I'm not going to ask you that. But it
seems to me that it is not at all inappropriate for me to ask you,
how do you think as a constitutional lawyer and soon-to-be Su-
preme Court Justice about weighing the values that you spoke of
yesterday.

  Judge SOUTER. The answer to that question is two-fold, I guess.
We think about that process of weighing values in essentially the
same way and essentially by the same principles that we go about
weighing values in the liberty case with which you and I began,
                                      196
the circumstances prior to conception. We go about it in exactly
the same way we go about assessing the value of any liberty inter-
est.

  As I have explained, basically my approach to it is the approach
of Mr. Justice Harlan. The point at which I think you and I re-
spectfully have to part company is on this point. You are saying to
me that I am not, if I were to answer your second question, I am
not in any way saying how I would rule.

  With respect, I think I am a third to a half of the way down the
road to saying how I would rule. Because as you say, there are a
number of components in that ruling.

  The CHAIRMAN. Can I interrupt you there, just so that we keep
this as a little bit of a conversation? If I get in my automobile and I
start in the westerly direction but there are three forks in the road
between where I start and where Roe lives, and I get one-third the
way down the road, and I stay on the road. I don't take the fork
that leads me away from Roe, does that in any way tell you that I
am going to end up at Roe's house?

  Judge SOUTER. No, sir, it doesn't. But the road between here and
Roe's house does not have 3 forks, it has 3 miles. It has

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW many forks does it have, Judge
  Judge SOUTER. Pardon me?
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. To keep this silly metaphor
  Judge SOUTER. I don't think it is a forked road. I think we have
to cross certain territories, if you will, of subject matter. We have
to cross the issue of how the interest is itself valued. We have to
cross the territory in which we explore what the countervailing in-
terest may be and how they are to be valued. And in a case of re-
examining a prior precedent we have to cross the territory of valu-
ing that precedent in accordance with the general rules that we
have.
  You are saying to me and I respect the position from which you
say it, sir, that I want you to cover the first third of the journey
because that still leaves two-thirds of the way and you may or may
not travel those two-thirds if you are asked to do it.
  And my response has to be when I travel the first third, I am
giving a third of an indication of what would be done, and with re-
spect, I think I cannot do it.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU and I took different logic courses, Judge,
and with all due respect on this one, it is probably the only thing I
might get a better mark than you on. Because to suggest that to go
one-third of the way in any way tells you where you are going to
end, it diminishes the probabilities that I may not end, but it does
not tell you.
  But let me get off of this for a minute, because there is probably
no course that I could think of that I would have done better than
you in law school.
  Judge SOUTER. I will drop my analogy if you will.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me explain, or use another analogy.
  There was a good deal of discussion yesterday between you and
Senator Kennedy and between you and, I believe it was Senator
DeConcini--let me check, yes--and between you and me, less with
me, and more with those other two gentlemen, about the equal pro-
tection clause as it applies against women.
                                      197
  Now, you discussed at length the various levels of scrutiny that
are used in evaluating claims of gender discrimination. You talked
about three standards of review that the Court uses when it looks
at laws that classified people on the basis of whether or not they
are male or female.
  You said that strict scrutiny is the toughest standard. You said
there is a rational basis test. You explained that. Then you said
that there is a third test. There is the in-between--I am not quot-
ing you--there is the in-between level of scrutiny which the law-
yers call intermediate level of scrutiny and/or the middle tier in
which one of the Justices on the Court calls God knows what.
  Now, you came along at the end of that, I was kind of interested
that you were willing to go so far the down the road to Mary's
house. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU got down the road and you said, yesterday--
I looked at you and I said to you, now, let me understand, Judge. I
said, well, let me understand, Judge, "there is a standard between
strict scrutiny and rational basis? Is that where you are?"
  And you said, "Well, I suppose there has got to be." Then you
certainly said the same thing in response to Senator DeConcini,
when you said, "I am certainly satisfied that it would be too blunt
a set of instruments just to have one test at the bottom and one
test, if you will at the top."
  Now, in the area of equal protection, you are willing to tell me
what ball park you are in. You crossed a lot more fields than you
are willing to cross with me on the issues of procreation. How can
you intellectually justify telling me what test you will use relative
to the equal protection clause, and not tell me what test or princi-
ples you will use relative to the issues relating to procreation?
  Judge SOUTER. Because there is no serious possibility, I think,
today that anyone would maintain before a court, in the history of
equal protection development that we have had in this country,
that the only two focuses of equal protection have got to be at the
one end least scrutiny of all, at the other end greatest scrutiny of
all, as in the scrutiny for fundamental rights.
  There may be disagreement within this committee, there may be
disagreement within the court among lawyers as to how to articu-
late the way that we travel that distance between the least and the
most scrutiny. But I think it is fair to say that there is no question
today of anyone seriously arguing that there are not interests
which are important enough to transcend the least scrutiny and
which may not be important enough to get to the greatest. And my
concern in the discussion, as you know, has been that the real
tough question is whether the test for that place in between, if we
are going to have discrete spots on the spectrum, should be the one
that we have or a different test, if we could devise one.
  The CHAIRMAN. But you think it is in between. You told us you
think it should be in between. Judge, I think you are making a dis-
tinction without a difference. And with all due respect, the fact is
that there are a number of gender discrimination cases you are
going to have to deal with before this century is over. There are a
number of issues you are going to have to confront. And you appro-
priately, not inappropriately, have told this body and the Nation
that you have arrived at a standard that you would apply. You
                                      198
said, "I haven't written it out yet." The fact that you reject the
bottom one, Judge, and say everybody else rejects it does not speak
to the question that there are two left. And you have chosen one of
the two.

  Judge SOUTER. Sir, I have not chosen the articulation of the
middle-tier standard. I am saying that that is the one we have got
now, and we ought to see if we can do a better job in articulating
it.

  The CHAIRMAN. A middle-tier standard.
  Judge SOUTER. The position that I have taken--and I would have
thought, and I do think that it would be unreasonable to take any
other position--is that
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, why is it unreasonable to take the
strict scrutiny position? Why is that unreasonable?
  Judge SOUTER. I have not taken a position that it is unreason-
able. What I am saying is that it would be unreasonable to take
the position that the interest in avoiding discrimination on grounds
of sex is of such obvious unimportance that you could seriously
argue at this point that it should be left to the minimum scrutiny.
  As to whether or not a sexual classification should be judged on
the basis of the very highest scrutiny or not is a subject upon
which I have not taken a position. I think the two things that I
have said is clearly we must recognize that it is more important
than minimum scrutiny. And if we are trying to devise a test for a
middle tier, I am concerned, as I have said before, about the flexi-
ble quality of the one that we have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, this is not a--I'm trying to find out
information and rationales. I am not trying to bait you.
  Let me ask you, then, from my perspective sitting here, it
seemed to me that gender was not the only area you were able--
you were willing, at least, and you acknowledge you narrowed the
field. And you say the reason you are able to narrow it on gender,
basically to translate what you said, the way I understand it, is be-
cause there is no longer any real debate about the lowest standard
so it is all right to basically say there has got to be something other
than the lower standard.
  Judge SOUTER. I don't think there is a reasonable debate.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, right. OK.
  Now, in the morning, you had an exchange with Senator Specter.
You were talking about the free exercise clause of the first amend-
ment, the clause that protects a citizen's right to exercise their per-
sonal religion free from undue Government interference and apply-
ing the free exercise clause in particular cases requires the same
kind of reasoning as is involved in the unenumerated rights area,
like the right of privacy and the right of a woman to remain preg-
nant or not to remain pregnant, according to her choosing.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, it involves the same level of scrutiny if a
classification
  The CHAIRMAN. Right, that is all I am talking about. That is all I
am talking about.
  Now, in all these cases, Judge, the judge has to decide "how the
individual interest should be evaluated and the weight that should
be given to it in determining whether there is in any or all circum-
stances a sufficiently countervailing governmental interest." Now,
                                      199
those are your words from yesterday, Judge, in describing what you
would not be willing to tell us concerning a woman's right, when
you were speaking of the woman's right. Yet in the free exercise
case, you told Senator Specter that you recognized the value of the
"strict scrutiny standard." You said that a person's right to exer-
cise his or her freedom of religion is fundamental, and that to over-
come it the State must have a compelling interest and a statute
must be narrowly tailored to that interest.

  In other words, you told him about free exercise exactly what
you are unwilling to tell me about procreation.

  Judge SOUTER. I think what I told Senator Specter was, No. 1,
that the test as you have just quoted me as saying was the Su-
preme Court's test for it. And I told Senator Specter that there was
nothing in my experience which had led me to believe that I would
wish to re-examine that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, now, what does that mean? Isn't that the
same thing as saying that in your experience you are satisfied with
the strict scrutiny test? Isn't that what you just told us?

  Judge SOUTER. I am saying that there is no basis that I would
raise in the discussion with Senator Specter or anyone else on this
committee to give them an indication that I think there should be
a change in the test that the Court has had. I also said to Senator
Specter, when we were describing, for example, the concept of es-
tablishment, that I had not done any research or taken any posi-
tion on the question of re-examining the concept of establishment.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that.
  Judge SOUTER. And I said to him then and I would now that if a
case of that sort were brought and the argument were made, I
would listen. But I do not approach those issues with any precon-
ception that I
  The CHAIRMAN. In the establishment area, that is true, Judge, if
I may interrupt you. But on the free exercise question--well, I
won't beat it to death, but you said what you said. You said, "What
I do want to understand is that I approach the issue, or would ap-
proach the issue if it comes before me, with exactly the view of the
value of the strict scrutiny test which I described to you."
  Now, I don't know how, Judge, in any plainer English--we can
debate this, but I don't know how that says anything other than
what it says: "I would approach the issue with the view of the
value of the strict scrutiny test." Now, if that is not telling us what
principle you would apply, I don't understand. But, again, I don't
want to belabor it. I don't understand why in the free exercise area
you are--on page 49 of today's transcript--explicitly prepared to
tell us what standard you would apply, although I acknowledge, no
matter what you told us, you are prepared to listen to arguments.
No one doubts that. No one doubts that you are prepared to listen
to an argument if Senator Specter were before you. And he would
be arguing strict scrutiny. But if he were before you and said, no, it
shouldn't be strict scrutiny, it should be rational basis, you would
listen. No one doubts that. But you were willing to tell us what
standard you would apply, but you would sit down--as they say, O
ye, O ye, bang, you sit down, and you sit down strict scrutiny is
where you start. That is all I am asking you about the other area.
                                               200

  But let me leave it for a second and go to one--I will take one
last run at this. You have mentioned Justice Harlan several times.
If I can't get you to do in the procreation area what you are willing
to do, in my view, in the gender and free exercise area, let me ask
you to try this with me so I can have a better insight into how you
think, how you approach a problem.

  I have thought about how can I possibly do this because I had no
doubt where you were going to go. You are not about to tell me
what principles you are going to employ. And so I tried to think
last night about how could I get at your reasoning process. Forget
the statement of what principles you would apply. We are beyond
that. Let's just leave that aside. As I said, one more effort, so listen
to me. Maybe you can give me some insight here, OK?

  In response to a question--and what I came up with last night,
and I drove my staff crazy. I said, look, how do you ask a guy how
does he think? Not what standards, that is real easy. One of the
ways to figure out how you think is you say, well, here are the
standards that I apply, the principles from which I start. Another
way to say it, if you don't use that--which met with the rejoinder,
well, that is getting me too close to case-specific, so I won t--how
do you get to the guy and say, okay, just tell me, how do you think?
And I went back to old Harlan, God bless him. He was a great Jus-
tice.

  This morning, Senator Grassley in a different context got you
talking about that a little bit in a way that sort of clicked in my
mind that maybe this is the way to go about it, and let me try it.

  This is harder than talking to Warren Rudman, you know?
[Laughter.]

  As a matter of fact, it is similar. No wonder you guys are such
close friends.

  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say, at least you have gotten the
chance to do that. You know, what I said yesterday, I just listen.

  The CHAIRMAN. It is only because there are certain Senate rules
on the floor. When one Senator has the floor, the other cannot
speak.

  In response to a question from Senator Grassley this morning,
you said something that I would like to pick up on. You said that
the one thing that judges need to "work on"--he was going into
what is the proper role of a judge--is the "criteria they use" to de-
termine which enumerated rights will be deemed protected by our
Constitution. And I would like to ask you about the criteria that
you would use, just like the criteria that Harlan used and enunci-
ated.

  In response to another question from Senator Grassley, you sug-
gested that your criteria would be similar to those employed by
Justice Harlan, and you identified two criteria in particular. And I
want to be specific; that is why I am reading from this. I don't
want to misrepresent your position.

  You identified two criteria in particular that you used which you
seem to find helpful. One was whether the deprivation of such a
right, an asserted right, an asserted liberty, would be contrary to
the concept of ordered liberty. So I am real clear for me because
you are--and I am not being solicitous. This is stating the obvious.
You are the scholar. I do this among other things.
                                      201
  What we are talking about here is an assertion of a liberty inter-
est not enumerated in the Constitution by an individual, and a
State coming along and saying, wrong, you can't do that, you don't
have that constitutionally protected right. It is not constitutionally
protected any longer. It may have been constitutionally protected
to some degree, but the State trumps you. The State comes along
and has a better right to take it away than you have to retain and
exercise it.
  You said when that debate is taking place, one of the issues is
whether or not the right would be contrary to the concept of or-
dered liberty; and, second, you said, "A search of the American tra-
dition" to see if the rights fall within that tradition.
  Now, before I ask you about these criteria, Judge, that I want to
get into, have I accurately stated the views you expressed to Sena-
tor Grassley: that ordered liberty and a search for the American
tradition would be at least two of the criteria you would use for
determining whether or not there is a constitutionally protected
unenumerated right in the Constitution?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, with this one caveat, which I think is unnec-
essary: You and I, we are both abbreviating Justice Harlan's lan-
guage when we were speaking of that second approach to reason-
ing. But with that, yes, of course.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Judge, I am particularly interested in this
notion of search of the American tradition that you spoke of. As
you know, one heated debate in modern constitutional law--not
about any specific case but about general principles--concerns just
how judges should go about "searching for our traditions."
  Now, Justice Scalia--in a case called Michael H. v. Gerald D.--
and the facts of the case are not relevant so, please, in the time I
have left, let's not get off into the facts of the case.
  Judge SOUTER. I promise.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Unless you think they are relevant or neces-
sary in order for you to answer.
  He explained his methodology this way in Footnote 6, which is
becoming a famous footnote: "I would refer to the most specific
level at which a relevant tradition protecting or denying protection
to the asserted right can be identified." Now, this is understood to
be a narrowing of the idea of unenumerated rights, because under
it, unless the particular and specific right being asserted by the in-
dividual has long been recognized in our tradition, the Court,
adopting this reasoning, would not recognize it.
  Two other conservatives on the Court, I might add--Justices
O'Connor and Kennedy--rejected this method as being too
cramped. They said, "When identifying liberty interest protected
by the due process clause, on occasion the Court has characterized
relevant traditions protecting asserted rights at levels of generality
that might not be the most specific level available." Then they spe-
cifically cited Loving, and let me make sure we get into that.
  Loving, as you know better than I do, was a Virginia case years
ago, striking down the anti-miscegenation laws which said black
folks can't marry white and white can't marry black.
  Now, the way Justice Scalia would approach Loving, if his rea-
soning is consistent--and I think it is. He is a very bright fellow
and totally consistent, to the best of my knowledge. He says don't
                                                202

go back and look at whether or not marriage, the institution of
marriage is granted and viewed in American tradition with a sense
of sanctity and privacy. That is too general. Go back in our history
and look at whether or not our American tradition recognized the
rights of blacks and whites to marry.

  That is the specific tradition we must investigate. Did it exist or
did it not exist?

  So, it depends from whence you start, it is like that old thing
about computers, "garbage in, garbage out." Depending on where
you start is going to determine in your little syllogism how it is
built and what answer you give.

  Now, Justice Scalia says you should look at the most specific
right being asserted. In this case, Justice Kennedy and Justice
O Connor say no, you have got to go a little broader sometimes.

  Now, Judge, without getting into how you would have decided
Michael H. or Loving or any other specific case, could you tell me
which of the two methodologies you would employ?

  Judge SOUTER. I could not accept the view that, as a rule always
to be applied, the most specific evidence is the only valid evidence,
and I do not think that Justice Harlan would have done so, either.

  It is a quest for a greater degree of certainty that we understand,
and it seems to me that the quest for the kind of evidence that we
are after should be a quest not for evidence which, as a matter of
definition or a matter of absolute necessity has either got to be of
narrow compass or of general compass, rather, it has got to be a
quest for reliable evidence, and there may be reliable evidence of
great generality.

  The analogy that I thought of, as you were describing that, is far
from a perfect analogy, but I think I will throw it out anyway. We
do not say, when we are engaging in the normal evidentiary prob-
lems in the trial court, that we will accept only direct evidence and
not circumstantial. We do not narrow down our kind of search for
truth in ways like that, and I think

  The CHAIRMAN. But, Judge, does it not determine what evidence
you are accepting to assert what proposition? If the evidence you
are seeking is whether or not marriage is protected historically,
that is one thing. If the evidence you are seeking out, the reliable
evidence is to determine whether or not blacks and whites marry-
ing has been a tradition in our tradition, that is a different thing,
right?

  Judge SOUTER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. And that is what I am asking you, the fun-
damental issue, do you think we need to determine when the inves-
tigation begins, the narrowest application of the right asserted, or
a broader application of the right asserted?
  Judge SOUTER. The answer is we cannot, as a matter of definition
at the beginning of our inquiry, narrow the acceptable evidence to
the most narrow evidence possible
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. I now yield
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. And I think Justice Harlan would
have given the same answer to that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Maybe I can come back to
it.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you.
                                               203

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge, we have a very distinguished and
able Chairman, but I am glad you did not answer the questions the
way he wanted you to answer them. [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. I hope you will have a persuasive effect on the
Chairman, Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, earlier this morning, one of
my colleagues, I understand, referred to a letter suggesting that all
of your decisions in the area of labor are in favor of management
interests.
  Let me refresh your memory by citing to you the opinion which
you wrote in Panto v. Moore Business Forms, which concerns a con-
tinuation of a laid-off employee's salary. There are other cases in
which you have ruled in favor of the employee. Is it not true that
Panto and these other opinions can fairly be construed as rulings
in favor of employees?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, yes, the answer is yes to that and I see
your staff has been busy at lunch and I have had some help at
lunch myself. I would be glad to supply you or the committee with
some citations to things that I did not think of at that time.
  Let me just say, if I may, just a word about the Panto case, since
you have mentioned it and I think Senator Simon probably would
have interest in it: Panto is a case brought by a so-called at-will
employee or on behalf of an at-will employee who had been given
what is known as an employee's handbook, which supposedly set
out the terms and conditions of employment.
  One of the terms and conditions that were described in that
handbook was a right to deferred compensation upon the termina-
tion of his employment. The question in the Panto case was wheth-
er the employer could unilaterally simply revoke that particular
condition, and one of the arguments made was that an at-will em-
ployee could be fired at any time, by definition, and, therefore, the
conditions of employment can be changed at any time.
  The holding of the court in New Hampshire, which was unani-
mous in adopting the opinion that I wrote, was that, in giving that
kind of a handbook, you are engaging in exactly the same kind of
enterprise that you do when you make a unilateral contract, you
are holding out a set of terms and saying if you will do something
for me, these are the terms upon which you will be recompensed or
will be rewarded.
  I have to say that I really did not think the reasoning in the
case, including the analogy to the unilateral contract, was very re-
markable, but I do know that in similar cases courts in other juris-
dictions, particularly in times past, have gone the other way.
  So, it is true, it was--I would not have put it, if I had been classi-
fying my cases, as a pro-labor case, but if you are going to draw
that kind of distinction, I think that is the decidable line that it
belongs on.
  Senator SIMON. If my colleague would yield, I want to thank
Judge Souter.
  Senator THURMOND. I would be pleased to yield.
  Senator SIMON. I would just ask, Mr. Chairman, that the record
be open here, if there should be any other cases that Judge Souter
would want to enter in the record at this point, too.
                                                204

   Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.
   Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, recently there have been con-
siderable scholarly debate in the Congress and opinions issued by
the Federal courts concerning constitutional protection of expres-
sive conduct under the first amendment. How would you character-
ize the distinctions of protections under the free speech clause be-
tween expressive non-oral conduct and the actual spoken word?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, the problem that has to be confronted in
those cases is that when there is a combination of expressive con-
duct and speech in the most literal sense, the kind of conduct
which is used for expressive purposes may be subject to reasonable
and legitimate regulation by the government, in a way that mere
words would not be.
  Therefore, what the courts have done is to try to come up with a
test for evaluating the government's interest in the conduct, as op-
posed to the speech or the merely expressive part of it, and the test
that has been devised consists of asking whether, in some way in-
fringing on what would otherwise be an absolute freedom to engage
in that expressive conduct, the government has a substantial and
legitimate interest which is unrelated to the regulation of free ex-
pression, and, if so, whether the particular law which tends to re-
strict the right of expression there does so in a way which is nar-
rowly tailored to serve that governmental interest and to infringe
on the right of expression no more than is absolutely essential.
  It is a kind of line-drawing, when conduct is complex, some of it
clearly subject to first amendment standards and some of it subject
to regulation on grounds having nothing to do with speech.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, under our Constitution, we
have three very distinct branches of government. It is my firm
belief that the role of the judiciary is to interpret the law and not
make the law.
  However, there have been times when judges have gone beyond
their responsibility of interpreting the law and, instead, have exer-
cised their individual will, as judicial activists. Would you please
briefly describe your views on the topic of judicial activism?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, there are, I suppose, a great many things
we could say, but there are two aspects of it which I think are fore-
most in our minds. The first is the appropriateness of judicial
remedy. Sometimes activists have been criticized for seeming to
look for causes, rather than cases.
  I do not know that there is much we can say, in general, about
it, except what I said on the questionnaire which was filed with the
committee, that the extent of a judge's obligation to provide reme-
dies in a case in which some violation or infringement of right has
been found is primarily and, in the first instance, a function of the
case before him. It is a function of the extent of the violation that
he has found.
  The second sense of activism which I think is probably in the
back of everyone's minds is a sense that I have touched upon in
earlier remarks before the committee, and that is a sense of the
judge as embodying pure personal preferences and value choices,
however sincerely they may be felt, as opposed to embodying
values which are found and based upon some kind of an objective
                                      205
search for meaning, whether it be the meaning of Constitution and
the meaning of statute.

  I think I have said more than once during the course of these
hearings that my approach to the obligation of judging is to try to
find an objective source of meaning that simply does not force the
court into, in effect, giving free rein to its own predilections.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the Supreme Court recognized
a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in the case of
United States v. Leon. This exception applies only to searches made
pursuant to a warrant. Would you discuss the effect of the exclu-
sionary rule and the good-faith exception in preventing police mis-
conduct?

  Judge SOUTER. AS you know, Senator, the basis for the exclusion-
ary rule, as it was explained in Mapp v. Ohio, the case that applied
the exclusionary rule to the States, was to induce the police, to
induce the executive branch of the government from engaging in
activities which violated fourth amendment rights, and the theory
was that if the police could not profit, if the prosecution could not
profit by using evidence illegally seized, there would therefore be
an inducement to avoid seizing evidence illegally, so that the object
of the exclusionary rule as a means to enforce the values of the
fourth amendment was a very pragmatic one. But the focus of that
explanation was, of course, on police conduct.

  That point is reflected in the Leon case, as you have just de-
scribed it, because what the Leon case is saying is that if the mis-
take which leads us to conclude that there has been a fourth
amendment violation was a mistake not made by the police, but
made by the judge or a magistrate who issued the warrant, that
should not preclude the introduction of evidence on the theory de-
scribed in Mapp v. Ohio. If the mistake is not the police's mistake,
then you gain nothing in influencing police conduct by keeping the
evidence out.

  The one overriding limitation which was placed, of course, on the
Leon rule is that the mistake must not only have been a judicial
mistake, but the kind of mistake which the police could nonethe-
less, as it were, in good-faith proceed without recognizing, and,
therefore, I think the Leon rule is entirely consistent with the ra-
tionale for the exclusionary rule as described in Mapp.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the Supreme Court's decisions
in the cases of Teague y. Lane and Penry v. Linnow have ended
what has been an essentially ad hoc approach to the area of consti-
tutional criminal law known as retroactivity. This area of the law
deals with whether or not a Supreme Court decision is retroactive-
ly applicable to previous convictions.

  As you know, the Teague and Penry cases limited the principle of
retroactivity by creating the rule that the legality of a prisoner's
sentence will usually be measured by the law in effect at the time
of his trial and direct appeal, unless the Supreme Court declares
that a subsequent ruling shall apply retroactively.

  The effect of these decisions has the greatest impact in the area
of Federal habeas corpus. Would you please comment generally
about the legal basis for the Court's ruling in Teague and Penry?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, there is a curious parallel between the
explanation that I am going to give you now and the discussion
                                                206

that we had just a second ago on the good-faith exception, because
as the Court has explained it and as you know, the Teague and the
Penry cases refer to the availability of what is known as collateral
relief by writ of habeas corpus in the Federal courts for State pris-
oners.

  What that means in practical terms is that a State criminal de-
fendant may well have been through the State criminal justice
system by way of direct appeal or even collateral review in the
State system, have taken his request for relief as far as the Su-
preme Court of the United States and have been denied discretion-
ary review and still have an opportunity to raise constitutional
claims by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal
courts. And because the relief is sought by a new proceeding, we
call it collateral, rather than a source of direct relief.

  Now, as the Supreme Court of the United States has explained
the theory behind underlying Federal habeas corpus relief in situa-
tions like this, it in effect has said we recognize that not all consti-
tutional errors may get corrected in the course of direct review in
the State system, and collateral relief by writ of Federal habeas
corpus is provided as an inducement to the State systems to do a
good and sound and reliable job of constitutional adjudication, be-
cause if they do not, they know that the prisoner has another
avenue of relief in the Federal system.

  Now, what the two cases that you describe have held, starting
with Teague, what they have held is that if a prisoner is going to
get relief on habeas corpus collaterally in the Federal system, with
two minor exceptions--well, not minor, but two exceptions, that
relief has got to be based on the law that was in existence at the
time the State courts reviewed the conviction, and the reason for
this is they are saying we provide this relief in order to induce reli-
ability and good faith and constitutional adjudication by the State
courts.

  That is a value which is not going to be served, if we also grant
relief on the basis of law which was not in existence or had not
been declared at the time the State courts did their review. In
other words, I suppose in a very simplistic way, we cannot blame
them for failing to follow some law which was not there for them
to follow at the time. Therefore, under those cases, Federal habeas
relief is restricted and is available only for violations of the law as
it stood at the time.

  As I said, there are two exceptions to that for changes in the law
which recognize conduct or penalty totally beyond the power of the
courts to impose and for violations which go to the fundamental re-
liability of a conviction. But subject to those two exceptions, habeas
relief is, therefore, limited and it is limited in a way which is con-
sistent with its object.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the issue of capital punish-
ment is a controversial topic, with strongly held views on both
sides. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the death penal-
ty is a constitutional form of punishment, provided steps are taken
to insure that it is not imposed with unfettered discretion.

  Certainly, there are judges who are personally opposed to the
death penalty. Since the Supreme Court has ruled that the death
penalty is constitutional, what role, if any, should the personal
                                                207

opinion of a judge play in decisions he or she may render in cases
such as the death penalty?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, we all work with the ideal that the kind
of personal opinion which may be at variance with the law is not
going to play a role in the judicial decision. When we get to an
area like the imposition of the death penalty, we also I think have
to recognize the limits on what is humanly and morally possible.

  I do not know whether there are any States, I presume there are
none, in which the death penalty decision is one which is rendered
in the discretion of the judge, and I presume that that is totally out
of the question today. But even though a judge may not have the
role of deciding that the death penalty may be imposed, the judge
certainly may have great moral qualms, if the judge is morally op-
posed to the death penalty, in taking part in a proceeding which
could have the result of an imposition which he believes is morally
wrong.

  I think what judges have to recognize in those circumstances is
perhaps there are cases in which their moral views are so strong
that they simply cannot preside, and I think we have to recognize
the moral compunctions that a judge would feel in those circum-
stances and we have to recognize a right to recuse if a judge feels
that way.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, prison overcrowding is a
major problem facing Federal and State institutions today. Several
State systems are currently under Federal prisoner cap orders
which limit committing additional inmates to certain prisons. At a
time when violent crime and drug offenses are such a problem,
what other alternatives are available to insure that prison space is
available for those sentenced to serve time?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, as you know, one of the proposals that
has gained attention and currency in some places has been referred
to as the privatization of prisons, in effect, the contracting out of
what traditionally has been regarded as a direct State function and
State responsibility for imprisonment.

  I am not sure, in response to the question that you describe, that
that really is an alternative, because if any one thing is clear, it is
that so many of our prison overcrowding problems are functions of
the amount of money that can be spent or is spent in prison con-
struction and prison administration.

  There is no question that if prisons are not to be expanded, if al-
ternative facilities are not to be found, and the rates and periods of
incarcerations tend to rise, as in many places they are as a result
of the activity in drug prosecution, then there may very well have
to be value choices made by the States to change the possible pen-
alties in other crimes, so that there will be room in the prisons for
those thought by the legislature to have the first priority in the
need for prison space.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, Congress established the U.S.
Sentencing Commission in 1984. Its function is to promulgate sen-
tencing guidelines for Federal judges, to insure uniform and pre-
dictable prison sentences.

  The Supreme Court ruled, in the case of United States v. Men-
strata that these sentencing guidelines are constitutional. From
your experience as a judge, do you believe that uniformity in sen-
                                               208

tencing is more fair to those individuals who commit similar
crimes and, in the long run, will sentencing guidelines create great-
er confidence in the criminal justice system?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think the sentencing guidelines will
create a greater confidence in the justice of the system. I would not
take the position, I do not think anyone takes the position that sen-
tences have got to be imposed absolutely, without judicial discre-
tion.

  But I do think very strongly that the judicial discretion which is
exercised in sentencing should be a very structured and disciplined
discretion, otherwise the problem of disparity in sentencing is
simply insoluble. Like countless other judges, I have sat on a court
in which sentence is set to be rendered. One of the concerns that I
and, I suppose, most other judges have is that, if Judge A gives a
sentence twice as long as Judge B for the same offense, there has
got to be a very strong and apparent reason for that disparity,
without the belief that there is, in fact, injustice in the sentencing
system.

  My concern about the effectiveness of this perception of injustice
is not limited simply to the perception of the public. I think there
should be an equal concern for the perception of the defendants
who are sentenced. If there is going to be any hope for any rehabil-
itative effect in sentencing, particularly on young and early offend-
ers, it seems to me it has got to rest upon a reasonable perception
that the system in which the sentence has been imposed is itself a
fair system.

  I applaud the efforts of the government to devise sentencing
guidelines. As I think you may know, the chief judge of the court
on which I now sit was one member of the commission that pro-
posed the guidelines that we have.

  Senator THURMOND. Incidentally, Senator Kennedy and I worked
very hard on that question.

  Judge Souter, the Sentencing Commission is considering whether
the current Federal criminal sentences are adequate. In fact, the
commission will promulgate new guidelines for white collar and
corporate offenses. Congress has also seen fit to increase the terms
of imprisonment for various white collar crimes, including those in-
volving financial institutions.

  From your experience, have penalties for white collar and corpo-
rate defendants been sufficient, and do you anticipate tougher pen-
alties for white collar criminals in the future, as a result of the
public outcry over the recent savings and loan offenses and securi-
ties-related crimes?

  Judge SOUTER. My experience, Senator, has been entirely in the
State system. As you know, I am a member of the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit right now, but I have sat
there hardly at all.

  I do have a very vivid recollection of the problem of white collar
crime in the State. The problem there was not that penalties were
insufficient in the sense of there being no penalties on the books
which were adequate to the offense. But there was for a long time,
certainly in the early years in which I was practicing law and en-
gaged in the criminal justice system, an unspoken feeling that
somehow the white collar criminal should at least get one free
                                      209

chance or the feeling that the white collar criminal, even when
caught, should never in fact be sentenced to incarceration. This
seemed to me was both morally unjust and socially indefensible.

  I can recall being, I think, part of the process within the courts
by which a very different kind of look on white collar sentencing
has been gradually taken effect, and suffice it to say, I do not take
the position and have never taken the position that the white
collar criminal should be dealt with in some way which is essen-
tially different from any other brand of criminal.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, is it your opinion that the
Federal Government was designed to be a government of limited
powers? If so, do you have a legal basis for your position which you
would discuss with the committee?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, we know, without much fear of argu-
ment on the point, that the basic conception of the Constitution, as
it was proposed in 1787, was that of a government of limited
powers. That very assumption was the reason why a Bill of Rights
was not proposed, because the reasoning went that a government
whose powers were as limited as these were not a threat to civil
liberties and that civil liberties could be perfectly well guarded by
the bills of right in the State constitutions.

  The position of the Federal Government, of course, has in some
respects changed since 1787, and the biggest change has come
about as a result of the enactment of the 14th amendment, which
has given the government a power with respect to the subjects cov-
ered by the 14th amendment, which the constitutionalists of 1787
certainly never anticipated.

  So we know that there has been deliberate action by the country
in the adoption of the 14th amendment which has had an effect on
the constitutional theory of 1787, and the difficult issues that are
going to face the courts probably in the next decade or two is to
work out with a precision, which the courts have never done, just
the extent of added power, particularly to the Congress of the
United States, which was intended to be conveyed by section 5 of
the 14th amendment.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, there have been complaints
by Federal and State judges regarding the poor quality of advocacy
before the courts, including the Supreme Court. Throughout your
years of service on the bench, have you found that legal represen-
tation in the courts was adequate, and what in your opinion should
be done to insure that individuals get quality representation in the
courts?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, we all fuss, and frequently fuss with
reason, that the level of performance in the trial courts and the ap-
pellate courts is not what we wish it could be.

  There is not any ultimately generalization that is possible. I have
heard splendid arguments in the Supreme Court of New Hamp-
shire and I have heard some that were poor. I have seen lawyers
who seem barely above the level of competence in the trial courts
and I have seen others who seemed to be geniuses of trial law.

  I think you put your finger on one approach to the problem of
trial competence, when at the end of your question you refer to the
adequacy of the level of representation, and I think when you do
                                      210

that, you make reference particularly to representation in the area
of the criminal law.

  I alluded yesterday to the fact that, when I first started practic-
ing law, every lawyer sort of took the cases that were assigned to
him by people who needed representation without cost, and law-
yers took on criminal representation under the same circum-
stances.

  One thing we found is that in criminal law, as in anything else,
it helps to be an expert. And one of the things we have found--and
I am sure this is true not only in New Hampshire, but throughout
the Nation--is that the federally funded public defenders, usually
federally funded or State funded public defenders, have provided a
degree of expertness in criminal representation which it is virtual-
ly impossible to get, simply by drafting a lawyer in private practice
who does not do criminal law, suddenly to take over the represen-
tation of a defendant.

  We have had exactly the same experience in looking at the
criminal appellate work which is funded, whether by State or Fed-
eral dollars, as a result of which we have an expert criminal appel-
late bar which is the envy and the equal of the prosecution in the
State. This kind of evening up of the level of representation has, in
fact, brought about a quality of justice which was unknown when I
got admitted to the bar.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Souter, the caseload of the Supreme
Court has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Cases today
are more complex, as our laws have become far more numerous
and intricately fashioned. Would you please give the committee
your thoughts on the current caseload of the Supreme Court, with-
out going into great detail, and comment briefly on any innovative
methods you may have utilized at the State or Federal level for
handling this increased caseload?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think it would be presumptuous of me
to try to give a disquisition on the United States Supreme Court's
caseload, which I, of course, have had no personal experience with.

  The one thing all of us outside the Court are aware of, although
we are probably inadequately aware of, is the enormous pressure of
that caseload, in the number of petitions for review and in the
pressure on the Court to accept the maximum number of cases
which may exhaust its limited time.

  As you know, in the course of the last term of the Supreme
Court, the number of cases taken has been reduced somewhat, and
that seems to me an appropriate thing for the Supreme Court to
do.

  At the State level, we too have had caseload problems. One effect
of that in my own State was, as a practical matter, to force the
State Supreme Court to go to a system of discretionary review, de-
ciding whether or not to take a given case for which an appeal is
decided, as against the old system when I was younger, in which
everybody had an appeal of right.

  One of the other effects of the growing caseload, as we said the
other day, yesterday, was to foster ways of disposing of cases out-
side of the traditional adversary judicial system, sometimes under
its auspices, sometimes on a purely private basis.
                                      211

  I can tell you that the exploration of what everybody tends to
group together under the title of alternate dispute resolution is, I
think, an extremely hopeful sign. There is only one thing that I
fear, and that is that, as State budgets continue to be squeezed and
as money for the judicial system becomes harder and harder to
find, in competition with the other claimants for limited State
budgets, that there is going to continue to be such a squeeze, par-
ticularly in the civil area, where there are no mandatory constitu-
tional standards or few mandatory standards for speedy trial, that
in fact private civil litigants are going to get squeezed out of the
judicial system, and as they get squeezed out of, simply because the
system cannot handle their cases, they are, instead, going to resort,
as they are already doing and are doing in my State, basically to
private judging, in which parties will get together and they will
hire somebody who may be called an arbitrator or may be called by
some other title, in effect to decide their cases for them, entirely
outside the judicial system, simply so that they can get the cases
decided.

  If this trend continues, the great fear that I have is that we are
going to be creating in the United States essentially two systems of
justice, and the only people who are going to be using the civil jus-
tice system, if this is carried to extremes, are in fact the people
who cannot go outside and spend money out of their pockets to hire
a judge or someone in the private sector to adjudicate their cases.

  This seems to me an appalling prospect, not only appalling for
the judicial system, but appalling for the Nation in the broader
sense, that we are going to lose one of the institutions and one of
the symbols that binds us together as a Nation, and that is a
system of justice open to everyone, and that justice certainly has
got to include civil as well as criminal justice.

  Senator THURMOND. My time is up. Thank you, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, just a few moments ago, in response to questions of Sena-
tor Thurmond, you talked about the moral dilemma that some
judges might face who are against the death penalty and yet must
impose it, and I thought you demonstrated some legitimate concern
for those particular judges.
  Then you talked about the whole question of the morality of sen-
tencing, in terms of white collar criminals, and I thought you were
very eloquent when you talked about the fact that some of those
who were involved in white collar crime might expect that they
should, at least for the first offense, not do time, and you expressed
your own kind of moral concern that that was not correct.
  Picking up on that question, let me ask you this, whether, as a
matter of your own individual and personal moral beliefs, do you
believe that abortion is moral or immoral?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I am going to respectfully ask to decline
to answer that question, for this reason, that whether I do or do
not find it moral or immoral, will play absolutely no role in any
decision which I make, if I am asked to make it, on the question of
what weight should or legitimate may be given to the interest
which is represented by the abortion decision.
                                      212

  I think to answer that question and to get into a matter of per-
sonal morality of mine, when it would not affect my judgment,
would go far to dispel the promise of impartiality in approaching
this issue, if it comes before me.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, as you pointed out, it would not affect
what you may or may not do in the Roe v. Wade case, and I think
that is certainly understandable. Something could be moral, and
yet not be protected by constitutional law; other things can be im-
moral and be protected by constitutional right, so this is irrelevant,
basically, on the question of how you would rule on Roe v. Wade.

  Judge SOUTER. It would be irrelevant to my decision, yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. Why do you feel hesitancy or reluctance, then,
to express what you were willing to express about the morality in
the application of the death penalty for individuals who have
moral beliefs, and what you are willing to express about your own
moral belief when it came to the question of white-collar crime?
Why can you not share with us your view about whether abortion
is moral or immoral or perhaps moral in certain cases and may be
immoral in other kinds of cases? Obviously, you have given a great
deal of thought to this? When you were on the New Hampshire Su-
preme Court, you were concerned about physicians and the rights
of physicians not to counsel a patient on the availability of abor-
tions. We know how you feel on the question of morality of that
question. You were quite willing to express it.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator
  Senator KENNEDY. Why the reluctance now to indicate what your
view is on this?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, there are two things here. The first goes
to the Smith v. Coady concurring opinion that you referred to.
That opinion did not rest upon any moral judgment of mine about
the morality of the procedure. It represented a perception that
those who may be engaged in counseling that could affect that pro-
cedure could find themselves, as the result of their moral positions,
in an impossible bind if the Court did not allude to what their re-
sponsibility should be. That was an expression of my concern about
their moral dilemma, not an expression of my moral position on
the issue itself.
  The other distinction is that the other moral questions that you
referred to are not implicated by any case that I see reasonably
coming before the Court; whereas, the moral position on the abor-
tion issue is, of course, clearly implicated by the request for Roe v.
Wade reexamination because people on each side of the issue are
impelled by very profoundly felt moral beliefs.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, we won't get into the question of wheth-
er we still have a strong division of the country for and against the
death penalty or on the question of sentencing. But Sandra Day
O'Connor responded to that question, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. With respect, sir, I do not believe I could do so
without creating the impression that I could not give a fair hearing
to people whose views might differ from mine on that. And I am
not familiar with Justice O'Connor's answer on that subject. It may
have depended upon prior opinions that she had given.
  What I do believe, Senator, is that for me in this forum to start
in the most serious discussion, even with you, to an expression of
                                      213
my views of the morality on that subject would be taken by a sub-
stantial number of people as the beginning of a commitment on my
part to go in one direction or another. You and I undoubtedly could
agree that it should not be so interpreted, and it would not so por-
tend my decision one way or the other.

   I do not believe it is realistic to expect that a substantial number
of people listening to our discussion would share our views.

   Senator KENNEDY. Why is that? Why do you arrogate to yourself
the feeling that the American people can't understand that or
make a judgment? What do you know and I know that is superior
to the common sense of the American people when you are being
recommended to serve on a Court that is going to be the guardian
of the basic rights and liberties of those people? I find that kind of
comment and statement troubling, Judge

  Judge SOUTER. No; I
  Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. To say that I can tell you and you
can tell me and we can understand, but the great number of people
who are watching this whole hearing can't understand it. I mean, I
think that attitude is troublesome.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I am taking you at your word, Senator, that
you believe it would not affect my judgment, and I know that you
are taking me at my word that it would not affect my judgment.
But I believe also
  Senator KENNEDY. And you expect the American people to take
that as well.
  Judge SOUTER. I believe that there are a great many people who
would not accept the view that you and I are willing to hold. And I
don't believe that those people should be subjected to the kind of
moral discussion which in their view would clearly compromise my
objectivity. I think a great many of those people would say I am
willing to accept his judgment that his own moral view will not in-
fluence his decision in the case. But if he then engages in a public
moral disquisition on what that judgment is, it must be because
there actually is some indication about what he would do in that
discussion.
  And I do not think we should ask people, as it were, with a
double standard, number one, to accept that the position is irrele-
vant, and yet at the same time to engage in a discussion of the sub-
ject which you and I agree is irrelevant.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you wouldn't even share with us wheth-
er you think in the circumstance of rape or incest that there is a
moral question or issue? You wouldn't tell us whether you feel that
that was morally repugnant?
  Judge SOUTER. I can certainly indicate, as I hope anyone would,
that the complexity of the moral equation may change in those cir-
cumstances, but I would respectfully be asked to be excused from
answering that question.
  Senator KENNEDY. I thought you gave us a very moving story
yesterday when you indicated that a number of years ago you
counseled this student and the anxiety that you went through over
that 2-hour period in that closed room. And, clearly, no one asked
you what our counsel was, and I think that that is certainly appro-
priate, nor were you willing to share that counsel with us, which I
think was appropriate as well.

         39-454--91 8
                                      214
  But I think that the refusal to answer a basic kind of question on
the issue of morality when you have just within 15 minutes talked
about the morality of the death penalty and about sentencing
white-collar crime, must be troublesome to many women in this
country, on this issue which is of such basic and fundamental im-
portance, where there is extraordinary division. Certainly there is
in this panel.
  Can you understand the anxiety that they might feel that you
are not prepared to make even a comment?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I can understand anxiety on both sides of
the issue. I also think it is important to distinguish the significance
of the subjects that I was talking about a few moments ago. I was
not talking about my personal views on the death penalty. I was
talking about the personal concern that a judge who believes the
death penalty is wrong would have if he is asked to take a part in
its administration.
  With respect to the morality of sentencing on white-collar crime,
that did not involve a question of whether it is moral to sentence
or not. It involved the question of whether sentencing should take
place on the basis of evenhanded standards evenhandedly imposed
on all sorts and varieties of crime. And upon that matter, I think
there is no division within the country.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you were the one that used "morally" as
associated with white-collar crime. I wrote it down. I will let the
record rest on it, but you were the one that used the words, the
moral issue with white-collar crime.
  Judge SOUTER. And I believe there is, indeed, a moral obligation
for evenhandedness in criminal sentencing.
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU are sensitive to the issue of morality on
death penalty, sensitive to the issue of morality on sentencing of
white-collar crime; but on the issue of abortion--I am not asking
you at all about Roe v. Wade, but on the issue of abortion you are
not prepared to make any comment or statement
  Judge SOUTER. On the issue of abortion
  Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. On what is your view, whether it
is moral or immoral, or at least whether you have some feel for the
outrageous circumstances of rape or incest that you are prepared
to make any kind of comment or statement on.
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think you know from the discussion
yesterday afternoon of my concern for the circumstances in which
these questions arise. But a discussion of morality in the context of
this hearing of the Roe v. Wade decision I believe would be inter-
preted, in effect, as inconsistent with the view I have expressed
that my personal views would not play a part in the decision. And
I will respectfully ask you to excuse me from answering that ques-
tion.
  Senator KENNEDY. Just to get back very quickly on the matters
that we talked about yesterday on the EEOC, the church and state
issues that were talked about this morning, literacy tests that we
talked about, you indicated that you were acting as the lawyer for
the Governor. I reviewed with you the oath. I didn't put it in the
record; I will. The oath of office that you take as attorney general
talks about upholding the Federal Constitution as well as the State
constitution and the statute. It sets out the responsibilities for the
                                      215
State attorney general as well. But you have taken the position
that these cases were brought as a result of representing the Gov-
ernor.

  What I would like to ask you is whether you formed any person-
al view when you were preparing those cases. Did you form any
personal view about their rightfulness or wrongfulness? I think as
lawyers we know we take the cases, and we do the best we can as
lawyers in those circumstances. But sometimes when the outcome
is in, even if we are on one side and we don't prevail, we are kind
of relieved that the other side won.

  Judge SOUTER. As you rightly say, we can sometimes accept our
losses with great equanimity because we recognized that, in fact,
the right result has been achieved. Our responsibility in those cir-
cumstances is the responsibility to be the best advocates that we
can.

  As I said this morning, one of the foundations upon which I
think the vitality of our constitutional system rests is that there
will, in fact, be vigorous litigation to give the courts the best
chances that they can have to get it right. And if we play a part in
good faith and with vigor in those circumstances, I think we can be
proud of ourselves.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I come back to this, Judge, because I
thought yesterday you talked in a very convincing way about each
time that you make a ruling or make representation, you are con-
scious about what the impact is going to be on individuals.

  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator KENNEDY. That was stated a number of times yesterday
by yourself. So when I think of what the impact would be of your
position, if it had prevailed in opposing or questioning the author-
ity of the Congress on abandoning the literacy tests, or on collect-
ing information in order to be able to strike down discrimination,
what the impact would be on blacks, what the impact would be on
women, on minorities--I am just wondering whether during that
period of time you ever formed an opinion as to what you hoped
that that judge would rule?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I doubtless formed an opinion, but the
opinion was related to the case that I was arguing. The question
that you make assumes that I was arguing, for example, as advo-
cate for the State in the EEOC case, that the EEOC could never
lawfully collect statistics when there was an indication that dis-
crimination had taken place. That, of course, was not the position
of the State.
  The argument assumes that in the case of literacy tests I might
have been arguing that literacy tests should be enforced, even
when they were being enforced for discriminatory purposes. In fact,
what I was arguing is that a literacy test which had already been
declared constitutional when used for nondiscriminatory purposes
should be within the power of the State.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask this: Do you believe the right
result was achieved in those three cases: church/state, the literacy
test, the EEOC statistics?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the right result for the Nation was,
indeed, achieved. The question in the cases before us was: Can you
get the right result for the Nation and still leave States which have
                                      216
done no wrong in the position that they were in? The Supreme
Court of the United States said, as a practical matter, Congress is
correct to say no.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do you agree with it?
  Judge SOUTER. I accept that decision, yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am not asking whether you accept it.
You have to accept it. I mean, if you
  Judge SOUTER. Well, when I say I accept it, I say I am willing to
agree that, in fact, Congress has that power and properly used it in
those cases.
  Senator KENNEDY. But you don't tell us whether you personally
think that that was the right outcome.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, if you--sir?
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU are telling us that you accept it, which
you have to. If it is 9-0 on the Supreme Court, you have to. I am
just asking you personally. Do you think it was right?
  Judge SOUTER. Are you asking me whether I think literacy tests
should be used
  Senator KENNEDY. I am asking you whether the final result
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. For any discriminatory purpose?
  Senator KENNEDY. NO, no. Listen. You are a good listener here.
  Judge SOUTER. OK.
  Senator KENNEDY. In each of the final outcomes of those three
cases--the EEOC and the literacy test and the church and state
cases--when they were decided did you think that the outcome was
right?
  Judge SOUTER. I think today the outcome is right.
  Senator KENNEDY. Was the outcome right then? Did you believe
that the outcome was right then?
  Judge SOUTER. On the literacy test, I had a more complex reac-
tion than that. The trouble in the literacy test case was
  Senator KENNEDY. Just answer, Judge, please. Those three, yes
or no. Can I get a yes or no?
  Senator THURMOND. He can explain it.
  Judge SOUTER. The answer is yes with one qualification on the
literacy test case, and that was it seemed to me at the time that a
State which was acting consistently with the 14th amendment--
and the State was--had done no wrong. I think it is correct to say
my judgment today is that probably the problem of literacy tests
could not have been dealt with as a national problem except in the
way that Congress did. But, I would not concede that there was
something inappropriate about defending a practice which the Su-
preme Court of the United States had declared to be constitutional.
  Senator KENNEDY. Talking about your position that you took on
the literacy, keeping in mind what you said yesterday about the
impact of your rulings or your representation on real people, you
also said that those who were illiterate, their votes diluted the
votes of people who can read. I remember that as well.
  Judge SOUTER. That is a mathematical statement, I think.
  Senator KENNEDY. It is a what?
  Judge SOUTER. I say that is essentially a kind of statement of
math.
  Senator KENNEDY. What is a statement of math? That if you
have people who can't read--as Father Hesburgh pointed out,
                                      217

when they were considering the 1970 Voting Rights Act, when he
said that American people can get information from television and
from radio and can make informed judgments, and you were reach-
ing a decision virtually at the same time--you said their votes
dilute the votes of people who can read, and now you are telling us
it is a matter of math?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think what I was referring to in the
quotation that you are making is a problem that Father Hesburgh
was not referring to. That is, we were concerned--and I think the
context in which that was made--you correct me if I am wrong--
was the context in which questions were being placed on constitu-
tional amendments in which the questions themselves were of
some great length and complexity, so that somebody who could not
read simply could not know what was before that person.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I will let the record be corrected by
either one of us. But as one who was around in 1970, the point was
made by many of those who represented States where these liter-
acy tests were lifted that we ought to have it nationally, uniform,
across the country; let's not target just Southern States. If we want
to have something as a matter of national policy, let's do it uni-
formly. The issue came up about what had been the impact the last
5 years when we had effectively eliminated the literacy tests. And
the question was brought up during that time, well, if you have
any illiterates, what has happened in those States? What has hap-
pened? Has it somehow distorted the whole voting process? And
Father Hesburgh, who was the head of the commission at that
time, said his commission made the finding that it had not, that
people could gain information through other means. I mean, you
can have people who work with their hands. You can have poor
people who haven't had the benefits of education, formal education,
and can be remarkably intelligent and informed.

  The real point is when you say that it is really just a question of
math, whether it is diluting the vote, you know, I think that that is
something I find troublesome.

  As I understand, then, on the other two matters--the church/
state and EEOC--did you believe at the time that they were the
correct decisions?

  Judge SOUTER. I would not have been engaging in the particular
practice in the church/state issue, and I think it is appropriate to
have a national collection standard on the EEOC.

  Senator KENNEDY. YOU know, you demonstrated--and I ad-
mired--the quality of resisting and standing up, and I think in re-
sponse to an earlier question today you said "crusading" on the
issue of gambling casinos in New Hampshire.

  Judge SOUTER. I am not sure I would use the word "crusade."
  Senator KENNEDY. OK. Well, I think it was asked whether--what
was it? Anyway, you took on a tough issue. You took on a tough
issue, a controversial issue, and were ready to stick your neck out,
which I have a good deal of admiration for. Second, you stood up to
the Governor on behalf of your attorney when they went down to
investigate certain of the preliminary safety requirements at Sea-
brook. I understand that there was a confrontation between you
and the Governor, or a difference. But at least as I understand it,
                                          218

you stood your ground, and I think that that is admirable. You ob-
viously felt strongly about it, fulfilling your responsibilities.

  I am just wondering how you reacted in those cases, particularly
in the church/state issue, after you got the preliminary ruling
from Judge Skinner in Boston that found that the declaration was
violative of church/state separation, and after they went back to
redraft it. The new draft came out and talked about Jesus being a
historical figure, I believe.

  Judge SOUTER. That was the tenor of it.
  Senator Kennedy. "Honored him as an historical figure without
regard to the religious issue."
  The thing I would ask you is, did it ever occur to you that that
was kind of demeaning religion, Christianity? You know, I mean, I
think those of us who have observed Good Friday--12 to 3 are the
special hours for the churches.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator--I am sorry.
  Senator KENNEDY. And now we are talking about Jesus as an
historical figure. Did that tick into your mind at all? I mean, it just
caught me sort of right away when we were looking through this,
and I just wondered whether it troubled you at all.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think, Senator, if that had been my procla-
mation, I think that would be a very fair objection to it. My own
religion is a religion which I wish to exercise in private and with as
little public--little expression in the political arena as is possible.
  Whether or not my client, at the time, believed it was demean-
ing, I do not know. I am sure he did not intend it in a demeaning
way.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I don't know what the time-
frame is.
  The CHAIRMAN. Finish up.
  Senator KENNEDY. I have just one area that I would like to direct
your attention, and this was in the Bouselet case. I think I indicat-
ed to you I was going to inquire of you about that.
  Judge SOUTER. YOU did, yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. In that case, we had two elderly brothers, 76
and 79 years old, who shared a single full-time job as janitor and
they had been doing it for 22 years. Then they lost their jobs and
were denied unemployment compensation on the ground that they
were not ready, willing, and able to work full-time as required by
State law. They felt the statute was not fair and tried to appeal the
decision against them. A hearing was held by the State Employ-
ment Commission. As I understand it, they didn't have a lawyer at
this stage, but they were assigned what is called a lay representa-
tive.
  They testified that they could not work full-time because one of
them had a weak back and the other was suffering from partial
blindness and angina. They said they could work 4 hours a day but
not 8 hours a day.
  Their unemployment benefits were denied by the Commission.
They had been paying in unemployment compensation over the
years that they had been working.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, their employer had been doing so, sir.
  Senator KENNEDY. Right. Well, in the State, there is no partici-
pation at all by the employee?
                                      219

  Judge SOUTER. I think it is just the employer who pays in.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, in any event, so they got a lawyer to
represent them at this point and they took the issue to your court,
the New Hampshire Supreme Court. They raised claims under the
Federal disability statute and Federal age discrimination law. You
wrote an opinion in that case and you rejected their claims.
  You know, perhaps the result was the correct one and perhaps it
was completely clear under the law you were bound to apply. This
case caught my eye because your personal reaction to the claims of
the two elderly brothers seemed, quite frankly, so hostile and
really so heartless.
  The way that you reached the result and the language you used
in reaching it is very troubling. Let me read an excerpt from your
opinion. I quote, "It is neither common knowledge, nor do the
plaintiffs claim, that a weak back, poor eyesight, or angina neces-
sarily prevents an individual who can work 4 hours a day, from
working 8. The back was described as going out of joint when least
expected and there was no indication that the eyesight got worse in
the course of a day. Nor was there any testimony that the risk of
angina symptoms varied with the duration as distinguished from
the intensity of work."
  They are rather harsh words. It seems to me to be remarkable
that these two brothers were working at all, quite frankly. [Laugh-
ter.]
  But you seem to be questioning their willingness or their refusal
to work harder. And one of the legal reasons you gave for rejecting
their claim was that they had not properly raised them in the
State commission hearing. They did not have a lawyer there, of
course.
  Isn't that rather a technical and excessively legalistic ruling? I
mean, why couldn't you just have simply sent the case back to the
State agency for a fair hearing of their claims?
  Judge SOUTER. There are three things, I think, that I should say
in response to that, Senator. The first is one upon which I do not
have a sufficiently detailed recollection to say a great deal. But I
believe my recollection is correct that when that case first came
before us for review, we found what had happened in the lower ad-
ministrative tribunals sufficiently unclear that we sent it back
with an opportunity to modify what had been done or to clarify the
record in some way. And if my recollection is correct, this case had
come back to us, in effect, a second time.
  The second thing is, is there something inappropriate about the
factual determination in the case? And I think that is a subject
upon which there simply cannot be a sound judgment without rec-
ognizing one thing, and that is the fact determination in this case
is a fact determination just as in the usual case of an appeal from
a trial court. It is a fact determination for the trier of fact and not
for the appellate court.
  The question is whether the trier of fact had a basis in the evi-
dence for coming to the conclusion that it did reach. So this was
not a case in which the unanimous Supreme Court was coming to
unsympathetic findings. It was a case in which the Supreme Court
was faced with the issue that it is always faced with on appeals of
                                              220

this sort. Was there an evidentiary basis upon which the finder of
fact below could have made the determination that was made?

  The third thing that I think should be said is whether there is, in
that opinion, an insufficient degree of sympathy appropriate to an
appellate court. Let me suggest to you that there are two things in
that opinion which I think belie that suggestion. The first one, and
this is the lesser of the two, in my judgment, is the fact that every-
one on the court recognized what, on behalf of myself and the
court, I tried to express, I think, at the end of the opinion--I won't
say that it is the absolutely last paragraph, but I think it is in
there somewhere--about, in fact, how admirable we believed these
two men to be.

  Here they were, at their ages, with health which was uncertain,
and yet they had worked as hard as they had and still wanted to go
on working, if they could, on a part-time basis rather than simply
giving up.

  And I remember--I don't remember the exact words that we
used, but one of the things we did not want to do was to end our
opinion without some reference to the fact that we had great re-
spect for the clients--for the petitioners before us.

  The second thing that I would suggest in determining the kind of
the willingness of the court to hear these people's claims goes to
the fact that at the end of the opinion, as you pointed out yourself,
the court did, in fact--alhough it did not feel itself obligated to do
so, it did, in fact, take up the equal protection claim and the Feder-
al claim; I think it was under the Rehabilitation Act.

  Someone said to me afterwards, if you are really going to be con-
sistent in enforcing your rules about how things must be raised,
both at the trial level and brought to you on appeal, why did you
make any comment? Why did the court make any comment on
those two points?

  There was really a two-fold answer to that. One was that at the
last level of administrative review, there had been a reference to
those points and we believed that there was some utility to be
gained by referring to it.

  The second reason is one which, in fact, is not in that opinion.
But it is one which I know the court felt, and that is we believed--
as you suggested we might be able to do, we believed on the record
before us and the law before us, we had come to the only decision
that we could come to.

  We also believed that if we said nothing about the substance of
the claims of these two brothers under the equal protection clause
and the Rehab Act, they were going to leave our court after that
case was over believing that they might very well have had a claim
on which they were entitled to win, and yet they had lost it be-
cause of some legal technicality or some technicality of the Su-
preme Court.

  And we said, basically, these are two good people; they should
not spend the rest of their lives believing that on some kind of a
legal technicality of procedure they have lost rights that they oth-
erwise would feel entitled to.

  So we went that extra step out of the way and we looked at their
claims on the merits, and I think that is reflective, not just on my
part but on the part of the entire court, of a sympathy with the
                                      221
claimants before us that was personal to them and that took into
account the respect that we felt for them.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you wrote the opinion?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, I did.
  Senator KENNEDY. And I didn't see in the file the procedure
which you referred to.
  Judge SOUTER. I don't think it is set out there, no. I am stating
that from recollection and I think my recollection is correct.
  Senator KENNEDY. Just the material that was provided does not
reflect that.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator KENNEDY. Nor in the conversation with the attorney did
he indicate that to my staff.
  Judge SOUTER. My best recollection is there has been a remand.
  Senator KENNEDY. I will have the record show whatever way and
we will try just to have that.
  As I understand, included in your opinion is that the issues on
disability and age discrimination had not been raised in a timely
fashion.
  Judge SOUTER. I believe that is correct. Frankly, the opinion is so
complex, I would have to have it before me, but I am sure you are
right.
  Senator KENNEDY. They were not raised in a timely fashion, and
I think any fair reading would indicate that it was not raised at
the time of the appeal when they were represented by a lay person.
And I think a legitimate question could have been, why not send it
back and say, the timely fashion is now, perhaps--it was not raised
by a lay person who wasn't even a lawyer--and let them bring it
up in the lower court.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think where your question, in a way, Sena-
tor, has the advantage is that--and I want to be very careful about
what I say on this because I do not recall the procedural history of
it, as I said, in any detail prior to that opinion.
  But I think that if the petitioners had said to us, we don't want
an appeal right now, what we want to do is to be able to raise
claims below which we didn't in the first instance because we
didn't have counsel, I think the court would certainly have consid-
ered seriously a request to go back.
  And the point, as I said earlier, that I simply cannot remember
because it has nothing to do with the opinion as we wrote it, is the
extent to which such a request was made before the court. The
only thing I can remember is--if I remember this correctly, I think
there was at least one remand for a clarification of the record, and
whether there was an opportunity at that time to enlarge it, I
don't remember.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would ask, Mr. Chairman, whatever
was the factual situation be made a part of the record.
  Just the final point is that the outcome of your decision effective-
ly left these two elderly persons that had been working 22 years
virtually out in the cold.
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, what left them out in the cold was a law
passed by the legislature of the State which was not unconstitu-
tional. One of the respects which the judiciary must have for the
coordinate branches of the Government is that whether we do or
                                                222

do not like or sympathize with the results that legislatures some-
times give us, if they are constitutional, they are legislative judg-
ments and they are intended to stand.

  Senator KENNEDY. But the issues about the violations of 504 of
the Age Discrimination Act which were raised by their attorney--
part of the conclusion in reading your brief is that they were not
raised in a timely manner because they were not raised when they
were represented by a lay attorney. And because they were not
raised and were not adjudicated they were left out in the cold.
Now, whether they could have been able to make that case in a
lower court or not, just the final and bottom line is that was the
end of it.

  Mr. Chairman, I have taken more than my time.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I think the record ought to
show that Judge Souter's decision was a unanimous decision, was it
not?
  Judge SOUTER. I believe it was.
  Senator THURMOND. In that case.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, we are going to end. I want to tell
you that when we come back on Monday, you don't have to worry
about my asking you any more questions along the lines I pursued.
There will be other issues, but the whole issue of privacy, I think
you and I have explored as much as we are going to be able to ex-
plore it.
  I thank you for your graciousness today and I look forward
  Senator LEAHY. What time Monday?
  The CHAIRMAN. We will reconvene Monday morning at 10 a.m.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing is adjourned.
  [Whereupon, at 5 p.m., the committee adjourned, to be recon-
vened on Monday, September 17, 1990, at 10 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO BE AS-
  SOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
  OF THE UNITED STATES

                       MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1990

                                                                   U.S. SENATE,
                                                COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in room
216, Senate Hart Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Thurmond, Hatch, Grassley, Specter, and Hum-
phrey.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  We are convened today to celebrate Judge Souter's birthday.
Happy birthday, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Mr. Chairman, that is up to you. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The judge and I had a very brief conversation
before we came in, and he indicated that whether or not he had a
happy birthday was up to me. And I told him no, that occurs in
about 2 or 3 weeks.
  Judge, you are a veteran at this process by now. When we left off
in the second round of questioning--and we will proceed, by the
way, as we have the last 2 days. I believe, Judge, it is likely that
your testimony will finish today, although we will go as long as
Senators have questions. But my inclination is, based on what I
have been told, that we will probably, Judge, be going after lunch.
But it depends on how many of my colleagues feel that there are
areas that they need to pursue.
  I hope you have been satisfied with the procedures thus far, and
we will continue as we have the first 2 days.
  With that, let's begin immediately by yielding to my colleague,
Senator Hatch from Utah, who was next in order for questioning,
and then to Senator Metzenbaum, and we will work our way down
the line.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, welcome back and happy birthday. We didn't bake
a cake, but perhaps we will let you go home after today, and that
will be even a better gift.
  Today also happens to be the 203d anniversary of the adjourn-
ment of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. It is re-
markable that the Framers designed a system of Government

                                                        (223)
                                                    224

which, with the amendment process established by article V, has
endured so long and so well.

  The genius of the Constitution is that within the specific written
limitations set forth in that document, it gives to the people,
through their elected representatives, the right to govern them-
selves. Sometimes that right is poorly exercised, but so long as it is
exercised within the Constitution's framework, only the people are
entrusted with the power to correct their own mistakes or those of
their elected representatives.

  Now, Judge, I think you demonstrated to us last week that you
are and that you will be a good listener. I am convinced of that,
and I think that is a wonderful attribute in an appellate judge, and
certainly in a Supreme Court Justice. You also demonstrated in my
view that when you join the High Court, you are going to be lis-
tened to. I think you will have immediate contributions to make to
the deliberations of your soon-to-be fellow Justices. I am convinced
of that as well.

  Now, of course, the staffs on both sides, the majority and the mi-
nority, have had the weekend to look over the transcript, and the
representatives of dozens upon dozens of special interest groups
have also gone over your earlier testimony with a fine-toothed
comb. I suppose they have all been searching for inconsistencies.
They have also looked for ways to suggest to some of us here how
we can get you to commit on issues without sounding like that is
what we are trying to do.

  You may well be asked to expand on what you said last week,
and you may be picked at over this or that particular phrase. In
my opinion, if you will continue to adhere to what you think is
right in how you answer questions put to you, or whether you
answer them at all, I think you are going to be all right.

  I h a v e had an interest in the concerns and problems with per-
sons with disabilities since before I entered the U.S. Senate. A
number of us on this committee are on the Labor and Human Re-
sources Committee. My counterpart, Senator Kennedy, is the chair-
man, and others on this committee actually are on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee. So we are always concerned about
these issues involving persons with disabilities.

  I was quite struck by your opinion in the New Hampshire Dis-
ability Rights Center case in 1988. As I understand it, the Disability
Rights Center is a nonprofit corporation that provided legal serv-
ices to poor individuals with disabilities. The group filed a petition
to expand those services to individuals with disabilities who really
are not poor.

  Now, what was the legal problem that they faced in that case?

    TESTIMONY OF HON. DAVID H. SOUTER, TO BE ASSOCIATE
    JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, the problem that they faced was a regu-
latory scheme in New Hampshire for the practice of law, which I
think probably was characteristic of what would be found in a good
many States. There were prohibitions against the practice of law in
corporate form unless all members of the corporation which would
be providing legal services were, in fact, attorneys admitted to
                                               225

practice. And the only exception to that rule was for the benefit of
corporations, legal corporations, that would be providing services to
the poor alone.

  Senator HATCH. HOW did you address that particular issue?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, we had to address it first on the level of
statutory construction to see if, in fact, the New Hampshire stat-
utes were as restrictive as they had been assumed to be. And to
make a somewhat long story short, we found that they meant what
they said.
  As a result of that, the Court was faced with a genuine first
amendment challenge based upon the right to associate exemplified
in cases like NAACP v. Button, and basically the claim that was
made was that the New Hampshire statute was unenforceable be-
cause individuals, not necessarily all lawyers, were entitled to asso-
ciate together for the purposes of advocating and, if appropriate,
litigating the constitutional rights of their members.
  The claim was that the New Hampshire statutes, in restricting
the Disability Rights Center from representing those who were not
poor in such challenges and in restricting their membership, or
purporting to do so, to those who were only lawyers, were, in fact,
infringing on the kind of associational right which the Button case
had recognized. Having confronted the issue squarely, it was, in
fact, our judgment, expressed in an opinion that I wrote, that there
was such an infringement.
  In the course of doing so, we dealt with some of the State's
claims of countervailing interests necessary for the regulation of
the practice of law, and we confronted the State's claim that, in
fact, there had not been a demonstration; that in the absence of
recognizing this associational right and without allowing the Dis-
ability Rights Center to engage in the representation that it pro-
posed to do, the State argued there had been no claim that these
people would be denied legal services entirely.
  What we recognized in the course of our own examination of the
case, and expressed in the opinion, is that this simply was not a
sufficient countervailing State purpose which was adequate to in
any way trump the first amendment claim that had been made.
We therefore recognized it. We declared the New Hampshire stat-
utes regulating and restricting the practice of law to that extent
unconstitutional, and we decreed that the Disability Rights Center
could do exactly what it proposed to do.
  Senator HATCH. I want to compliment you on it, because I think
that ruling by you showed great constitutional sensitivity.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. I think it is a very important case. And in this
case, the result was, as you have explained, that persons with dis-
abilities could get legal services from this nonprofit group, even
though those persons with disabilities were not poor.
  Judge SOUTER. They did; and I think it is probably also unques-
tionable that there is a further public benefit in a case like this. It
is the same kind of public benefit that I alluded to when I was
speaking on Friday with Senator Thurmond about the provision of
legal services in the criminal area. That is, the result of allowing
organizations like the Disability Rights Center to provide this kind
of representation is to develop a body of expertise among a seg-
                                                226

ment of the bar that we would be unlikely to see if this kind of
informal specialization were not allowed. And I think just as in the
area of the criminal law, I think in the long run there is no ques-
tion that the quality of advocacy on this subject will be better in
very practical ways as a result of what the Rights Center is doing.

  Senator HATCH. Good. Well, that decision was very heartening to
me. I want you to know that.

  In my opening statement last week, I observed that your record
in criminal cases reveals--at least to me, and I think anybody else
who reads your cases carefully--a judge who is tough on crime but
also fair when it comes to balancing the competing interests of the
public and criminal defendants. And I noted the importance of
your balanced views in this area for citizens across the country be-
cause, starting with the period under Chief Justice Earl Warren,
many feel that precarious balance has swung way over to the side
of criminals and against law enforcement agencies.

  While the Court in recent years has continuously chipped away
at some of these inventive decisions that were done under the
Warren and Burger Courts--refusing, for example, to extend here
and there the Miranda and Mapp decisions--many feel it has not
yet swung the pendulum back to the middle.

  Now, I was encouraged by your dissent in State v. Koppel. It was
a 1985 decision where you argued for upholding the constitutional-
ity of sobriety checkpoints under the State constitution. Earlier
this year, the Supreme Court basically came out exactly for your
position in upholding the constitutionality of this important police
procedure in Michigan State Police v. Sitz just in 1990. Under the
Federal Constitution, the basic constitutional issue is the same
under the New Hampshire Constitution, at issue in the Koppel
case.

  Now, does the State's interest in detecting drunk drivers out-
weigh the intrusive effect of such procedures? And you decided
that it did. Your dissenting opinion seemed to recognize the impor-
tance of the State's interest.

  I would appreciate it if you could describe your reasoning in the
Koppel case.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, as you know, I think one of the
points of common ground from which all of the parties and all of
those with strong opinions on that case begin is that when there is
a stop for a sobriety checkpoint, there is, to a very limited degree, a
search and seizure and inquiry subject to fourth amendment stand-
ards. In New Hampshire, and I daresay probably all of the State
constitutions, the stop and the inquiry is subject to regulation
under their search and seizure provisions.

  What we do not have in this kind of case is the sort of inquiry
which is exemplified by the situation in which there is a search for
evidence of prior crime, which, as you know, as a general rule must
take place under the auspices of a warrant issued by a detached
and neutral magistrate. Because at the point automobiles are asked
to pull over for a sobriety checkpoint, there simply is not the par-
ticularized knowledge about what may be found inside which would
support a warrant under the traditional probable cause standards
of the criminal law.
                                             227

  What, therefore, the court did--and what, indeed, I did in my
dissent--was to engage basically in an analysis which balanced the
State and the private interests involved to determine whether the
stop and the inquiry could be regarded as a reasonable one within
the standards applicable to search and seizures, both for State and
national purposes.

  What we are particularly concerned with in these kinds of cases
is that the discretion of the police be something other than an un-
controlled roving and inquiry covering no matter what period of
time, no matter what elements of surprised and fright. The concern
is to require a very tightly controlled discretion on the part of the
police who may engage in these sobriety checkpoints which does
not go one iota beyond what is necessary to satisfy the public inter-
est in detecting driving under the influence before a tragedy
occurs.

  What we found or what I analyzed in my dissenting opinion in
that case is that the practices there under consideration were,
indeed, consistent with the need for strict control of this kind of
discretion. The searches, the stops, were not at random. They fol-
lowed a particular set plan at the beginning. They were very short
in duration. The intrusion of the stops was comparatively minor.
And there was no discretion given to the police to go beyond what
seemed absolutely necessary to detect the one significant fact
which was of concern to them.

  The majority of the court in my case took what seemed to me a
somewhat restrictive view of the demonstration of utility that was
necessary. They were concerned that, despite the use of sobriety
checkpoints, the great majority of arrests and prosecutions for driv-
ing under the influence still eventuated from routine controls and
the kinds of police observation which, in the absence of check-
points, would bring drunken driving to their attention. As you
know from my opinion, I thought that they were taking an unduly
restrictive view of what was necessary mathematically to justify
these checkpoints.

  The third point upon which the majority and I disagreed was a
subject which I think was well raised; that is, in allowing a sobrie-
ty checkpoint like this, is the court starting down the road which
would then lead to the possibility of what I think someone de-
scribed as shopper checkpoints, whereby the police could stop any-
body on the street and look in shopping bags and so on to see
whether the merchandise in them was accompanied by a sales slip.
Was it, in other words, sort of the thin end of the wedge for water-
ing down very important fourth amendment protections?

  My response to that was that we couldn't answer that question
without attending very carefully to the kind of activity that was
under consideration. And I contrasted the activity of driving an
automobile which, simply because of the power of an automobile to
harm, was a very highly regulated activity. The machinery was
regulated; the people who operated the machinery were regulated;
they had to pass tests of competence before they would even be al-
lowed legally behind the car. And I contrasted that, as I said, with
the kind of innocent activity of shopping, which, with the exception
of things like pedestrian safety laws, is not a regulated activity.
                                                228

  I said that in judging what is reasonable, we have to take into
consideration the potential danger which the activity poses and the
State's expression of that danger by its decision to regulate or not
to regulate it. And what might, indeed, be a perfectly reasonable
inquiry in a highly dangerous and regulated activity, like driving,
would not be reasonable at all in an innocent pursuit like walking
down Main Street and doing errands. And I therefore concluded
that there was not a danger, that a sobriety checkpoint approval
under the fourth amendment was going to be taken as thin end of
the wedge for an assault on civil liberties. I think that view has
since been recognized.

  Senator HATCH. It sure has. I am also encouraged, Judge Souter,
by what I see as a reluctance on your part to reverse criminal con-
victions on the basis of strained constitutional arguments. In the
case of State v. Bruneau, a man murdered his wife--killed her and
then later confessed his crime to a friend by calling that friend
long-distance. Although the friend contacted the police, they did
not discourage the friend from taking later phone calls and report-
ing further incriminating evidence when the defendant volun-
teered.

  When the defendant later asserted that the Constitution in the
Miranda case required the reversal of his murder conviction
simply because the police had allowed him to continue his compul-
sive voluntary confessions through his friend, your court rejected
that claim. And in an opinion which you authored, you decided
that his claim was absolutely wrong.

  Could you just give us the benefit of your reasoning on that occa-
sion?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir, I will. What the case on that particular
point boiled down to was a question of whether the friend to whom
the defendant has made his admissions was, in fact, acting as an
agent of the State for the purpose of soliciting those admissions
and, of course, passing them on to the police after he had received
them. It, again, is common ground that if any criminal defendant
makes a spontaneous admission or confession to a third party, as a
general rule the third party, of course, is perfectly free to repeat
that, and the State is perfectly free to use that as a matter of evi-
dence.

  The difficulty comes when the State is using ostensible third par-
ties to make an end run about regulations on confessions under the
fifth amendment and under the sixth amendment. And the ques-
tion, therefore, in that case was: Was the friend, in effect, acting as
an agent for the State so that every activity of the friend in talking
and, indeed, in listening to the defendant should be imputed to the
State and judged as if the friend were, in fact, a police officer work-
ing on the case?

  At the time the case came to us, there was no law under the
New Hampshire Constitution on that matter. And because the de-
fendant raised both State and constitutional claims in support of
his argument that the statement should be kept out, the first task
that we had was, in effect, to read the New Hampshire Constitu-
tion to try to determine what was behind its provisions, providing
the right to counsel as well as rights against compelled self-incrimi-
nation against the defendant; and to determine whether the princi-
                                      229
pies that the New Hampshire Constitution embodied were, in fact,
being violated by the use of the friend, as it were, as a conduit for
information in this case.

  What we determined was that the test that we should employ to
determine whether an end run was being made around these con-
stitutional guarantees was to determine whether the friend should
be regarded as an agent of the police or as, in effect, a free third
party who passed things along. And the test or tests that we came
up with came down to the question: Was the friend acting at the
behest of or under some kind of a contractual arrangement with
the police so that he thought that he was doing an expected job for
them or was doing something for which they had indicated he
would receive some benefit?

  What we were doing was trying to find a basis to determine
whether there was an agency relationship. In asking those ques-
tions, we found that there was none in the case before us. We
didn't use the exact terminology that the Federal courts have used
in discussing similar issues under the national Constitution, but I
think we came down with a substantially similar standard.

  What the Federal cases ask for in these instances is whether
there was such a substantial relationship between the third party
and the police that, in fact, there should be really seen as an iden-
tity between the two of them. And applying that test, we likewise
found that there was no agency relationship in the case, and we
held that the statements had properly been admitted.

  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Judge. I have 10 or 15 minutes
left, but I am going to end it at that. I don't want to take all my
time, and I hope others won't as well.

  I just want to compliment you because you have been very forth-
right in your testimony. You have been very firm. I think you have
covered a lot of issues that have been very interesting to everybody
up here regardless of ideology or feelings. And I think you have
conducted yourself in a very, very strong and important way
during these hearings. I don't know anybody who really could see
what you have done and watched you and listened to you that
could disagree with the statement that you are incisive, you are in-
telligent, you apply the law, you really look at it carefully. You are
very sincere and dedicated to trying to do the best job that you pos-
sibly can.

  You are precisely the type of person I think ought to have this
opportunity to serve on the Supreme Court, and that is in spite of
the fact that many of those up here aren't sure what you are going
to do on these litmus test issues. I have been kind of interested
that during the Reagan and Bush administrations, some of our col-
leagues have been so concerned that they might impose litmus
tests on their nominees, which they never did. And yet I see almost
the opposite when it comes to their right to impose litmus tests.
But, to your credit, you have handled this very well, and you have,
I think, gone down that fine line and that fine road between being
candid on what you really can be and not imposing upon yourself
the obligation to vote in a certain way or to rule in a certain way
in the future because of statements you have made here on these
very, very important issues that are very difficult, and will be diffi-
cult, and will be complex and will be different, factually different
                                                230

and legally different in so many ways as you serve on the Supreme
Court.

   So I have to hand it to you. I think you have done an excellent
job, and I for one have a great deal of admiration for you.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Metzenbaum?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Souter, I join Senator Hatch in
saying I have a great deal of admiration for you also. But I also
have some reservations and some concerns, and my colleague has
mentioned some earlier hearings where litmus test questions were
asked. I would like to refresh his recollection that those on both
sides have seen fit to use litmus test questions when they deem the
occasion appropriate. I am going back to the days of Senator
Fortas' confirmation hearing, others as well, and so I guess it is
just a question of whose ox is being gored on any particular day on
whether or not we do or do not believe in litmus test questions.
  Let me proceed, however, to questions that still remain of con-
cern to this Senator. You had a discussion with Senator Grassley
that I would like to follow up on. In that discussion, you stated that
all three branches of Government are sworn to uphold the Consti-
tution; and when Congress fails to use its full authority to uphold
the Constitution, the Court is forced to resolve difficult social prob-
lems. You referred to the vacuum that is created when the issues
are not resolved elsewhere.
  Of course, in the realm of fundamental rights, the Supreme
Court has the unique obligation to interpret the Constitution and
define those rights. The first amendment rights of political protest-
ers, the fourth, fifth, and sixth amendment rights of criminal de-
fendants, the due process and equal protection rights of minorities
and women, frankly only the Supreme Court can protect those
rights, no matter how unpopular their decisions may be at times.
  Now, even though Congress has the responsibility to enact legis-
lation to address difficult social problems, you believe that the Su-
preme Court has the unique obligation to interpret the Constitu-
tion and to declare rights to be fundamental and, therefore, enti-
tled to scrutiny, as I understand your response to Senator Grassley.
Am I correct in that?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator Metzenbaum, there is, of course, no
question that the Court does have that jurisdiction and obligation.
Its obligation is constantly to search, to identify those rights which
are fundamental, and to implement them.
  In my exchange with Senator Grassley last week when I made
the remark about the constitutional vacuum, I was thinking, in
fact, of a particular example, and I don't remember now whether I
went on to that example or not. But I was thinking specifically
with reference to the 14th amendment. I thought the case of Brown
v. Board of Education was an example of what can happen, be-
cause the unusual situation in the case of the 14th amendment is
that under section 1 there are provisions which are to be applied
by the judiciary, following justiciable standards, and under section
5, Congress has its own specific enforcement power there. And as
you know, for some time before the Brown decision came down,
                                      231

there were requests and hopes that there would be legislation to
deal with the continuing problem of segregation in the schools. But
no political solution was forthcoming.

  Therefore, that is what I had in mind when I spoke of there
being a vacuum in which the responsibility to deal with a 14th
amendment problem had to be faced, and the Court rightly faced
it.

  Senator METZENBAUM. NOW, the Supreme Court--I think we both
would agree--also has the unique obligation to enforce those rights
sometimes against the will of the majority. Over the last 2 years,
the Nation has been embroiled in a debate over whether to prohib-
it flag burning as a form of political protest. Without exception,
Americans found the acts of Gregory Johnson to be detestable and
contrary to everything that we hold dear. But the Supreme Court
concluded--quite rightly, to my mind--that burning the flag is part
of the fundamental right to free speech protected by the first
amendment.

  Do you believe that the Supreme Court has the obligation to en-
force fundamental rights no matter how unpopular the cause, no
matter how repulsive the acts may be to the majority?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, there is no question about it. If that were
not the case, there would be no point in having a Bill of Rights. If
that were not the case, there would be no point in having any sub-
stantive protection for civil liberties. We would leave the entire
issue to whatever majoritarian impulse there might be at the time,
and we would have a vastly different society from the one which
the Framers of the Bill of Rights intended us to have.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Following up on that, I would like to
return to our discussion of last week as to how you would go about
deciding whether a right is fundamental. Last week, you and I dis-
cussed what is at stake for a woman in the debate over reproduc-
tive rights. You indicated that through personal experiences you
could empathize with a woman who was faced with a very diffi-
cult--very difficult--decision as to whether to terminate a preg-
nancy. And I appreciate your candor in response to my question.

  I asked those questions not because I believe that we will once
again allow women to die from botched illegal abortions, nor do I
believe that the American people would stand by for 1 minute for
putting women in jail for having abortions or for granting periodic
testing of women to determine if they have had an abortion. Even
President Bush has said he would not put women in jail.

  My point is just this: It is inconceivable that we would take these
steps in order to prevent a woman from making a decision to ter-
minate an unintended pregnancy. That is precisely why it is a fun-
damental right. It is a personal and basic freedom for a woman to
make her own reproductive choices. It is basic to her health and to
her dignity.

  In your view, are these considerations I have described an essen-
tial part of determining whether a particular right is fundamental?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, those considerations to me point exactly
to the kind of inquiry which the Court must make. As I said, in
dealing with the question of what unenumerated rights may be re-
garded as fundamental and what require a lesser standard of scru-
tiny, the courts from time to time have tried different tests. One of
                                                232

those tests was the one that is identified with Palco v. Connecticut
in which we asked whether the right in question is essential to or
comprehended by the concept of ordered liberty.

  I think I indicated that my own view of the best approach to
these problems is the one which is probably best identified with the
late Justice Harlan. Justice Harlan said that we cannot approach
these questions of weighing the value of asserted rights without an
inquiry into the history and the traditions of the American people,
in order to try to find on a historically demonstrable basis their
commitment to a set of values which either do or do not support
the claim that a particular right in question is fundamental.

  I think Justice Harlan, in taking that approach--I am convinced
that Justice Harlan in taking that approach was, in effect, asking
for a broader inquiry than we might be engaging in if we limited
ourselves to the formulation in Palco v. Connecticut, the concept of
ordered liberty, because, as was demonstrated in many other cases,
there are many limitations upon what we regard as almost garden
variety constitutional rights which still could be found in a society
which we would not say was fundamentally unjust. Do we have a
right to a jury of 6 or a jury of 12, for example?

  I think Justice Harlan, although he himself quoted the Palco for-
mulation from time to time, I think he was clearly pointing to a
broader inquiry into the history and traditions of the American
people as being the basis upon which a fundamental valuation or a
finding of no fundamental valuation should rest. And I think he
was right.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you.
  You have discussed your view that there is a right of marital pri-
vacy recognized in Griswold, and you have agreed that marital pri-
vacy is an aspect of privacy that is fundamental. What is it that
led you to conclude that marital privacy is fundamental?
  Judge SOUTER. I came to that conclusion, Senator, because, in
fact, it is a subject which has received a great deal of attention
within the courts themselves. Much has been said over the years
about the proper way to interpret cases like Meyer v. Nebraska and
Pierce v. Society of Sisters. But leaving aside the interpretive cate-
gorical problems that constitutional lawyers may come up with,
one thing that is undeniable is that going right back to the discus-
sion of those cases in the early part of this century, the courts have
recognized a kind of core of what might be called marital or family
liberty. And it has become so familiar to us that we can at least
start with that core in any inquiry about the scope of unenumerat-
ed rights or their fundamental character.
  I don't want to rest this discussion on a purely ad hominem
basis, but, of course, I have to come right back to the Justice that I
was referring to before. Justice Harlan engaged in an examination
like this, as you know, both in his own opinion in Griswold and in
the opinion that preceded that case, Poe v. Ullman. So, in a way, it
seems to me that the notion of a marital privacy and a privacy
which takes into account certain basic familial values has got to be
our starting point. I think we have plowed that ground well, and I
think we do have a secure starting point there.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I think the starting point is that marital
privacy is fundamental, and the use of contraceptives is part of
                                                    233

that fundamental aspect of marital privacy. I would ask you, Judge
Souter, could you give me an example of an aspect of marital pri-
vacy that would not be fundamental under your formulation?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, of course, I think it is very clear--again,
there is no real dispute about this, I think, among people on both
sides of this issue--that even marital privacy is not free from regu-
lation by the State. A spouse is not entitled to assault another
spouse. We do not build a sort of shield against all State intrusion.
There certainly is an example of a subject which I suppose some-
body could argue ought to be within the shield of scrutiny from
State concern, and yet I think we would all agree that that was a
reasonable subject of regulation, without which we would have an
extremely barbaric marital society.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I would agree.
  You also commented on Eisenstadt v. Baird in which the Court
recognized the right of unmarried people to use contraceptives. Jus-
tice Brennan writing for the Court in that case stated, "If the right
of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married
or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusions in
a matter so fundamentally affecting a person."

   Do you agree that unmarried people enjoy an equivalent funda-
mental right of privacy to use contraceptives as you have recog-
nized for married people?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I agree that Eisenstadt v. Baird engaged in
an appropriate analysis. I didn't go back and reread it this week-
end. I probably should have. But my recollection from reading Ei-
senstadt is that the case rested primarily on an equal protection
analysis; and that having found in the Griswold case as they did,
the Court then felt it was appropriate to apply an equal protection
criterion going beyond the express due process concepts that they
had come up with in Griswold. And I think there is no question
that the area of privacy is not immune to this kind of equal protec-
tion analysis any more than any other subject of the law is.

   Senator METZENBAUM. May I conclude from that that your
answer would be in the affirmative, that unmarried people do
enjoy a fundamental right of privacy to use contraceptives in the
similar manner that you have recognized their right to use them?

  Judge SOUTER. I would just like to enter this caveat: that because
I have not reread Eisenstadt v. Baird, there may be some things in
there that I am just not adverting to. But on the basic proposition
that I refer to, the equal protection analysis based on the point at
which Griswold left off, I would see no basis to approach the prob-
lem differently.

   The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield on that for a second?
   Senator METZENBAUM. Yes.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU very rightly and skillfully, Judge, always
refer to the equal protection aspect of that case, which was not the
basis upon which Griswold was decided. What would have hap-
pened had Eisenstadt come before the Court before Griswold, so
that there was not an equal protection portion to it?
  Do you believe that there is a constitutional right to privacy in
the liberty clause of the 14th amendment, not the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment for unmarried couples?
                                                234

  Judge SOUTER. I don't know the extent an answer to that ques-
tion can be given in the abstract without the kind of Harlan in-
quiry that I'm talking about. It was not made and I have not made
it. The thing that I can say is that if that question had come up
before Griswold as you posit, exactly the same kind of analysis that
Harlan would have used and did use in his concurring opinion
should be used to address the same issue of nonmarital privacy.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is worrisome, because I know of no tradi-
tion in American society where an inquiry into the history and tra-
ditions of the American people have guaranteed a right of privacy
to unmarried couples relating to procreation or sexual activity. So
it seems to me that you would have come down and concluded that
married couples do not have a right to privacy, based on that set of
inquiry.

  Am I wrong about that?
  Judge SOUTER. I think, yes, I think it is wrong simply to draw
that conclusion because as you, yourself, have pointed out in the
analyses that go on, there is a two-part inquiry. The first inquiry is
No. 1: Is there a liberty interest to be asserted and how may it be
valued? The other inquiry that goes on is, when, in fact, is the
weight to be given to the State interest which may be brought up
as a countervailing interest when the liberty interest is, in some
way, restricted?
  One of the questions, of course, that would have to be asked if we
were approaching Eisenstadt first and not Griswold first, is not
merely the weight to be given to the privacy interest to be asserted,
but the weight to be given to the State interest in asserting the
right to preclude people under those circumstances from obtaining
contraceptive information and devices. I do not think that is a
simple question to answer.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank my colleague and I will be happy to yield
time from my time, when the time comes.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Souter, to change the area of inter-
est, historically the commerce clause of the Constitution has been
the source of congressional power to enact nationwide economic
and social welfare legislation. Labor laws, health and safety legisla-
tion, environmental laws, civil rights statutes are just a few of the
many laws rooted in the commerce power.
  In 1918, a national child labor law was struck down as an invalid
exercise of the constitutional power under the commerce clause. In
the early years of the Depression much of President Roosevelt's
New Deal legislation was invalidated by the Court on commerce
clause grounds. The tide turned in 1937 in the Jones & Laughlin
Steel case. In that case, the Court upheld the validity of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act against a commerce clause challenge.
  Since 1937, the Court has broadly construed congressional power
under the commerce clause and has rarely, if ever, invalidated leg-
islation under commerce clause grounds. On Thursday you stated
in response to Senator Thurmond that, "The commerce power has
grown to and has been recognized as having a plenary degree
which would probably have astonished the Founders."
  Are you troubled by the scope of the commerce power exercised
by Congress and do you have any doubts or qualms about the
                                      235
breadth of congressional authority under the commerce clause as it
has been interpreted by the courts since 1937?

  Judge SOUTER. No. I do not have a concern to raise about it at
this point, Senator. What I was referring to, I think, in my re-
marks to Senator Thurmond, was probably an historical fact. It il-
lustrates something in our constitutional history which is not just
confined to the commerce clause. That is the sense of State auton-
omy which doubtless motivated the Framers, I think, probably got
a jolt as early as the tenure of John Marshall when it came to com-
merce clause analysis.

  I think many of the Framers probably had not thought through
the generality of the grant of power which Marshall recognized so
early in our history. I think this phenomenon is probably paral-
leled in another example that we have been talking about in the
course of these hearings and that is the effect of the powers grant-
ed to the courts, and indeed, to the Congress under the 14th
amendment.

  I remember in our discussion the other day about the appropri-
ateness of Brown as a decision. We all agreed, I think, that histori-
cally none of the Framers of the equal protection clause would
have had the slightest inkling that that clause was ever going to be
applied to school desegregation. They doubtless would not have had
the slightest inkling that that clause was going to be applied to sex
discrimination.

  Yet, the fact is they wrote a clause of great generality which
they did not confine to the specific objects which they had in mind
or had contemplated when they passed it. Therefore, as I was
saying last week, the legitimacy of the application of the equal pro-
tection clause to school desegregation, to gender discrimination,
and so on seems to me beyond argument.

  I think probably historically the same phenomenon has gone on
with the commerce clause. They wrote more generally than they
probably intended by way of application at the time that they
wrote it, but they wrote what they wrote.

  Senator METZENBAUM. SO actually, you are saying that those who
would look to strict constructionism and original intent would have
to move forward 200-and-some odd years in order to understand the
Supreme Court interpretations of the commerce clause in today's
world?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, that is true. I would repeat something that I
have said before, but I don't want to leave any mistake on this.

  My approach to interpretation is not a specific intent approach.
The approach has got to take into consideration the text of the pro-
visions in question and it is not to be confined, the meaning of that
text is not to be confined by reference simply to the specific appli-
cations that may have been, as it were, in the mind either individ-
ually or institutionally of the people who proposed the amendment.

  We are looking, when we look for the original meaning, we are
looking for meaning and for principle. We are not confining our-
selves simply to immediately intended application.

  Senator METZENBAUM. NOW, in the 1976 brief on EEOC regula-
tions, which has been a subject of questioning by Senator Kennedy,
your office took the position that regulations designed to help
battle discrimination in the private sector were an unconstitutional
                                                236

exercise of congressional authority to regulate interstate com-
merce.

  Is it your view today?
  Or I guess I would ask you, in view of your previous answers, do
you think that that same kind of position would be the one you
would be taking were you the attorney general of the State of New
Hampshire in today's world, in view of more recent Supreme Court
decisions?
  Judge SOUTER. Absolutely not.
  Senator METZENBAUM. In the mid-1960's, Congress passed nation-
al legislation designed to end segregation in public accommoda-
tions. The legislation was challenged on commerce clause grounds.
In Katzenbach v. McClung the argument was made that Congress
had no authority to combat segregation in local restaurants be-
cause the effect on interstate commerce was too remote.
  Do you think there is any validity to that argument?
  Judge SOUTER. I don't think in view of the understanding of the
commerce powers you, yourself, have said since the late 1930's,
since the NLRB, I don't think there is. I recall the analysis in
McClung and it came down to a straight factual analysis. That is,
would the segregation, if it were permitted in these accommoda-
tions have an effect on the flow of goods in interstate commerce;
would it have an effect on the movement of people in interstate
commerce?
  The Court, as you know, had no difficulty in concluding that it
would have such effects, and therefore, that it was within the
power of the, within the scope of the commerce power for Congress
to regulate.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me switch the area of inquiry for a
bit. I think over the weekend a number of your responses have
been of concern to me and I have been thinking about them. I
think the exchange you had with Senator Heflin concerning the
Seabrook demonstration is probably as troubling to me as are some
of the other issues.
  That involves this $74,000 contribution from the owner of the
plant, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, to help defray
some of the law enforcement expenses.
  What bothers me is how far down the road can you go with that
kind of a concept? When a labor union is on one side, and manage-
ment is on the other, can a State start to think well which one is
going to be willing to help us defray the expenses and don't you get
to that conclusion when there is an environmental issue?
  Don't you have that kind of contrast? When you have an abor-
tion issue, whether or not it is closing down or picketing or what-
ever the case may be, unlawful conduct in front of an abortion
center? I am so disturbed about the fact that when the State or
public body accepts money from a private litigant.
  Now, you actually testified that the $74,000 contribution was
made in order to offset the extra law enforcement expenses for the
weekend of the demonstration. You also suggested that because the
contribution arrived in late June, over a month after both the dem-
onstration and your appearance in court, it did not raise any prob-
lems of propriety.
                                                237

  I might say I would take strong exception to that but let's pass
on because the facts are a little different. You also stated that if
there was any particular appeal to the Public Service Company it
was something that had nothing to do with me or my office.

  Now, talking about the purpose of the $74,000 contribution and
the date that it arrived, you suggested that you knew nothing
about it until June. But on Friday, May 13, 1977, the last 500 of the
1,400 demonstrators who were arrested were released from the Na-
tional Guard Armory pending appeal after having been found
guilty of criminal trespass.

  Two days later, on May 15, the Manchester Union Leader report-
ed that, "Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the prime
backer of the Seabrook plant has contributed more than $74,000 to
the State to help pay the costs of prosecuting and detaining the
protesters, and officials of the firm have said another contribution
will be given."

  Now this account suggests that the contribution was given at a
much earlier time than you indicated. It also states the contribu-
tion went toward the "costs of prosecuting the protesters" and you
testified that on Tuesday--well, let me just get to that point. Is
that Manchester Union account accurate and it does change the
picture somewhat as to learning about it in June, but even learn-
ing about it in June does give me some concern. I wonder if you
would respond to that, Judge?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes. In fact, I would like, if I may, Senator, re-
spond to a couple of the specific points you made.

  Let me start, of course with that one. When I went back to check
on this when the subject first came up, the only record that I could
find--to begin with, I didn't recall the contribution at all--but the
only record that I could find was the record of the action by the
Governor and Council which I think was on June 30, when they
had accepted or had on their agenda to accept the contribution of
around 70-or-74-whatever it was, thousand dollars from the Public
Service Company.

  I had not been aware of the Manchester Union Leader report on
May 15, and you have seen a copy of the paper and I am sure
that's accurate.

  The report was something I was not aware about, until you just
told me now. But I think going to the issues of substance that you
raise, I think there are two particular points that I do want to em-
phasize.

  The first is that at no time did I engage in a solicitation of the
Public Service Company or, indeed, of anyone else, except the New
Hampshire Legislature for funds to defray the costs of the law en-
forcement work and the prosecution.

  The request for those funds that were made came, as I recall and
I think as has been reported here, from the Governor. The only
consultation that I had with him that I have any recollection of is
my preparation to go to the legislature, as I said, to ask for funds.

  I can state categorically that the Public Service Company had no
consultation with me about what would be an appropriate response
by me as a prosecutor or by what would be appropriate policy for
me as a prosecutor in appearing before the courts. There was no
                                      238
consultation, there was no message going back and forth, and I
would not have tolerated one.

   I made the decisions that I made based on what I thought were
evenhanded law enforcement criteria, considering, among other
things, other cases of civil disobedience which had been prosecuted,
particularly in the State of New Hampshire in recent years.

   So, there was no opportunity and there was, in fact, no influence
by the Public Service Company or by any other contributor of
funds to the State of New Hampshire, in my position as attorney
general.

  The second thing that I think it is important to say is something
which you rightly raise, and that is when the State, regardless of
who solicits the money, when the State receives funds in a case
like this from what might be regarded as a party in interest, two
dangers arise and they simply cannot be divorced from those situa-
tions.

  The first danger is that we are starting down the road, not as a
particular attorney general's office which may not have been in-
volved in it, but simply as a State, we are starting down the road of
dependence upon people with particular interests in the specific
subjects of law enforcement, which would tend to give them an op-
portunity for an influence which they should not have.

  The second concern is related to the first, and that is whether
particular parties or groups in interest do exert that kind of influ-
ence. When funds are accepted in this manner, there is a risk of an
appearance that they would have had this influence

  Senator METZENBAUM. The appearance of impropriety is what
concerns me.

  Judge SOUTER. And the appearance that justice can be deflected
by this should be avoided. If I had been consulted as to whether or
not these funds should be accepted or, indeed, solicited, if there was
any specific solicitation, I trust that my answer would have been
no, for exactly that reason.

  Senator METZENBAUM. DO you not think you had a responsibility,
when you learned about it, to say to Governor Thomson, I insist
that the funds be returned, because it gives the appearance of im-
propriety, they were not a factor in the case, taking their money
does not look right, and I insist, as the attorney general of the
State, that that money be returned, otherwise it might appear to
some that our integrity has been compromised?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes; I think that would have been an appropriate
position to take and I wish I had taken it.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me just go one more point about this
question of whether you knew or did not know, and I appreciate
your agreeing that that would have been the appropriate conduct.

  In a civil action brought by some of the Seabrook protesters, As-
sistant Attorney General James Cruz, who participated in the Sea-
brook prosecution effort, was deposed. We do not have Mr. Cruz's
entire deposition, but one portion which we do have indicates that
Mr. Cruz testified that, on Tuesday, April 26, 1977--now, that is
several days, 4 days before the demonstration--there was a meet-
ing in the Governor's office to discuss the upcoming protest at Sea-
brook. Do you recall if you attended that meeting?
                                         239

  Judge SOUTER. I am almost certain that I did not. I did not go
through the preprotest meetings. The deputy attorney general did,
Mr. Cruz did, so I am reasonably certain I was not at that meeting.

  Senator METZENBAUM. According to the transcript, Mr. Cruz tes-
tified that, "During the meeting with the Governor, a couple of
things came up. One was the possibility that the Public Service
Company would be paying some of the bill for the law enforcement
at the site."

  Now, on Friday, you testified that, "If there was any particular
appeal to the Public Service Company, it was something that had
nothing to do with me or my office." But Mr. Cruz, a member of
your office, testified that, 4 days before the protest and the arrests
occurred, he was in a meeting in which a contribution from the
Public Service Company apparently was being considered by the
Governor. Did he inform you that such a plan was being consid-
ered?

  Judge SOUTER. I can only say that I have no recollection of it
whatever.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Were you aware of his testimony about
the April 26 meeting, the deposition?

  Judge SOUTER. NO; I had not seen his deposition, again, until you
referred to it now.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I will
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, may I--I am sorry.
  Senator METZENBAUM. GO ahead.
  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry. I was going to say, I think in one re-
spect I just misspoke inadvertently. I said I did not see his deposi-
tion again. I am not sure that I have ever read his deposition.
   Senator METZENBAUM. I think your recognition that there was
not an appearance of impropriety and that probably if you had it
to do over again, you would have told him to give the money back.
I think I understood your answer to be to that effect.

  Judge SOUTER. We learn as we go along.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Pardon?
  Judge SOUTER. I say we learn as we go along.
  There is one other thing, if I may, that I would like to add, not
because I think I said anything that gave a contrary impression,
but I think it should be put on the record, and that is that, in this
kind of maelstrom of events surrounding the Seabrook protest. At
no time, did Governor Thomson ever tell me what he wanted to do,
as a matter of law enforcement, with the protesters.

  Despite his feistiness and his assertiveness, he was in this in-
stance, and I think in our general relationship, he was respectful of
my role as attorney general, and at no point did he tell me I think
you ought to recommend this or recommend that. That issue was
left to me, and the Governor was very careful to do that.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I do not suggest that your judgment was
compromised. I do suggest and maintain that the appearance of im-
propriety is self-evident, when one side in a matter of that kind is
permitted to pay part of the legal costs in the State. It should
never occur. I think now you agree.

  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.

  Now, Senator Simpson is next, but he, in his leadership position,
is over on the floor of the Senate, so what we are going to do is go
to Senator Grassley, and then when it is Senator Grassley's turn,
we will go to Senator Simpson.

  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, I would like to return to the dialog that we had last
Friday morning, and as I review the transcript from Friday morn-
ing, I am quite comfortable with most of your responses on the role
of a Justice, as one who must be every bit as constrained by the
law and the Constitution as we are. I appreciated your statements
about having to guard against at all times the temptation to be a
knight errant, when dealing with the majestic generalities of the
law, and also where you spoke of having to resist the urge to sub-
stitute your own values or morality for those of the people's repre-
sentative. Finally, you spoke not just in terms of liberty, but also
ordered liberty.
  All of this is, I think, in the best traditions of judicial restraint
practiced by Holmes and Harlan--two Justices that you say that
you admire. However, you mentioned, not just once but three or
four times, a concept that I have never detected in any of your
opinions or in any of your testimony up until this point. In fact, as
it hit me on Friday, it seems to me more the terminology likely to
come from a judicial activist.
  Specifically, you spoke of courts "filling vacuums," of courts--
and these are your words from page 14--"forced to take on prob-
lems which sometimes might better be addressed by the political
branches of government." To be candid, I am a little troubled by
this vacuum concept, because if we are going to have a Supreme
Court that thinks it can fill vacuums every time there is a per-
ceived problem, then I have to agree with my colleague here on my
right, Senator Specter, that you are going to be a very busy person,
because democratic self-government does not always move with the
speed or the consensus or the wisdom of philosopher kings who
might best fill those vacuums.
  I think Senator Specter is also right, that if you think that you
have a warrant to fill vacuums, then you are coming dangerously
close to acting like a politician, and then that means that coming
before this forum, we have a right as well as a responsibility to see
your whole "campaign platform" on a wide array of issues.
  Now, I do not want that and I do not think you want that, and I
do not think this confirmation process could stand that. Therefore,
would you please clarify the use of the term "vacuum" or, even
better, rephrase it in favor of something different? [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. I think you are giving me a hint, Senator. [Laugh-
ter.]
  I certainly do not want to start my answer by saying that the
last thing in the world I would want to be taken for is a politician.
[Laughter.]
  But I think I had better go back, as I did a moment ago, to the
specific context that I had in mind when I made that statement.
Let me start it with a couple of general thoughts.
  The first is that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
United States, of the lower Federal courts, of every State court in
                                      241

America is derived from the Constitutions that respectively create
those courts. It is not derived from perceptions at the moment
about what ought to be done.

  Courts do not self-define their jurisdictions and they do not have
the authority to define them simply when they perceive what they
think is a vacuum in the political process which leaves a problem
unsolved.

  What I had in mind when I made that statement was the exam-
ple of the 14th amendment example in Brown. There are a great
many who argued at the time and certainly have argued since that
we might have been better off if the Brown decision had been not
that of the Supreme Court, but had been the

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me interrupt, before you get too far down
that road. Are you saying that the power given to Congress under
the 14th amendment, clause 5, can be usurped by the Supreme
Court?

  Judge SOUTER. Certainly not. The Supreme Court's action in the
Brown case was derived from the fact that it was charged with en-
forcing the Constitution, including the provisions of section 1 of the
14th amendment, not section 5. Section 5 is an empowerment of
the Congress alone.

  But the situation that was presented to the American populace
at that time was a situation in which Congress could have taken
some action and which the courts, acting under section 1, had a re-
sponsibility to take some action.

  The fact was that for 58 years, separate but equal was the law of
the United States, and no political branch of the Government re-
sponded to modify that, including the Congress under its section 5
power, and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Supreme Court,
when Brown v. Board of Education came down, to apply the equal
protection clause as it thought right, and in my judgment, as I
have said, I think there is no question, it applied it correctly.

  But there is an example of a case, and that is the one that I had
in mind, in which there had been no action by the political
branches and, therefore, sooner or later, there was no question that
a justiciable issue would be brought before the Court and that the
Court would say the time has come to act upon it.

  But let me leave no mistaken impression in your mind that the
jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court to act in that case had noth-
ing whatsoever to do, one way or the other, with what any other
branch of the Government did or did not do. The Court's jurisdic-
tion derived from the Constitution and from its obligation to apply
section 1 of the 14th amendment, and vacuums do not create juris-
diction.

  Senator GRASSLEY. If you are saying that when a State fails to
live up to what the 14th amendment says, in terms of equal protec-
tion and due process, that the Court can step in, then that is fine.
But if you mean that the Court can otherwise fill vacuums, that is
another thing.

  Judge SOUTER. NO; the former is exactly what I mean.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Therefore, you do not read the 14th amend-
ment as a kind of admonishment to Congress to solve all social
problems, because if we do not, then the Supreme Court will step
in and solve them for us?
                                               242

  Judge SOUTER. No. Section 5 of the 14th amendment empowers
Congress to implement the provisions of the amendment itself and,
as you know, Congress is moving these days to do exactly that.

  Senator GRASSLEY. SO, the 14th amendment, then, is not some
kind of loaded revolver just sitting around waiting to be fired by
the Supreme Court any time you become impatient with the peo-
ple's representatives?

  Judge SOUTER. I assure you, I would not regard it in that light.
[Laughter.]

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I also asked you about the criticism of
the Court's creating rights inconsistent with the text and tradition
of the Constitution, and you responded, on pages 17 and 18, with a
discussion of the differences between the creation of rights and the
recognition of rights which are implicit in the text of the Constitu-
tion.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Judge GRASSLEY. This answer came right on the heels of your
talking about filling vacuums, when the people's branches or the
political branches of Government might be slow to act, so I would
like some elaboration. Please give me an example of when you
think the Supreme Court improperly created rights and one when
you think they properly recognized rights.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I do not want to over-use the example, but I
think I cannot give a better example on the proper recognition of
rights than Brown itself. The Court in that case recognized that the
equal protection provisions of the 14th amendment were not con-
fined to those specific problems that were in the minds of the
Framers as the objects of its application in 1868. The Court recog-
nized that there was as general concept of equal protection and it
was just as applicable to school segregation as to other enterprises.
  If you simply read the text of the Constitution and somebody
said, well, where does it refer to schools, where does it refer to
school desegregation, of course, you would not have found anything
there, but I think clearly implicit in the text of the Constitution
itself and in the concept of due process was the proper basis for the
Court's exercise of its jurisdiction.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, is it not more true under Brown that
the Court was striking down a State practice, rather than creating
a right
  Judge SOUTER. Well, in order to
  Senator GRASSLEY [continuing]. A nonconstitutional practice by
the State of Kansas?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, in so doing, the Court had to recognize and
did recognize that the right under section 1 of the 14th amend-
ment, the right to the equal protection of the laws, was a right
which applied to those particular plaintiffs and applied to the sub-
ject of school desegregation. So, in order to strike down the State
laws, what the Court had to do was to recognize the right of the
plaintiffs, in effect, to strike them down or to have them struck
down. So, I think it was doing both, but in order to do so, it had to
recognize the plaintiffs right.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, let me see where I can help you--where
you may think that the courts improperly created rights. You have
great respect for Harlan and referred to him quite regularly during
                                               243

these hearings. Harlan, and hopefully you, would think that the
Warren court rulings in the areas of criminal procedure or in ob-
scenity might be some cases where the courts created rights.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, take the criminal procedure area as an ex-
ample. I think so much of the difficulty that the States had with
some of the Warren court decisions came in part, came in large
measure from the difficulty of administering them. One could, I
suppose, perfectly well argue today--as many people argued in the
1960's--that there was not a warrant to impose the exclusionary
rule, for example, on the States once it was understood that the
fourth amendment standards applied to the States.

  But the difficulty that the States had under the exclusionary
rule--and I can speak from experience here because I was in the
trenches in those days. I was an assistant attorney general, and I
was concerned with criminal administration. The difficulty that
the States were having was the difficulty in learning how to do
what the Court had held that the States ought to be doing.

  I can remember in those days lecturing at State police training
academies on the requirements to demonstrate in applications for
search warrants what was known as credibility and reliability of
the sources of information, what people in the business refer to as
the old twin Aguilar-Spinelli tests.

  It was very difficult for law enforcement officers and for judges
in the field to engage in the kind of very close textual analysis
almost of search warrant applications which seemed to be called
for by Aguilar and Spinelli. A great many of those difficulties have
been alleviated in the meantime as the Court has moved from the
kind of the technicality of those two-pronged tests to a test which
looks rather to the overall effect of the warrant and does not rely
on that kind of technicality.

  The difficulty that we were having was the difficulty in under-
standing exactly what it was that the Court was requiring and how
to go about satisfying it. One of the most telling experiences that I
can remember having that illustrates this point was in the course
of an argument in the Supreme Court of New Hampshire after the
Spinelli case had come down. One of the justices on the New
Hampshire Supreme Court said to me, "Do you believe that Spin-
elli has changed the law?" I said, "No, I don't." I said, "I think the
standards are the same after Spinelli as they were before."

  And he said, "Well, that is my view, too, but," he said, "you
know, not everybody agrees with us." And if you looked at the
opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court in the Spinelli case, you would
see, as I recall, that the Justices themselves could not agree on
whether they were coming up with anything new in the Spinelli
case or not. And that is why I say I think the great difficulties that
we labored under some of the Warren decisions was in implement-
ing them, in trying to understand what they meant, and that is
why I think I said the other day that in the meantime we have
learned to live with a great deal, and lived with them pretty well
today.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Has there never been an occasion where the
Court improperly created rights? And these were your words from
last Friday. What did you mean by "improperly created rights?"
                                                  244

  Judge SOUTER. Going to the latter part of your question, I think
what I was referring to on last Thursday were the--I think we
were talking--I don't know, but I think we were talking about the
area of criminal procedure again. A lot of the decisions in that
period were what I would describe as kind of pragmatic implement-
ing decisions. I think probably everyone would agree that the Court
could have gone on reviewing confessions simply on the basis of the
voluntariness standard which was implicit in the concept of due
process, which the Court had been doing for some time; and that it
could have continued to do that without adopting the Miranda
tests.

  What the Miranda tests were were intended to be a very prag-
matic procedure that would cut down on the likelihood, cut down
on the degree of possibility that confessions actually would turn
out to be involuntary confessions. Was it right for the Court to say
we have just reached the point where the judicial system cannot
continue to go on litigating every case for voluntariness under due
process? We have got somehow to have a more pragmatic approach
to this that is going to cut down on the number of problems.

  People of good will could disagree about that, but the fact is, at
the time the Miranda decision came down, it created a lot of prob-
lems for people who didn't know how to respond to it. Those prob-
lems are over and done with today. I think most law enforcement
officers can respond to it, and anyone who wants to attack Miran-
da today has got, I think, the same kind of pragmatic burden
which those had who argued for Miranda in the first place. What
would be the effect of changing it? Was Miranda the creation of a
new right, or was Miranda, in fact, an experiment by the Supreme
Court in how to protect a right?

  People can argue back and forth on the terminology. I personally
have looked at Miranda as a pragmatic decision intended to protect
a right, and the only sense in which I think probably you can say
there was an extension of a right was that sense which Justice
Harlan referred to when he said that what Miranda had done was
to extend the fifth amendment from the courtroom to the police
station. But I think the reason the Court was taking the tack that
it was taking was not merely for the purpose, or for the purpose of
extending rights so much as in trying to find a pragmatic way to
protect those rights. And it was a very difficult pragmatic way at
the time the opinion came down, unlike the situation today.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Souter, you have said many times and
again in your last statement about your admiration for the philoso-
phy and the approach of Justice Harlan. If there is one Harlan
message that I would like to leave with you as I conclude my dialog
with you, it is this one from the reapportionment cases of 1964, and
I quote:

  I believe that the vitality of our political system on which, in the last analysis, all
else depends is weakened by reliance on the judiciary for political reform. In time, a
complacent body politic will result.

  Continuing the quote:

  These decisions give support to a current mistaken view of the Constitution and
the constitutional function of this Court. This view, in a nutshell, is that every
major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle, and
that this Court should take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of
                                         245

Government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the
public welfare, nor should this Court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as a
haven for reform movements. The Constitution is an instrument of Government,
fundamental to which is the premise that in the diffusion of governmental authority
lies the greatest promise that this Nation will realize liberty for all its citizens. This
Court does not serve its highest purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satis-
fy the justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process.

  Now, this to me is classic John Marshall Harlan. Whether or not
you would have signed on to his dissent in 1964 is immaterial be-
cause, of course, there is no turning back the clock in this area. My
point is simply that Harlan has articulated a principle that, it
seems to me, leaves no room for vacuum-filling. So I commend that
particular bit of Harlan for you to reread and consider as you move
to those lonely marble halls just a few blocks from here.

  Thank you, and I wish you good luck.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I yield back my time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, was one-person, one-vote, rightly decided,
Baker?
  Judge SOUTER. I think it was. But I will tell you, Mr. Chairman, I
think the Harlan dissent was a very powerful dissent. And the
truth is I don't have a simple answer to the Harlan dissent. I don't
have a simple answer to it today.
  As you know, Justice Harlan relied so heavily on the provisions
of section 2 of the 14th amendment for saying that that was an in-
dication that any problem of the maldistribution of votes or the ap-
portionment of votes was intended to have a congressional solution
period. And yet on the other side, you would be facing the fact that
there was less protection for this most fundamental right than
there would have been for one of the garden variety economic
rights. And that argument of his was a tough argument.
  The CHAIRMAN. But you think it was rightly decided.
  Judge SOUTER. I think I would have to have gone along with it,
yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Arizona, Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
  Judge Souter, I want to go back to a couple of areas that we dis-
cussed last week. Excuse my voice. I have a bit of a cold today. We
talked at some length about the equal protection clause as it re-
lates to discrimination cases.
  In your opening statement, Judge, you stated that part of your
role as Supreme Court judge will be to "preserve the Constitution
for the generations that will follow." I think that statement is very
accurate, and it is the reason why I have spent so much time on
this particular issue.
  Judge Souter, I have two daughters. One is a lawyer, one is a
doctor. I have a son who is a lawyer. I see no reason why my son
should be treated any better under the law than my two daughters.
I also see no reason why the Court should give the same scrutiny to
law that distinguished trucks or automobiles as it does a law that
treats men different than women. To do otherwise, in my judg-
ment, I believe would not preserve the Constitution for generations
to follow.

          39-454--91 9
                                                246

  Along that line, Judge, let me just pursue this a little more. Last
week, we discussed the middle tier scrutiny that the Court applies
to gender discrimination statutes. You described it to Senator Ken-
nedy as "too loose"--those were your words, I believe--and you
criticized its flexible quality.

  Could you refer to any cases that you have analyzed that lead
you to believe that the test may be too loose?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I think I can recall some. That test
has a peculiar history. To the best of my knowledge, the first case
in which the middle-tier scrutiny test, substantial relationship to
important government objective, the first case in which that was
mentioned was a case early in the century, and it was an economic
regulation case. It may have been an antitrust case. It was an eco-
nomic regulation case, in any event, and one of the parties was a
corporation known as the Royster Guano Co. I don't remember the
other party, but I will never forget Royster Guano.

  The issue in that case, as I said, was strictly one of economic reg-
ulation. It is the kind of issue which today would merit what we
would call first-tier, rational basis analysis. And, in fact, that was
exactly the kind of treatment that Royster Guano got. So this test
which today is being used and has evolved into a middle-tier test
began its life right down at the other end of the spectrum.

  Some of the cases that have applied it as a middle-tier test even
since then have seemed to me, as I have read the opinions, to seem
to slide back and forth as to whether they were applying middle-
tier or first-tier. I think someone the other day mentioned the case
of Reed v. Reed, which involved an issue of probate administration
and the eligibility of a woman to serve under the same conditions
or subject to the same conditions of eligibility as a man. There are
portions of the Reed opinion in which they seem to be doing noth-
ing but applying first-tier analysis.

  Senator DECONCINI. I agree.
  Judge SOUTER. And at the other end of the spectrum, I had a
case in which I wrote a separate opinion on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court this past year in which I know my colleagues did
not agree with me, but it seemed to me that they were using the
middle-tier test for the highest level of scrutiny. And so it is exam-
ples like that that have made me wish that we could come up with
a less flexible formulation. That is a lot easier said than done. I
hope you are not going to say to me, "OK, Judge, here is your
chance, give us the word," because I don't have an alternative for-
mulation written.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, maybe not, and maybe you could
pursue it a little bit. If the intermediate test requires that a classi-
fication must serve--as we, I think, agree--"an important govern-
mental objective" and be substantially related to that objective--
you went into at great length last week. And yet the strict scrutiny
test provides a classification of compelling government interest and
the narrowest means must be used to achieve that objective or in-
terest.
  Now, what in your opinion is "too loose," or can you discuss the
difference between these two? I have trouble with them, but I un-
derstand the strict scrutiny test much better than I do the interme-
diate and where it follows with your reference to the looseness. I
                                                247

tend to agree. It is interesting to me how you see the difference be-
tween this. Where is the looseness? And where would you tighten
it up, if you can say, obviously without any reference to potential
pending cases?

  Judge SOUTER. I think the reason why we tend not to be quite so
concerned about the flexibility in the highest tier test, the compel-
ling State interest test, is that traditionally we have been working
with classifications which affected rights of such fundamental im-
portance that it was very, very difficult for anybody to meet the
test. Therefore, there has tended, I think, just as a historical
matter, to be fewer cases calling for third tier, the highest level of
scrutiny, which have seemed to be debatable cases at all. And you
are entirely right to say, well, compelling interest, that calls for an
evaluation. Narrowly tailored, that calls for it. And you are entire-
ly right. If you look at some of the recent cases that have come
down on examining race-conscious remedial order by courts. They
are being subject to the highest level of scrutiny.

  Senator DECONCINI. Exactly.
  Judge SOUTER. And yet, for example, when you come down to
narrow tailoring, there is undoubtedly room for maneuvering there
in the kind of factor analysis that has gone into the narrowly tai-
loring analysis.
  Senator DECONCINI. It doesn't trouble you that you would make
that statement, that there is room for maneuvering?
  Judge SOUTER. It is a fact. There is no human formulation that is
going to give you any kind of mathematical precision. And as I
think I said when I first brought up the subject the other day, I am
by no means convinced that I can do better at it. But the examples
that we have been through, of which I gave you some
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, you did.
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. Are what disturbed me.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, to go to another area, last week we
talked a little bit about the effects opinion polls should have on
judges' decisions, and you stated that they should have no effect. In
some eighth amendment cases, dealing with the death penalty, the
Court has looked to many diverse factors in determining "evolving
standards of decency," including opinion polls. That is made refer-
ence to in the Gregg case. Do you think that the Court erred in
making reference to public opinion polls, in deciding the Gregg
case? There are several other cases that judges' majority opinions
have made reference to opinion polls.
  Judge SOUTER. I was referring to opinion polls about the right-
ness of their decisions or not.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. And I will stand by my answer there.
  I will say that I would be much more comfortable to look to what
legislatures do, for example, in expressing the sense of the commu-
nities on matters of appropriate criminal penalties.
  So I would look at them very warily because I think we have
better evidence.
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, I agree with that and it seems like it's
maybe unfair to even suggest that a Supreme Court Justice can
really be so pure in his or her legal thinking that they are not
                                          248

going to be influenced by newspaper articles or television opinion
polls that they see over the news.

   Judge SOUTER. You know what Charles Evans Hughes said:
"They read the papers."

   Senator DECONCINI. They read the papers, yes. After your com-
ment I asked my staff to give me the Gregg case, which I had not
read for some time. I remember opinion polls being cited some-
place. It was there and in a number of other cases.

   The CHAIRMAN. The question is, Senator, do they watch color tel-
evision, that's the real question.

  Judge SOUTER. I can tell you one nominee who doesn't unless he
is visiting somebody.

   Senator DECONCINI. That may be one of the biggest pluses you
have had, for your credit.

   Judge SOUTER. Well, I'm not about to get rid of that set right
now, if that's the case.

   Senator DECONCINI. Judge, let me go into the judicial activism
that was discussed last week. Senator Thurmond asked you last
Friday to describe what you thought the term judicial activism
meant? I did not have as much luck as my colleague did when I
asked you that question. You told him that you would consider it
judicial activism if a judge imposed his personal values rather than
searching for the values embodied in a constitution.

   Is that, in essence, correct?
  Judge SOUTER. That is fair to say.
   Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it is judicial activism to rule
that capital punishment is always cruel and unusual punishment?
  Judge SOUTER. I think that would be an insupportable decision
under the Constitution and I say that, sir, with a recognition that
there are members of the Supreme Court who disagree with me.
But that is an opinion which I could not join.

   Senator DECONCINI. Because, as you know, Brennan and Mar-
shall, at least in this lawyer's and Senator's opinion, certainly
reach for judicial activism in their efforts to state that that's how
they interpret the eighth amendment as it relates to capital pun-
ishment.

   You went into the Miranda and exclusionary rule at some length
with Senator Thurmond also. In your response you stated that Mi-
randa created a pragmatic rule, as you did just recently with Sena-
tor Grassley, you described the exclusionary rule in the same way.
Let me read back your response just to refresh your memory, be-
cause I am concerned about these decisions as to their activism and
what appear to me to be activism, although I can't disagree with
the decision in at least the Miranda case.

   "I think it's important to note"--this is you, Judge--"I think it's
important to note that when we look back on a decision which has
been on the books as long as Miranda has now, we are faced with
the similar, I think practical, obligation, if one wants to modify or
expand or contradict, to ask very practical questions about how it
actually works. That is a judicial obligation if the judiciary is going
to be imposing pragmatic rules."

   Your response leads me to this question. Should the Court be im-
posing rules such as Miranda and exclusionary and are they not
                                         249

really experimenting? And isn't that what you have indicated that
the Supreme Court was doing?

  Judge SOUTER. With the hindsight of history there is an experi-
mental cast to some of them. As you know, over the years, for ex-
ample, on the exclusionary rule there have been calls within the
Supreme Court to turn the Mapp decision around on the grounds
that it has simply not worked out, and that that is a fact which the
Court ought to face.

  I don't know of any theoretically satisfactory way of saying when
a pragmatic experiment sort of crosses that line it is something
that has to be condemned as activism. The courts have got an obli-
gation to, in effect, enforce standards. In the Miranda area what
the courts were concerned with was the amount of litigation which
was going into the question whether given confessions or admis-
sions had been obtained voluntarily or not, was simply placing
such a severe burden on the courts themselves, that there had to
be a better way to protect the ultimate interest which the 14th
amendment was trying to protect without, in fact, tying the courts
up in the kind of litigation which just seemed endless, fact-specific,
and detailed.

  The idea was if the police can get the Miranda warnings right,
they're going to obviate a large percentage of the voluntariness
cases. So that in the long run, law enforcement and judicial admin-
istration are going to be more efficient. Well, that was not a very
easy argument to sell to law enforcement when Miranda came
down, as you well know.

  But the fact is the intent of the Miranda decision was an intent
to provide better administration for the imposition of a standard
which we all, on each side of the issue, recognize had to be en-
forced.

  Senator DECONCINI. I think today I agree with that. I agree that
that is how they came to that conclusion. When that case came
down I was a prosecuting attorney and I certainly didn't agree to
it. I was outraged.

  In essence, isn't that really experimenting by the Supreme
Court? Wasn't the Court really trying to find a solution to its own
problems of being inundated on these types of questions?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, it was its own problems and it was law en-
forcement's problems, too. Yes, it was experimentation.

  I remember
  Senator DECONCINI. When
  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry.
  Senator DECONCINI. NO, go ahead.
  Judge SOUTER. NO, that is all right.
  Senator DECONCINI. In your own standard, Judge, and maybe
you can explain this, where do you draw the line? Does it have to
be a crisis matter of the Court, or is it just totally discretionary
when a majority of the Court thinks that experiments, "activism,
or whatever the majority decides the opinion is going to be, is that
where the line is, or where do you draw it?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, as I said a minute ago, I wish that I had a
neat formulation for it. At the very least, in searching for the line
we have got to keep in mind what I said in my discussion with Sen-
ator Thurmond. It is one thing to try to come up with a pragmatic
                                         250

approach to the enforcement of a constitutional value or standard
which is, itself, accepted. It is another thing to derive standards
based simply on personal judicial views of what would be desirable
in the world.

  I will grant you that when we get into the area of pragmatic ex-
perimentation, that can be a darn tough line to draw and I don't
know of any theoretically easy way to tell you how we would do it.

  Senator DECONCINI. Does it violate your interpretivist approach
to the Constitution, which you have expressed and explained quite
well, I think?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I don't think it should be seen as any pecu-
liarly interpretivist issue. Regardless of what your view may be of
the various schools of interpretivism, the fact is that the courts
have got an obligation to come down with practical decrees that
implement whatever rights and standards we do find in the Consti-
tution.

  When we are talking about decisions like Miranda, we are talk-
ing about the best way for a Court to exercise its--I guess you
might call its prudential power, to get to the right result, to en-
force the appropriate standard with the least amount of damage to
the body politic--because there is a price to be paid when confes-
sions are thrown out--and with the least damage to the judicial
system, which is constantly overwhelmed with litigation. I guess I
tend to look upon that as an issue more about the appropriate
scope of the Court's power to fashion remedies than an issue of in-
terpretivism about constitutional meaning as such.

  There is, of course--and this was true of the 1960's and 1970's
and it is always in the background of our thinking today that when
that kind of pragmatic experimentation does go on, it has an effect
on the Federal balance in the country, too. I think it is safe to say
that that is a value which the Court has also got to bear in mind
and that is not merely prudential.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, Judge, would you agree that the Mi-
randa decision is not likely to come back before the Court? It
seems to me pretty clear where we are on that. I want to ask you
whether or not you think that decision was correct?

  Judge SOUTER. Let me, if I may--let me approach it this way. I
do not rule out the possibility of that coming back before the Court,
but I think what I can probably say to it is that--and I have said
similar things from the bench in New Hampshire--that if that
issue does come back or one similar to it, I think there is an obliga-
tion on those who want to raise it to address the pragmatic issues.
How is it working today? How do we assess, if you say the price is
high, how do we assess that price? What do we really know about
what is going on?

  I think we are engaged in significant measure if such an issue
comes up in a very pragmatic weighing, and it must be addressed
that way.

  Senator DECONCINI. Then I take it from that if you conclude, as
a judge, that a decision is, indeed, pragmatic, experimental or judi-
cial activism, whatever term or adjective we might use, that be-
cause of that nature it probably ought to be reviewed or revisited.
Is that putting words in your mouth?
                                 251

Judge SOUTER. Well, I think that is a way of expressing, Senator,
a conclusion that you have to approach on what I call the thresh-
old question of the matter of precedent, and that is, was the deci-
sion wrong or not?
Senator DECONCINI. Judge, what about the Court ordering an
Jeleenckteinds1o?ffiCcioaluldto  raise property taxes  as   they did  in Missouri  v.
                                 this ever be within   the  remedial   powers of   the
judge or is it just clearly judicial activism?
Judge SOUTER. Well, as you know, Senator, that is an issue that
no matter how things turn out the Court is going to be revisiting.
The scope of the decision of last term is subject, as you know, to
great debate, and I think I have got to be very careful about what I
would say on that.
Senator DECONCINI. Let me phrase it in a different way, if I can.
If the Court rules or continues to rule that it is within its jurisdic-
tion and its interpretation, that elected officials must take some
action as to their proprietary interest regarding financing any-
thing. I am trying my best to stay away from that particular case.
My point is, in your opinion, does that disturb you that the Court
would move into an area of legislative, clearly legislative preroga-
tive and certainly one of long-standing precedence that the Court,
itself, has recognized and failing in the past to rule certain things
should happen because it is up to the "appropriators" or the legis-
lative body to fund them if they want to have them.
Can you give me a feeling of how you would address that theoret-
ical area?
Judge SOUTER. I think I would start by addressing it, by asking
whether, in fact, that question really has to be raised? I do not say
that lightly.
One of the peculiarities of last term's case was the fact that the
case came to the Court in almost a friendly posture. A decree was
being worked out in that case on a cooperative basis and, in fact,
the school administrators were apparently very well satisfied to in-
clude a great many extremely expensive items in the decree which
the Court was being asked to enforce, as you know, as a remedy to
a school segregation issue.
The case seemed to come to the Court in the posture that we
can't afford all of the other things that we have got to spend
money on and fund all of the very expansive details of this consent
decree consistently with the tax rate that we can impose, subject to
certain State restrictions on the raising of school taxes.
The case was presented to the Court in that posture. It seems to
me one of the issues that ought to be faced before the question of
the Court's remedial power is finally decided is whether that is the
posture in which such a case should come before the Court?
For example, shouldn't the issue be phrased in these terms, that
once a decree is ordered by the Court, the question is not whether
necessarily taxes have got to be raised and, if so, under what au-
thority they may be raised to do it, but whether, in fact, the politi-
cal branches of the Government responsible have made a decision
that they are going to put the implementation of this court decree
first. They are going to give that its highest priority in funding.
Because if that is the appropriate way to go about it, if there is,
as it were, a primacy of obligation to obey a court order, then the
                                                252

real question that is going to face the local taxing authorities is not
whether they have to raise taxes to fund the court order on top of
everything else, but whether they are going to continue to fund ev-
erything else in addition to the court order?

  It seemed to me that one of the difficulties of trying to focus the
issue in last term's case is that the political priorities at the local
level simply don't seem to have been addressed. If they are ad-
dressed, there is a real question in my mind as to whether or when
the Federal courts are going to get to the point of having to rule on
the question that so many people take that case of last term as
really standing for, and that is the right to impose or order the im-
position of a property tax.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, of course, that is the point. How can
the Court justify stepping into that area? They can certainly hold
constitutional rights as being denied, but to go so far as to say you
must shift your appropriations--and I think that's what you are
suggesting might happen if the Court isn't careful in reviewing the
cases before they consider them--shift your appropriation, local
school board, or State legislature, or the Congress of the United
States from building a B-2 bomber, which is not perhaps as consti-
tutionally protected, assuming you can argue that the defense is
adequate and putting it into prisons, because you are not treating
and granting prisoners a constitutional right that they have to
safety and other equal protections that they have.

  It just is very disturbing to me to see the Court moving in this
direction, and I have great respect for you, Judge, and the way that
you have answered these questions. It doesn't give me a lot of en-
couragement, other than you are going to think about it. And you
have thought about it. It seems to me that what you are saying is,
yes, we have got to consider it. The best I can tell you, Senator, is
in my objective observation now is that we ought to consider it at
the early stage before we accept a case for argument, and maybe
we can decide there that we shouldn't take it. But, yes, it is some-
thing that we have got to get into. Is that understanding

  Judge SOUTER. Ultimately we will.
  I say we, we on the judiciary will, where I will be on the judici-
ary, I will not say.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, thank you. I just want to say to you,
Judge Souter, that I am very impressed with your presentation
over the last 4 days and also the openness that you have come for-
ward with, different than other nominees that we have had, I must
say. Though I think you have adequately and properly protected
your need to withhold answers in some areas, because of decisions
before the Court I believe you will be confirmed to sit on, you took
advice from a number of us, I guess a number of us, that I hoped
you were forthcoming. Indeed, you have been in this Senator's
judgment, and you have expressed time and time again your great
intellectual capacity of the law that is, indeed, very impressive to
this Senator, one I am envious of, quite frankly, of your knowledge
of the cases that you have read over a long period of time or you
crammed in over the last month, however you did it, it is quite re-
markable. [Laughter.]
                                         253

  Whatever tutoring Senator Rudman gave you, I guess he de-
serves some credit, too, but quite frankly, Judge, I think you have
conducted yourself

  Judge SOUTER. I think you are going to have a fight on the com-
mittee here, Senator. [Laughter.]

  Senator DECONCINI. I think you have conducted yourself excep-
tionally well. It is not that I agree with everything you have said,
but you have certainly, in my opinion, not dodged some very tough
questions, and that is appreciated by this Senator very much.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you very much, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator THURMOND. Would the Senator from Arizona yield?
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Senator THURMOND. I just want to make this observation: In the
Missouri case you referred to, the Court held that a judge does not
have the power to impose taxes, but he could order officials to do
that. That is a very disturbing decision. We have introduced a bill
to reverse that decision. That is a legislative function. Whether
taxes are put on or how much taxes or how much or for what pur-
pose is not a judicial function, and we hope to reverse that decision,
and so I just thought I would mention that to you.

  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate that, sir. [Laughter.]
  Senator DECONCINI. I could not quite say it that tactfully, Mr.
Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is amazing, Judge, how the degree to which
people think you respond depends upon whether you answer ques-
tions, how you view capital punishment and not other things that
are before the Court.
  Also, Senator DeConcini had great credibility in his comments
until he suggested that possibly you were tutored on the law by
Senator Rudman. That is when we all began to have our doubts.
[Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. I think I can claim privilege on that, Mr. Chair-
man. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. What I would like to suggest is let us recess for 3
minutes, come back with Senator Specter's questioning, and during
that 3-minute recess, maybe you and I can confer as to how long
you would like to go before lunch.
  We will recess now for 3 minutes, to give you a chance to stretch
your legs.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  [Short recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Let me briefly describe the very brief discussion we had. What
we will do is continue with two more rounds of questioning from
the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont,
who will each question for a half hour. That will bring us roughly
around 1 o'clock. We will then break until roughly 2 o'clock. Actu-
ally, it is probably going to be quarter after 1 and quarter after 2,
and then what we will do is we will come back, starting with Sena-
tor Humphrey, our first questioner this afternoon of our witness,
and we will proceed on until we finish the second round, at which
time we will probably take a brief recess and then Senators who
still have questions, and I know that there are a handful who still
                                      254

have additional questions, will continue to pursue those questions
and we will make the judgment as we go, from that point on.

  Now let me yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator
Specter.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, I began with our point of departure last Friday on
your view of judicial interpretation. The starting point, from my
understanding of your judicial philosophy, comes in your extensive
opinion in the Estate of Dionne, where it is encapsulated, as fol-
lows, as I interpret it: "The Court's interpretive task is, therefore,
to determine the meaning of the article 14 language as it was un-
derstood when the Framers proposed it and the people ratified it as
part of the original constitutional text that took effect in June of
1784," so that you refer to understanding as the Framers proposed
it and the people ratified it at a specific time in 1784.
  Now, there has been a modification in what you have said, when
you move from meaning at that time to a broader interpretation of
meaning as that meaning might be understood at a later time. You
have given a very expansive interpretation of judicial authority,
when you talk about filling a vacuum, and as you go through the
points of analysis, a great deal of what you have had to say would
apply to a legislative judgment as well as to a judicial judgment.
  You talk about what liberty interest is involved for an individ-
ual, then you talk about what are the countervailing consider-
ations, it sounds very much like what a Senator might do, then you
add to that a test which we do not have, and that is the precedent
stare decisis, but you articulate that in terms which are very flexi-
ble, how long it has been in effect, what the principles are, what
reliance there has been, so that at every turn you come to some-
thing which is extremely flexible.
  The cases involving civil rights and taxing power and contempt
power in the Yonkers case are far-reaching applications, as I see it,
as to what the Court has done, which really moves into the position
of being a super legislature. Let us start with the point where Sen-
ator DeConcini ended, and that is with the decision in which the
Supreme Court of the United States said that the court had the
power to direct the local authorities to impose a tax, and your re-
sponse there was, "Political priorities at the local level are simply
not being addressed."
  Now, the difficulty that I see, the threshold with your response is
that you say political priorities are not being addressed at the local
level, and that the court can order the local officials to address
those political priorities.
  It is hard to find an issue which is more contentious in the politi-
cal arena than the tax issue. In the 10 years that I have been here,
that is about all we have talked about, as we have wrestled with
the issue of the deficit. The summiteers on the budget conference,
meeting at Andrews Air Force Base, are devoting their time, virtu-
ally exclusively, to the tax question.
  The political process in 1984, I think was decided largely, if not
exclusively, on the tax question. That issue was paramount again
in 1988, and it is the most essential political function that there is
in our society, to figure out when to raise taxes and how to raise
                                                255

taxes is subordinate and the Court did leave that to the local gov-
ernment here.

  But I would start with this question on this subject, Judge
Souter, and I would again refer to your language in Dionne, to look
to the Constitution, to the meaning of the language as understood
by the Framers and the people who ratified it, and ask where is
the constitutional authority on the very basic level for the Court to
introduce into what is the most essential legislative function on
taxation.

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I think the approach to that question is a
two-fold one. The first is, I know certainly from my familiarity
with my own 1784 constitution in New Hampshire, and I can speak
with equal certainty of the national Constitution, that the taxing
power in the sense of the Framers understood that is a power sub-
ject to the separation of powers was legislative, it was not judicial.

  The difficulty in the question that faces us and that was facing
the Supreme Court and, I presume from what I have been told this
morning, will definitely face the Supreme Court again, is in draw-
ing a line, if indeed a line is to be drawn there, between the appro-
priate scope of the judicial power in enforcing its own decrees and
the point at which those decrees cannot be enforced without a tax
increase.

  When I spoke earlier of what seemed to me the failure or uncer-
tainty of the means by which political priorities had been ad-
dressed at the local level, what I was trying to get at was that we
never take on a constitutional issue if there is a means of adjudi-
cating on a nonconstitutional basis. And it seems to me that the
question of how far the court's remedial authority goes, when it
runs smack up against a lack of money in the local treasury,
should be posed in this way. I do not think it should be posed by
saying will this judicial remedy exhaust the treasury; it should be
posed by saying can this judicial remedy be enforced within the
money available to government, bearing in mind that government
may have to put the judicial remedy first and decide that there are
other priorities for which it would like to spend which it can no
longer spend for, without raising taxes.

  Senator SPECTER. What is the authority of the court to establish
the priority?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I do not think the court has the authority to
establish the priority as such, but I think that the constitutional
issue does not really arise, unless the priorities or it does not arise
in a way which requires adjudication, unless those priorities have
been addressed at the political level, the local level. In other
words

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, I do not think that advances us
very far, when you take up the relative responsibility of the court
versus the legislature on something as fundamental as taxes.

  Let us go to another example, on the Spillone case, where you
have a contempt citation which was reversed against councilmen of
the city of Yonkers. The Court said that it was reversed only be-
cause they first should have proceeded with sanctions against the
city alone, but then added "only if that approach fails to produce
compliance within a reasonable time, should they then move to the
issue of a contempt citation against the council."
                                      256

  Now, where does a legislative responsibility begin and end, if the
court can order the council what to do? My question to you, is
there any difference between a city council in Yonkers and the
U.S. Senate? Does the court have as much authority to order the
Senate on what it should do in discharging its legislative role, as
the court has to order the city council of Yonkers, NY?

  Judge SOUTER. I would suppose that the answer to that is clearly
no, because the Senate of the United States is not going to be the
party to the kind of litigation which the Yonkers litigation pro-
duced. In other words, the Senate of the United States, I presume,
is not going to be a defendant in a civil rights action.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me give you a case. The Court holds
that it is unconstitutional to have prisoners in quarters which are
unacceptable. That has been a judicial interpretation, and the Con-
gress of the United States, including the U.S. Senate, is the only
agent which can impose taxes to build the prisons. The case comes
to the Supreme Court of the United States, there is a constitutional
right not to have cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth
amendment. The Supreme Court of the United States says that
there are too many prisoners in the Federal prisons, and then
orders, as the Court ordered the Kansas City authorities, says to
the Senate raise taxes to grant the constitutional rights of petition-
ers under the eighth amendment. There is a case.

  Judge SOUTER. Of course, the
  Senator SPECTER. The Court can do that, and now what is the
Senate going to do? Is that any different than the city council of
Yonkers, NY?
  Judge SOUTER. Of course, the difference is that the city council of
Yonkers, NY, is bound by the supremacy clause of the Constitu-
tion, so that there is an entirely different structural relationship
between the two.
  The second difference, it seems to me, is that the suit, even if in
fact there were a Federal action, the suit would not be against the
Senate of the United States, it would be against a subordinate
branch, a subordinate contingent of the executive branch.
  The third difference would be that the Court in those circum-
stances, if the executive branch could not get the funding to do the
construction and so on, would have an alternative, not merely the
alternative of ordering relief as in the Yonkers housing case, but it
would have the alternative of nonappropriation or nonfinancial
relief under the habeas power over conditions of prisoners, so I do
not think the Senate of the United States could ever possibly be in
that position.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Souter, the Senate could be named
as a party-defendant. You say that it could not be, but it would
take too ingenious a plaintiff's lawyer to name the Senate as a
party. You say the Court could order habeas corpus relief, that is
true. That translates, habeas corpus relief means that there would
be an order for the Federal prisons to release perhaps thousands of
prisoners, but the Court might not choose to do that. The Court
might choose to exercise its own remedial jurisdiction to say build
the prisons, we do not want the responsibility for releasing so
many thousands of prisoners.
                                      257
  Then you say that Yonkers is bound by the supremacy clause.
That is a question I want to get into at a later point, in terms of
jurisdiction of Marbury v. Madison and the authority of the Con-
gress to take away jurisdiction, but it seems to me that the Con-
gress is bound by the supremacy clause, unless we are to say that
the Congress can legislate and say that the Court does not have the
jurisdiction to order the Congress what to do.
  But in our system, Marbury v. Madison has already been respect-
ed, so conceptually, it seems to me that we could come to a situa-
tion logically where, if the city of Yonkers can be ordered what to
do, the council people can, so can the Senate.
  Let me turn to another subject which is illustrative along the
same line, and that is the issue of a super legislature and the inter-
pretation of the Civil Rights Act, this last year in Ward's Cove,
overruling the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
in Griggs in 1971. That is a particularly troubling issue today be-
cause the Senate and the House have each passed bills which
would reverse Ward's Cove, and the President has made plain his
intention to veto that legislation. It is an extraordinarily conten-
tious issue and one that I think would really be very injurious to
the country, would really tear the country apart in a lot of ways if
the Congress passes a civil rights bill that the President feels con-
strained to veto and it does not stand.
  This issue has arisen because of the Supreme Court's decision in
Ward's Cove, which has shifted the definition of business necessity
and changed the burden of proof. Without getting into all the par-
ticulars of the case, I find it particularly troublesome because four
of the five members of the Court appeared before the Judiciary
Committee in the past decade and talked very strongly about judi-
cial restraint, nonactivism, and then came to the Court and saw a
decision of the Supreme Court in Griggs, which had stood from
1971 until 1989. And, of course, the considerations on a reversal are
very different--which we all recognize--between a constitutional
decision, interpreting the Constitution as opposed to a statutory de-
cision because it is easy for Congress to alter an erroneous inter-
pretation of a statute; whereas, a constitutional amendment is
much more difficult. So the Courts have articulated the principle--
and I think you may have alluded to it earlier--that there is a dif-
ferent standard on overruling a constitutional interpretation,
which the Court ought to have greater latitude in overruling a
prior decision interpreting the statute. I think it is a fair legal con-
clusion that given 18 years that the Griggs opinion had stood, a
presumption of congressional acceptance of that interpretation of
burden of proof and business necessity.
  In articulating this question, I want to do so in a way which will
not intrude on a case which is likely to come before the Court, so I
will ask it first in general terms. Do you think it is appropriate for
the Supreme Court to affect a longstanding Supreme Court deci-
sion which has stood interpreting a congressional enactment?
  Judge SOUTER. I accept as a general rule, just as you said, Sena-
tor, that statutory interpretations are entitled to the highest claim
to be followed for the very reason that as statutory interpretations,
if there is anything wrong with them, legislatures--in this case,
the Congress--can take action to change them.
                                      258

  One of the kinds of facts that I don't know about the controversy
over Griggs and Ward's Cove goes to an issue of precedent that I
got into to some degree last week. We sometimes raise it under the
term of "acquiescence." I was speaking of it, to a large extent,
under the rubric of reliance. That is the extent to which in the
period between Griggs and Ward's Cove the Congress had specifical-
ly in one fashion or another addressed this problem and had ex-
pressly chosen to leave the law as it understood it to be following
the Griggs case.

  What we can say is that to the extent that the record shows that
the Congress has not merely sat passively, as it were, in the after-
math of Griggs but has specifically addressed the question and has
made choices to leave the law as it is, a record of that fact would,
of course, present an even stronger argument for leaving the inter-
pretation as it stood. And I don't know whether there are facts that
could be adduced in this case or not.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Souter, that might present a
stronger argument, but you need a stronger argument to leave
standing congressional acquiescence, even if the Congress has sat
passively.

  Judge SOUTER. YOU have a very strong argument for leaving the
precedent as it is. I think the point that--and this has come up
from time to time in cases when I was on the New Hampshire Su-
preme Court. I do not accept the position that never under any cir-
cumstances can a statutory interpretation be reexamined. I think
"never" is a pretty strong word. But there is a very, very strong
claim of precedent to be followed in those circumstances.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, why is "never" a strong word? If the Con-
gress has let it sit and the Congress has the authority to change it,
it seems to me "never" is the right word.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, except that I am not sure, as reviewing
courts, we always have the luxury to consider that interpretation
simply in a vacuum by itself. What I am trying to leave the door
open for are situations in which, in fact, in the time, let's say, after
the first decision the Congress itself has taken legislative action,
which if not directly contradictory, is at least arguably inconsistent
with the principle.

  If we get to a point on the issue of statutory interpretation where
the earlier statutory interpretation has become a kind of isolated
fluke, and we know that the Congress has, in fact, contributed to
this process by its own subsequent legislation, then I think we
ought to leave the door open for the fact that some coherence in
the law would justify a reexamination of it.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, that is an interesting hypothetical that
doesn't apply here, and I know you didn't suggest that it did.

  Judge SOUTER. I don't know one way or the other. That is right.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will testify for just a moment. It doesn't
apply here.
  Judge SOUTER. OK.
  Senator SPECTER. But even if it did and the legislative body has
legislated around it, they can legislate on that, too.
  But let me pick up on this business of vacuum. When you say if
the Congress has sat passively, that is less persuasive than if the
Congress has considered it and rejected it. But I would differ with
                                      259
you very sharply on that, Judge Souter, because when the Congress
sits passively, the Congress is deciding not to act. When you talk
about a vacuum, which you talked about on Friday--and you have
narrowed the vacuum substantially today, and I hope to have time
to come back to that--it is not a matter of a congressional decision
which should be taken lightly. Perhaps our strongest ability is to
do nothing. But frequently

  Judge SOUTER. I won't touch that one, Senator. [Laughter.]
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you. But frequently we do nothing with
deliberation. But I think it is highly dangerous for the Court to say
that you start to move into a vacuum because the Congress has
done nothing. We do nothing because we don't want anything done.
And there is a real concern if you take your interpretation--I hope
to come to interpretivism. There are a lot of subjects to be covered.
  When you talk about due process being more extensive than in-
corporation of the Bill of Rights, and then you talk about the liber-
ty interest being expansive, and then you say today that even de-
fining liberty as it was defined by Cardozo in Palco in terms of the
ordered concept of liberty, the interpretivists think that the defini-
tion of central to the concept of ordered liberty is an anathema, as
I read interpretivism. And you were saying that even if you have
the concept of ordered liberty, that is only a beginning point, be-
cause Palco and the concept of ordered liberty goes beyond.
  The concern that I raise here, Judge Souter, goes to a lot of very
important constitutional and governmental issues. And when you
have the Court functioning as a superlegislature, as I think the
Court did in Ward's Cove, and when you have the Court function-
ing as a superlegislature in the Garcia line, which just takes too
long to get into now, but you have Chief Justice Rehnquist and Jus-
tice O'Connor explicitly saying in Garcia we are just waiting for
another judge to come on our side, because the decision in Garcia
v. San Antonio Transit Authority won't stand, then you come to
the matter that when a judge is up for confirmation, we may not
respect the judge's right not to answer the ultimate questions if he
is really joining a superlegislature and should have to give an-
swers, just like Senators do when we run for office.
  I started with the proposition, as you know, that you ought not
to answer ultimate questions; you ought not to say how you are
going to decide the next case that comes before you, because the
tradition of the Court is briefs, argument, deliberation, case in con-
troversy, specific facts, and then you decide the case. But if the
Court is going to move into political priorities in taxes, and if the
Court is going to move into contempt citations against councilmen
and Senators, and if the Court is going to take an 18-year-old prece-
dent in a civil rights case and reverse it, then in that context, as a
superlegislature, Judge Souter, I would ask you the question: Why
shouldn't the nominee be compelled to answer the ultimate ques-
tion as to how he is going to decide the next case?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the answer to that, Senator, is that to the
extent to which the Court is perceived, reasonably perceived as
acting as a superlegislature, to exactly the same extent the rules
against getting into ultimate questions are going to weaken.
  You know, as you well know, the judgment about what is an ap-
propriate question to ask, the judgment about what is an appropri-
                                                260

ate answer to that question, has ultimately got to be your judg-
ment. The American people have their views. I have mine. But the
responsibility for making that judgment rests on this committee.
And I understand what you are saying.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, we have come a long way. There are
those who are saying now that we ought to compel or ought to do
our best--we can't compel, obviously, anything. That is your call--
but that we ought to push that issue and compel that answer be-
cause--they don't really articulate it in terms of the superlegisla-
ture, and they don't take it down these lines. They really want a
judge predisposed in their favor. And I don't think anybody is enti-
tled to that, no litigant is and no group which articulates any inter-
est.

  Judge Souter, that brings us to another really important issue,
and that is the relative authority of the President versus the
Senate to select Supreme Court Justices. I was surprised to find
years ago that in an original draft of the Constitution, the Senate
was given the authority to pick Supreme Court Justices. That sur-
prised me. Then you have a question as to is the Senate subordi-
nate or equal to the President, and I made the comment in my
opening statement that I think the Senate owes great deference to
the President's selection. But that always hasn't been the case.

  In the famous case involving John Rutledge, he voted against the
Jay treaty, so on purely critical grounds, the Senate rejected him
by a vote of 14 to 10.

  Now, there has been articulated a fascinating proposition that
the American electorate is intuitively imposing limits of power in
the United States by electing a Republican President and by elect-
ing a Democratic Congress, so that they want that kind of limita-
tion. There have also been those who have said that the President
may be seeking through the Supreme Court to put into effect an
agenda which the President can't achieve without having the
Court.

  I do not believe that President Bush has sought that. I think that
in his appointment of you the evidence is conclusive--I was about
to say virtually conclusive. Never say never. It is conclusive, I
think, that he is not seeking to find some way to carry on an
agenda. To make an appointment within 72 hours shows a lot of
courage. He had some good fact witnesses to attest to your good
character because the FBI investigations are not infallible.

  But that brings us to the question, if the Court is to be a super-
legislature and to carry out an agenda which is different from the
congressional agenda--and we face that in the civil rights area,
and we can't get it passed, the Presidential veto--then the issue
arises as to whether the Senate may come to the point of trying to
exercise its authority. Congress may try to exercise its authority
through the Senate to have an equal voice in the selection of Su-
preme Court nominees, to decide it very much as it was decided in
John Rutledge. If we don't like where you stand on the issues, then
we are going to come to a different conclusion and try to assert the
balance that the electorate has tried to impose with a President
from one party and a Congress from the other.

  My time is up. I just got a note. But your time isn't up. I would
be interested in your thoughts on that.
                                      261
  Judge SOUTER. My response to that, Senator, is that that does not
raise, it seems to me--you raise a very serious issue, but you do not
raise a justiciable issue. You are raising an issue of the self-defini-
tion of the Senate in relation to the President, and it is a matter
which should not and cannot come before the Courts.
  Senator SPECTER. NO, I know I am not raising a justiciable issue,
Judge Souter. I am raising questions about how far we can go in
asking you questions and a discussion as to the process and where
we are going to end up. Those are really very, very important ques-
tions. A lot of people have already decided that your nomination
process is over. Not everybody, but a lot of people have.
  Judge SOUTER. I don't necessarily have that feeling as I sit here
in the well of this room, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that is a further testimonial to
the high quality of your responses.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I noted you smiling when the Senator
from Pennsylvania said sometimes the Congress deliberately does
nothing. I suspect you understand that better than others because
sometimes people deliberately say nothing in answer to the ques-
tions. [Laughter.]
  Judge SOUTER. Sometimes they have to work at it, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. And you have worked at it very, very well, I
must say, with great aplomb. And I thought you defined very well
the responsibility of the Senate and your responsibility relative to
answering questions. That is why some of us still have not made up
our minds about how we are going to vote, myself included.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, will you just give me half a
minute?
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Senator THURMOND. The distinguished Senator referred to John
Rutledge not being confirmed. Well, over the years the Senate has
made some mistakes, and that is one mistake they made. He was
from South Carolina. [Laughter.]
  Incidentally, his brother Edward signed the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. They were both very prominent people. In their homes,
standing today in Charleston, if any of you ever go to Charleston,
SC, get on Broad Street, and the home of Edward Rutledge is on
one side, and right across is the home of John Rutledge. One signed
the Declaration, one signed the Constitution.
  I just thought I would call that to your attention. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I will now yield to the Senator from Vermont on
the condition that we don't hear anything about Vermont. I am
only kidding, Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. I was waiting for the part where Senator Thur-
mond was going to give us a list of good hotels to stay in. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Senator THURMOND. If you promise to go down there and learn
about South Carolina we will give you a free hotel accommodation.
[Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. Are you going to go there with me, Strom?
  Senator THURMOND. I won't promise you that. We will be glad to
have you though. The yankees come down and make the best
southerners you ever saw.
                                                262

  Senator LEAHY. I will leave that one.
  Where I come from, we think of Massachusetts as a Southern
State.
  Judge, I know that the chairman has already wished you a
happy birthday and I would join in that.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. I don t know what I will be doing on my 51st
birthday but I suspect that it won't be as memorable for me as
yours will be for you. You will probably have a much easier time
remembering yours.
  Judge SOUTER. I won't forget this one.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, let's go back, if we could, to the Seabrook
issue. As attorney general--and, as I recall, you were attorney gen-
eral at the time I'm talking about--the Governor used public funds
to promote a private utility by putting pro-Seabrook petitions--in
fact, they were printed and distributed at State cost--in State
liquor stores.
  Was that an appropriate use of State money?
  Judge SOUTER. NO. I think it was not.
  Senator LEAHY. Were you asked to advise him on that at the
time?
  Judge SOUTER. NO, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. According to press accounts, those who were op-
posed to the Seabrook plant were not given a chance to place their
petitions in State liquor stores, is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. I think that--I'm sure that is, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Would that be appropriate? They were denied a
chance to do that while public funds were being used to promote
this same private business?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think by the use of the public funds or the
use of the stores, in effect, as a forum, in effect, implicates a first
amendment right.
  Senator LEAHY. SO that if the State was using State funds to pro-
mote that, those who wanted to use private funds to oppose it
ought to have been allowed to do so, is that what you are saying?
  Judge SOUTER. The State, in effect, had designated that as a
forum, at least, for the collection of views, for expression; to that
extent, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion, in the
Vvitton trademark case. He noted, and let me quote him, "And no
one suggests that some doctrine of necessity authorizes the Execu-
tive to raise money for its operations without congressional appro-
priation."
  Now, going back again to the Seabrook case, where money was
raised for the prosecution. If a State is bringing charges is it not
the responsibility of the Executive--whether the prosecution or the
Governor--to go to the legislature and say, "here is what it's going
to cost; give us the funds" rather than "passing the hat," as you
described it on Friday?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the appropriate place to go is to the legis-
lature and as I think you kndw, that is where I went.
  Senator LEAHY. Yet, the principal owner of Seabrook--the Public
Service Company--raised a considerable amount toward the cost of
that prosecution, is that correct?
                                               263

  Judge SOUTER. They did in the instance of the 70-some-odd-thou-
sand-dollar payment. Something was said earlier this morning
about the possibility of a second one. I'm not aware that they made
a second one, but I think $70,000 is a lot of money.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, most of the protesters were part of the so-
called Clam Shell Alliance, is that correct?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes. What I don't know offhand and certainly
have forgotten is the proportion of protesters who were members of
the Clam Shell Alliance and those who belonged to other affiliated
organizations. But the Clam Shell Alliance was certainly the cen-
tral organization, as I recall.

  Senator LEAHY. And during the time when they were carrying
out protests against Seabrook, was the State of New Hampshire
carrying out an undercover operation, infiltrating the Clam Shell
Alliance?

  Judge SOUTER. I was not aware that they were. That was the sub-
ject, I was reminded last week, that was the subject of a question to
me in a deposition. To the best of my knowledge, no one in the at-
torney general's office was aware of any activity of that sort. I am
not aware now what there was but nobody in the AG's office, I
think, was aware of any activity of that sort until a year or more
later.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, the executive director of the New Hamp-
shire State Police said in a deposition in 1984: "The State had been
carrying on undercover surveillance of the Clam Shell Alliance
since 1976."

  Was there no reporting to you as the chief law enforcement offi-
cer of the State about that?

  Judge SOUTER. NO; there was not. My understanding
  Senator LEAHY. Did you, would you normally check on what the
State police were doing in a major area in their intelligence gather-
ing?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, it didn't occur to me to ask, I guess, any
more than it would occur to me to ask in serious criminal cases
whether they were using informants.
  My understanding is that what the State police officer was refer-
ring to was the use of members within the organization who would
report to the State police. There was no wiretapping going on;
there was no surveillance by police officers, as such. There was, ap-
parently I gather from the response in the other deposition that
you alluded to, that there was someone or some persons who were
reporting to the State police on what the plans were.
  So that there was nothing that required the State police to get
my permission, as for example, there would have been if there had
been a wiretap involved or electronic eavesdropping.
  Senator LEAHY. According to the deposition, there was undercov-
er surveillance going on, I am told. But you were not aware of such
surveillance?
  Judge SOUTER. No. In fact, as I said a moment ago, the only
thing that even to this day I thought they were referring to, in the
period in question in the Seabrook demonstrations, was the passing
on of information from somebody within the organization. But, in
any event, I do not know of it.
                                      264
  Senator LEAHY. Senator Metzenbaum raised a question this
morning about a deposition of James Cruz, the assistant attorney
general working on the Seabrook case with Mr. Rath. He said that
at a meeting with the Governor on April 26--this was 3 days
before the protest began--one possibility that was discussed was
that the Public Service Company would be paying some of the bill
for the law enforcement effort at the site.
  So the idea of getting money from the PSC was discussed by your
office prior to the actual demonstration, was it not?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I don't know whether--I am taking that
deposition just on its face; that's all I know and I guess just to be
careful about what's in the deposition--I don't know whether any-
body from my office discussed it, but if it was mentioned at that
meeting, then he heard about it.
  Senator LEAHY. My concern and the reason I have raised these
issues--and you and I have discussed them privately also--is that,
as a former prosecutor, I get very concerned if prosecutors do any-
thing that appears that they are in a position of not being impar-
tial when they bring charges, or when they decide they will drop
charges, or carry the charges on, or decide what they might seek
for sentences.
  You were very active in the prosecution. You went to the court
after the first person was given a suspended sentence and raised
objections to that, saying that you wanted prison terms and were
opposed to suspended sentences, and you have given your reasons
for that.
  My concern is, if a private company was paying for part of the
prosecution, part of carrying it on, does that private company
become your client rather than the people of New Hampshire?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, that private company did not become my
client. The difficulty that has to be faced is there is a question
raised. Hence, as I was saying in the discussion with Senator Metz-
enbaum, the appearance of justice is an independent value in its
own right.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU discussed the Dionne case here and you said
that the clause in the New Hampshire Constitution about, in effect,
private individuals paying into the court fund was designed to pre-
vent bribery.
  But here, there is an ad hoc fund; it was established by the Gov-
ernor, not by the legislature; it doesn't have the kind of public
scrutiny that goes into the development of a statute; it is not limit-
ed to contribution from the State on whose behalf you brought the
prosecution.
  If the fund in Dionne was to prevent bribery, does this fund not
look as though it goes in just the opposite direction?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I hope it doesn't give the appearance of
bribery. The appearance that I am concerned with is the appear-
ance of influence. The fund, as I understand it, both what the
Public Service Co. contributed and what other people around the
country contributed in small contributions went into the general
fund of the State so that there was no, I think, there was no ques-
tion of anybody being bribed with the money.
  But the question that is properly raised with respect to the
Public Service contribution is does it give the impression that they
                                                265

were thereby in a position to exercise undue influence over what
should be independent law enforcement decisions?

  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever express that concern to the Gover-
nor?

  Judge SOUTER. I do not recall ever discussing the subject with the
Governor. As I said, the only recollection that I had which I men-
tioned last week was the--well, it wasn't, in fact, even a recollec-
tion--the only record that I found last week was on June 30 there
was a reference in the minutes of the Governor and counsel that
the acceptance of the funds had been proposed. I didn't otherwise
recall the incident.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, on another subject, you talked with Sena-
tor Simon and expressed empathy, which I think we all agree with,
for a Jewish friend who grew up in Manchester, NH, and who was,
to quote you, "cut apart from the rest of the class each morning
when the Lord's Prayer was recited."

  But when you were attorney general you publicly defended a law
passed by the New Hampshire Legislature which permitted school
districts to authorize the recitation of that same prayer in school.

  I understand and I accept the sensitivity that you expressed to
Senator Simon, but in light of that, how could you publicly support
that law?

  Judge SOUTER. What I said was that if the law were called into
question, in a lawsuit, that I would defend the law. Quite frankly, I
think if we had reached the point, which we never did, I think
probably I would have had to state to the court, that following
Lemon, that the law couldn't be enforced.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me follow on that because the papers
had you saying that you would do everything you could to uphold
the law at the time.

  Judge SOUTER. That's correct.
  Senator LEAHY. SO is your attitude about it different today than
it was then?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think it's not a matter of attitude, it's a
matter of reflection and research. I think if, in fact, the law had
been called in question and it had become incumbent upon me to
file a brief with the court on the State's position, quite frankly, I
don't think we could have found a defensible basis for it. I think we
would have confessed constitutional error.
  I was ready to do everything I could to defend that or any State
statute. But I think if we had gotten to that point, I think we
would have to have admitted that there was a constitutional defi-
ciency.
  Senator LEAHY. And if the quote in the paper is accurate, "in
that case our concern is to do everything we can to uphold the
law," that quote would be inconsistent with what you are saying
here?
  Judge SOUTER. I have no reason to say that the quote isn't accu-
rate and I assume it is accurate, but the standard for any action by
an attorney general and my standard was that I would uphold, I
would act as an advocate to uphold State action if I could do so in
good faith and without taking a frivolous position before the courts.
  I think when we had finally gotten through analysis and reflec-
tion I don't think we could have found a basis to uphold it and I
                                              266

think I would have been forced in that situation to say, no, we
have got a constitutional defect here.

  Senator LEAHY. In the Abington case where the judge said the
law was patently and obviously unconstitutional, you do not have
any problem with that?

  Judge SOUTER. No.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU said, Judge, that you would listen respectful-
ly to the school of thought that says the establishment clause was
originally intended to have a very narrow scope, only to prevent
the literal establishment of a State religion or to prevent Govern-
ment from favoring one Christian sect over another. The same
school of thought says that we should not require Government neu-
trality on religious matters, that Government action should be per-
mitted as long as it does not tend to create a State religion or
coerce people.

  Now, let us assume for a moment that this original intent school
of thought is historically correct--that, as many argue very strong-
ly, the Framers did have a very narrow view of the establishment
clause--would this lead you to modify the principle of neutrality
that has been accepted by the Supreme Court for decades?

  Judge SOUTER. It would lead me to raise the question but it
would not give me the answer. There are basically two other con-
siderations. The first in this, as in any such case, is the claim of
precedent. The second consideration which may fall, to a degree,
under the claim of precedent, which is, at least, I think worth stat-
ing, stating separately, is whether, in fact, assuming that was the
view of the Framers, the best way to affect it today is the way that
the Court has, in fact, already taken.

  So that I do not regard the issue in this or in any other case as
simply being a simple issue of what exactly was the original under-
standing because we are not being asked to adjudicate on a clean
slate.

  Senator LEAHY. But we are talking about a constitutional doc-
trine that has been accepted for what, 40 years now?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you see the necessity of changing that consti-
tutional doctrine?
  Judge SOUTER. AS I think I said, in any case, say now, I do not
approach the Court with any inclination or agenda to do so. I will
listen to that argument if it is made before me and I will listen re-
spectfully as I would to any argument that is made before me.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand that, Judge. Maybe we are just
going past each other on this issue, but I'm not talking about some-
thing that seems to be in a rapid state of flux. We are not talking
about the tax issues that have been very appropriately raised by
other Senators based on cases that have occurred just in the last
few months or a year.
  Judge SOUTER. NO, I appreciate that.
  Senator LEAHY. We are talking about something 40 years old.
Are you saying that you do not have a view, irrespective of what
that view is, are you saying that you do not have a view in your
own mind whether that 40-year-old doctrine is correct or not?
  Judge SOUTER. I think it would be better for me to say that I do
not have the view, if I were to go on the Court, that that doctrine
                                               267

should be changed. I am not approaching it with an inclination to
upset the law in that respect.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me ask this question, without saying
what it is, do you have a view, in your mind, today, as to the cor-
rectness of that doctrine or not?

  Judge SOUTER. Not a personal view. I have read the opinion in
which that view was expressed. I have not done research on it
myself, and I do not necessarily adopt it or reject it. I realize that it
is there, and it has been put forward by some members of the
Court.

  Senator LEAHY. Suppose the original meaning of the clause was
only to prevent a State religion or Government preference among
Christian sects, would you then think it was appropriate for Gov-
ernment to favor Christianity over Judaism or any other religion?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think any such conclusion as that would
make the claim of precedent an extremely crucial one. I mean, I
think you are saying is, well, let's assume that we found that the
establishment clause had a very narrow intended meaning. Do we
ignore, essentially, the development of the law for the last 40

  Senator LEAHY [continuing]. That's right.
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. Or the last 200 years? The answer is,
no, we don't deal with constitutional problems that way.
  Senator LEAHY. But you are taking account of people's changes
in attitudes over those 200 years.
  Judge SOUTER. And as particularly embodied in the precedent
which exists.
  Senator LEAHY. Would you similarly take such changes into ac-
count in interpreting other aspects of the establishment clause or
other constitutional provisions? I am thinking of due process, equal
protection, liberty, things like that.
  Judge SOUTER. Certainly.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge Souter, on Friday you said that whether
you considered abortion either moral or immoral would play abso-
lutely no role in any decision you make on the issue. You said fur-
ther that with respect to the death penalty there are cases in
which--and let me just read it to make sure I have it right--"in
which judges' moral views are so strong that they simply cannot
preside, and we have to recognize the moral compunctions that a
judge would feel in those circumstances, and we have to recognize
a right to recuse if a judge feels that way."
  You also said in an answer, I believe it was to Senator DeCon-
cini, that you do not support the concept that the death penalty by
itself is cruel and unusual punishment.
  Judge SOUTER. Given its recognition in the Constitution, I don't
think we can start with that, no.
  Senator LEAHY. And obviously it leaves you open on an individ-
ual case, but as a blank statement of law you don't agree with that.
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have expressed concern about doctors being
compelled to advise patients on the abortion issue and judges being
forced to decide whether minors should have access to abortion.
You have told us that you can empathize with the woman who
faces that difficult question and decision.
                                      268

  Now, are your own views on abortion, whatever they might be,
so strong that you could not preside over a case dealing with either
abortion or parental consent?

  Judge SOUTER. No. I think I could deal with those issues.
  Senator LEAHY. In the
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, may I just make one word?
  Senator LEAHY. Sure.
  Judge SOUTER. I don't mean in answering your question in the
short way that I did to give any indication of the strength or weak-
ness one way or the other of my feelings. What I mean to say is my
feelings are such that I could still deal with those issues.
  Senator LEAHY. In the same way that a judge may have a person-
al feeling on capital punishment but could still preside over a cap-
ital case?
  Judge SOUTER. That is right. And I think what I was referring to
in the several cases that you have alluded to are situations in
which judges recognize that their feelings are such that they
simply cannot deal dispassionately with those issues or that they
cannot do so without breaking their own moral codes.
  Senator LEAHY. Just to go back a bit to earlier questions about
Seabrook and the establishment clause. We have talked about dif-
ferent things that came up when you were attorney general and
statutes that were passed by the legislature and signed into law by
the Governor and found unconstitutional.
  Did you ever have a time when you went to the Governor or the
legislature and said, look, you cannot do this, it is just downright
unconstitutional?
  Judge SOUTER. I don't ever recall being asked for legislative
advice on that. I may very well have done it in the course of testi-
mony, but I don't remember it. I do remember one specific instance
in which the Governor discussed proposed action with me and
asked for an opinion as to whether it was constitutional or not. I
gave him an opinion, and I cannot break into the attorney/client
privilege, but I can tell you that he took my advice on the subject.
  There were other instances--and these weren't during my tenure
as attorney general, so they may be outside the scope of your ques-
tion. You tell me if they are. But I can recall times during Mr.
Rudman's tenure as attorney general when we were asked to give
advice on that sort. The one that immediately comes to mind was
the limits on permissible State action under the doctrine of Bran-
denburg v. Ohio. Advice on that score was requested by Governor
Peterson, who was Governor I think in 1969, as he anticipated a
visit of what was called the "Chicago Three"--those were three of
the Chicago Seven--to speak at the University of New Hampshire,
which was not universally popular. I worked on the memorandum
which discussed the constitutional limits of State action in that
case, and that advice was taken.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, you have said that the marital right to
privacy is a fundamental right. And if I understand correctly the
answer you gave to Senator Metzenbaum earlier today, you feel
that Griswold is settled law. Is that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I have been careful not to endorse the spe-
cific holding of Griswold or its opinions, but I think I have been
very clear in saying that I believe that there is a marital right to
                                          269

privacy. And we have discussed some of the incidents at its core,
including the reproductive right to determine whether or not to
conceive a child as certainly being right at the center of it.

   Senator LEAHY. DO you believe the idea of marital privacy is set-
tled law?

   Judge SOUTER. Well, it is clear to me. I think the only point at
which I will quibble about the settled law is, as I think I said in
one case last week, I suppose that everyone assumes that if there
were a successful attack on Roe v. Wade, that would then call into
question prior privacy cases. So I suppose one simply cannot say
that it is settled in the sense that it is inconceivable that it could
be challenged.

   Senator LEAHY. YOU do not have the same sense, to whatever
degree you consider privacy in Griswold settled--to whatever
extent that is--you do not have in your own mind the same sense
of settlement on Roe v. Wade. Is that correct?

   Judge SOUTER. Well, with respect, sir, I think that is a question
that I should not answer because I think to get into that kind of a
comparison is to start down the road on an analysis of one of the
strands of thought upon which the Roe v. Wade decision either
would or would not stand. So, with respect, I will ask not to be
asked to answer that.

   Senator LEAHY. But you don't feel the same compunction against
answering the same question regarding Griswold?

   Judge SOUTER. Well, I have drawn a fine line on Griswold. I have
said that I believe there is, in fact, a marital right to privacy which
is at the core of any privacy doctrine. I have not endorsed the Gris-
wold decision as such. It is a fine line to draw, Senator.

   Senator LEAHY. That is my point.
   Judge SOUTER. Yes, it is.
   Senator LEAHY. Last week, you told us a very powerful story, a
very moving story, about the counseling you gave to a young
woman who faced the question of an unwanted pregnancy. Obvi-
ously, it is a very personal issue. You counseled that woman.
Many, many, many more face the same decision each year. You did
not tell us what your advice was, and I understand, from the two
or three times you have been asked that question in various forms,
you do not intend to tell us what that was.

   Might I ask you this: Would your advice to that woman be any
different today now that abortion has been legal for nearly 20
years?

   Judge SOUTER. With respect, I do not think I can answer that
question.

   Senator LEAHY. Let me then close with this, at least on this
round. You have spoken movingly here and in our private conver-
sations, and I have been very affected by what you have said. I was
very impressed by your response when you said--and I hope every
judge thinks about this--when you said that any decision a judge
makes is going to affect somebody, probably for the rest of his or
her life--no matter what your decision is. That is something every
judge should keep in mind. Those of us who are prosecutors know
that prosecutors should think about it; everybody should.
                                                270

  Applying that principle, what, in your view, would be the
effect--not the legal, but the practical consequences of overturning
Roe v. Wade--the practical consequences?

  Judge SOUTER. There would be the obvious practical immediate
political consequence that the issue would become a matter for leg-
islative judgment in every State. I think it is safe to say that those
legislative judgments would not be uniform. There would be, I
daresay, a considerable variety in the scope of protection afforded
or not afforded. The issue of federalism would be a complicated
issue.

  Senator LEAHY. When I was a prosecutor, at that time it was
prior to Roe v. Wade, or in Vermont, the case of Beecham v. Leahy,
et ah, cases that changed the laws. Abortion was against the law
prior to Roe. I prosecuted an abortion case. It was the only abortion
case I picked to prosecute.

  A call came to me in the middle of the night from the emergency
room of our hospital. A young woman who was hemorrhaging
nearly died. She did not. She did, however, end up sterile from a
botched abortion. Our investigation found that the man arranging
the abortions would bring young women from the Burlington area
in Vermont, across the border to Montreal. The abortions were
then performed by a woman who had learned the procedure while
working for the SS at Auschwitz. The man I prosecuted would then
blackmail these women after the abortion, either for money or for
sex. In this case, it came to our attention because the woman
nearly died and was brought into the emergency room; that opened
up the whole issue. We found out about it, I conducted an investi-
gation, prosecuted the man, and he went to prison.

  I am not asking--and you have stated that you are not going to
state how you would rule on Roe v. Wade. I mention this incident
only from a legislator's point of view based on my experience as a
former prosecutor about what the practical effect of outlawing
abortion might be.

  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate that. Thank you.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will recess until 2:15.
  [Whereupon, at 1:18 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:15 p.m., the same day.]

                                           AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I and my colleagues apologize for start-
ing--I guess we are 12 minutes later--not guess, I know, looking at
the clock.

  Next time there is a Supreme Court Justice, I would respectfully
request that that Justice decide not to announce his retirement
until he is certain everything is calm in the world and that we are
going to be in recess the whole time so nothing else can interfere
with these very important processes. But I apologize, Judge.

  Judge SOUTER. NO need to, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, we are to go next to our colleague from
Alabama, Senator Heflin, but I have been entreated by our col-
league from Utah, who says that he would just like a few minutes
to correct the record. My friend from Alabama indicated he did not
                                         271

mind. If the Senator from Utah really means a few minutes, there
is no problem at all--excuse me, the Senator from New Hampshire
is seeking recognition.

  Senator HUMPHREY. An inquiry. It was my understanding that I
was to be the first questioner following lunch.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry. Maybe you are. I beg your pardon.
You are absolutely correct. The way it was supposed to work is
that whenever Senator Simpson came back, we would have him. If
he were the next Republican in order to be recognized, it would be
him. Quite frankly, I didn't think he was coming back. That is why
I indicated you would be next. I will let you two fellows fight that
out while I recognize our colleague from Utah for just a few min-
utes. I will be bound by whatever the two of you conclude is the
better way to do it.

  I was wrong. It was not you, anyway, next, Senator. It is one of
our Republican colleagues. So I am sorry.

  Having said that, a few minutes to correct the record.
  Senator HATCH. I thank the chairman. I have to go manage a bill
on the floor, but I did want to correct the record a little bit.
  I would just like to make this point, Judge Souter. Not even Jus-
tice Brennan adopted the view that mere congressional silence
equals acquiescence in erroneous Supreme Court decisions or con-
struction of a statute. Some Justices have spoken in more deferen-
tial terms toward prior errors in statutory construction because it
is easier for Congress, they think, to revise a statute and repair the
Court's mistake than it would be to amend the Constitution. But
Justices Brandeis and Powell and Justices Potter Stewart and Wil-
liam Brennan, among others, acknowledge that erroneous interpre-
tations of Federal statutes are also subject to correction by the
Court. I would think that just goes without saying.
  Judge, would you comment on this remark by Justice Brennan in
the Boys Market case which overturned an 8-year-old interpreta-
tion of a labor statute in Sinclair Refining Company v. Atkinson?
He said this, Brennan said, "The Court has cautioned that it is at
best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption
of a controlling rule of law."
  I might add that in Boys Market Justice Brennan also quoted
Justice Frankfurter's opinion in the 1940 case of Havering v. Halec:
"Stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula
of adherence to the latest decision"--precisely what you have been
saying--"however recent and questionable, when such adherence
involves a collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its
scope, intrinsically sound, or unverified by experience."
  Now, that is all I want to say, but do you disagree with those
comments?
  Judge SOUTER. NO, I wish I could have said it that well. I think
one of the points that I was trying to make this morning is that in
deciding the degree of weight to be given to a longstanding statuto-
ry interpretation, we cannot make that decision without looking
not only to the time which has elapsed since that first decision, but
to what else both the legislature and the courts have been doing.
And the vitality of an earlier interpretation depends in part upon
its coherence with what has passed since that time. We simply
cannot divorce that possibility from our thinking.
                                                272

  Senator HATCH. Thank you. I just wanted to correct the record,
and I want to thank the chairman and my two Republican col-
leagues who have deferred to me in this matter. I will go to the
floor and get out of everybody's hair.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Apparently the Senator from New Hampshire
will be next. Senator Humphrey.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good afternoon, Judge. One of the things that fascinates me
about the law, Judge, is the consistency and the striving for con-
sistency. That is admirable. However, when we uncover inconsist-
ency, it can be very frustrating. I want to explore a couple of areas
that I regard as inconsistencies and see what thoughts they pro-
voke.
  Judge Souter, is an unborn child capable of inheriting or owning
an estate?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, in the civil law, for example, the rule on
future interest recognizes the possibility of inheritance by an
unborn child who is born alive and able to take.
  Senator HUMPHREY. But even during gestation, an unborn child
may have an interest in an estate, may be left an estate, a legacy--
is that not correct--even during gestation, and that interest can be
protected under the law?
  Judge SOUTER. With respect, that is an issue which is capable of
varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and I will be candid to say
to you that I don't recall a specific decision on it in the law of New
Hampshire, which is the jurisdiction I would be familiar with.
  Senator HUMPHREY. But I think it is known--as you say, it is
more than likely to be a substantial difference from State to State,
but it is a fact that an unborn child may be left a legacy and that
may be protected under the law. How do you reconcile the fact that
an unborn child has the capacity which may be protected by law to
inherit and own an estate or a legacy on the one hand, while under
Roe v. Wade on the other hand the very same unborn child has no
enforceable right to life?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I really cannot take up the task of recon-
ciling that. As I said a moment ago, I am not sufficiently familiar
with the specific body of civil law that you refer to, and the only
thing I can say, as you know, is that Roe v. Wade is discussing a
constitutional issue. One of the elements in the equation to which
it speaks is the right of the mother. And the kind of inconsistency
that you pose is, in fact, in the terms in which you pose it, an ap-
parent reflection of weighting different interests of differential po-
tential parties. But, beyond that, there really isn't anything I can
say about reconciling it.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, again, these are in some measure rhe-
torical questions. I am hoping to advance the public dialog on this
issue by means of these questions.
  You talk about weighing the interests. What interests of the
unborn child does Roe acknowledge?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I think with respect that it is nec-
essary for me to take the same position in response to your ques-
tion that I have in response to the questions from some of your col-
                                              273

leagues; that a dissection of Roe v. Wade is simply a step, and a
significant step, in the direction of an evaluation of that case
which, in view of its likelihood in some form or another on the
docket of the Supreme Court, if I were to be confirmed, is just a
subject that I cannot discuss without giving misleading suggestions.

   Senator HUMPHREY. We need to develop an abbreviated answer
so that each time this situation arises you can just say whatever it
is you choose to say in a few words, so we don't have to go through
the long explanation. I understand where you are coming from,
and I didn't expect an explicit answer on that. But, in fact, Roe v.
Wade assigns no weight at all and no rights at all to the fetus.

   Let me just read the core of Roe. The Court held that, "For the
stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the
abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical
judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician." First 3
months, no State interference.

   "For the stage subsequent to and approximately the end of the
first trimester, the State, in promoting the interests and the health
of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure
in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health." Second
trimester, no rights or interests assigned to the fetus.

   Third trimester: "For the stage subsequent to viability"--after,
viability now. We are talking--if that is an important dividing
point for some people. I don't think it is terribly important myself,
but for some it is. "For the stage subsequent to viability, the State,
in promoting its interests in the potentiality of human life"--what-
ever that is, a cute phrase--"may, if chooses"--"may, if it chooses,
regulate and even proscribe abortion, except where necessary in
appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or
health of the mother."

   So in Roe the Court found that the fetus has no rights and no
interests. It says the States may if they choose. May. But it leaves
that matter entirely up to the States and finds nothing, apparently,
under the 14th amendment or any other provision of the Constitu-
tion that needs to be brought to bear in the interest of the fetus. So
that when we talk about weighing the interests of the mother and
the fetus, there is no weighing in Roe. None. All of the rights and
weight are assigned to the mother and nothing, zero, to the child.
And here is why.

   The majority in Roe recognized the importance of the personhood
issue to the disposition of the Roe case. Quoting from the majority
opinion, "If this position of personhood is established, the case for a
right to abortion collapses, for the fetus' right to life is then guar-
anteed specifically by the amendment." Referring to the 14th, of
course.

   So the issue of personhood is all critical and all important in this
controversy. The Court found--wrongly, in my opinion--that the
fetus is not a person, even though the fetus may inherit and own
property, a legacy, that it is not a person, has no right to have its
life protected by the Constitution.

   Let's look at another inconsistency. Judge Souter, is a corpora-
tion a person?

  Judge SOUTER. Again, in the abstract, we really can't answer
that question. We have to know exactly what the context is. We
                                                274

know, for example, that in civil law corporations may be parties to
litigation. We know that corporations can be defendants under the
criminal law, and that probably is in your mind if you asked the
question.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes. Well, for over a hundred years, corpora-
tions have been considered formally persons in various Supreme
Court decisions, the first of which was Santa Clara County v.
Southern Pacific Railroad Company in 1886, which found that the
corporation is a person for purposes of the equal protection clause.
Then 3 years later, in Minnesota and St. Louis Railway Company
v. Beckwith, the Supreme Court found that corporations are per-
sons with respect to the due process clause.

  So we have the incredible and the ironic and the tragic situation
where corporations, which clearly are not human beings from the
biological point of view, are found to be persons under the 14th
amendment. But the offspring of human beings, which by any
standard of science and biology are clearly human beings, are
found by the Supreme Court in Roe not to be persons. Corporations
are persons and may be protected under the 14th amendment, but
human beings, even a day before birth, are not persons under the
14th amendment.

  Now, if there was ever an inconsistency and a revolting incon-
sistency and a cruel inconsistency, and one that begs for correction,
sir, that is it. You needn't respond to that.

  Let's talk about the 14th amendment. Its origins are important,
obviously, in the interpretation of the Constitution. Let me ask you
this question, Judge Souter. I don't know that it has been clearly
established yet. Do you consider yourself an interpretivist, or just
what school do you claim?

  Judge SOUTER. I regard myself as within the broad umbrella of
interpretivism, and I have tried in response to a couple of questions
to explain that the search that I am engaged on is a search for
principle as opposed to specific intent when I approach a constitu-
tional provision initially.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Would you repeat that last part again,
please?

  Judge SOUTER. I said when I am approaching a constitutional
provision, leaving aside entirely the question of precedent that may
have accreted around it, what I am searching for is the meaning,
which in most cases is a principle, intended to be established as op-
posed simply to the specific application that that particular provi-
sion was meant to have and that was in the minds of those who
proposed and framed and adopted that provision in the first place.

  Senator HUMPHREY. The principle that underlies the provision.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HUMPHREY. That is your first resort.
  The principal sponsor, the chief sponsor in the House of Repre-
sentatives of the resolution to amend the Constitution which, upon
ratification, became the 14th amendment, Congressman John
Bingham, said with respect to the scope of the 14th amendment
language that it was to include "any human being." Any human
being. He didn't say anything about persons. He said "any human
being."
                                               275

  And Senator Jacob Howard, the main Senate sponsor of the
amendment, said the language should be applied to "even the hum-
blest, poorest, and most despised of the human race."

  These are things that no doubt you are going to be reviewing one
day.

  Friday, you and I had an exchange on the 14th amendment and
whether it extends to every human being. And I asked what is the
difference between a living human being and a person, and you
said, "Without being more specific about the legal context, I don't
know that there would be any point in drawing that kind of dis-
tinction."

  Let me try to put it in a narrower context, then. With regard to
the 14th amendment's protection of life, what is the difference be-
tween a living human being and a person?

  Judge SOUTER. I think the only thing that can be said, Senator, is
we know that one distinction is drawn in the language of the first
section. Whereas privileges or immunities refers to citizens only,
the other guarantees refer to persons. And the issue that must
come up and I think the issue that is implicated by your concern is
whether that concept of person extends, as you have put it, to an
unborn child.

  Senator HUMPHREY. IS an unborn child a human being?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, again, I think that is the kind of
definitional issue that can only be discussed in the specifics of the
kind of litigation which I cannot get into this afternoon.
  Senator HUMPHREY. It is hard to believe that the offspring of a
human being can be anything other than a human being. I have
never in my life seen such a strained effort to rule out of the
human race by legalistic means a whole class of human beings. It
is shocking. It is shocking. And it is shocking how far this dishones-
ty has been extended to the point where it has raised all kinds of
inconsistencies in our law. It is undermining the respect for our
law.
  All of the rights and all of the weight have so far been assigned
to the mother, and nothing whatever in the law protects the
unborn child, even on the day prior to natural birth. It is pretty
shocking.
  Senator Grassley has raised with you what he and I and others
regard as dangers raised by cases such as Missouri v. Jenkins,
where the Court seemed to have declared that they have the power
to order State and local governments to impose new taxes or to in-
crease taxes. Do you see in that any violation of the separation of
powers?
  Judge SOUTER. The case involves, really, two separate concepts. It
involves the concept of federalism, and as Justice Kennedy's opin-
ion pointed out very explicitly, it involved the question of whether,
given the separation of powers as we recognize it, the judicial
power can be construed to include the order in question, the inevi-
table result of which was that State officials raise taxes, so there is
no question there is such an issue in the case.
  Senator HUMPHREY. YOU do not see a distinction, do you, between
the courts somehow directly raising taxes, on the one hand, and on
the other, causing them to be raised, ordering them to be raised?
                                                276

  Judge SOUTER. I think, again, that was a distinction which I
know Justice Kennedy felt was a specious distinction.

  Senator HUMPHREY.. Yes.
  Judge SOUTER. NO doubt, of the case or its aftermath as the
result of any congressional legislation is before the Court, that will
be a distinct issue.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I have not been present for the entirety of
these hearings, but I do not recall so far hearing from you, Judge
Souter, any substantial concern raised about judicial usurpation of
the legislative powers. Have I missed anything in these several
days?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, we have had several discussions on the
problems which focused on 14th amendment enforcement. I think
that has probably been the subject of our discussion on the matter
up to this point.
  Senator HUMPHREY. On Friday, you had high praise for Justice
Brennan. Do you have any problem with Justice Brennan's views
on capital punishment? Do you see them as being consistent with
the Constitution and precedent?
  Judge SOUTER. I think as far as I can go on that subject is what I
have indicated so far, that, of course, I recognize that, as a simple
matter of the text, the Constitution of the United States recognizes
capital punishment. Beyond that, given the fact that there will be
capital punishment cases before the Court and I believe are on its
docket now, I do not think I can go very far on a discussion, with-
out getting into something that is going to be before the Court.
  Senator HUMPHREY. But you do acknowledge that the Constitu-
tion comprehends, anticipated capital punishment?
  Judge SOUTER. It does so by express preference.
  Senator HUMPHREY. That is one point on which you and Justice
Brennan very significantly disagree, it would seem.
  Well, I would like to address this murky subject of privacy
rights. Where do they begin and where do they end, and how do
you know?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think where they begin is in the several
textural references in the Constitution to the assumption that
there are some rights not expressly enumerated. As I said to you,
my thinking on the subject goes back to the State constitutions
which form a preface to the National Constitution of 1787, includ-
ing our own, with its recognition of unenumerated liberty interests.
It includes the express reservation in the ninth amendment.
  As I said, I have found as a matter of our constitutional history
that, given the other interpretations that have been placed or in-
terpretations that have been placed on other sections of the provi-
sions of section 1 of the 14th amendment, that the appropriate
place to focus a question about the existence of a particular unenu-
merated right is with reference to the liberty clause of the 14th
amendment or of the fifth amendment.
  What we have to find, what we are looking for, when we raise a
question as to whether a given right is protected as fundamental
liberty, is the kind of question on which I said I preferred the ap-
proach of the late Mr. Justice Harlan above all others, and that is
we are making a search on his approach into the principles that
may be elucidated by the history and tradition of the United
                                               277

States, and ultimately the kind of search that we are making is a
search for the limits of governmental power, because it seems to
me if there is one point that is clearly established by both State
and National constitutional history, it is that the powers of the
Government were not intended to be unlimited, that the grant of
legislative power was intended to have limits, and those limits are
reflected in the liberty concept.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Regarding Griswold, and I am not arguing
with the outcome, I just want to cite some of the language from the
majority opinion: "The foregoing cases suggest that specific guaran-
tees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras formed by emanations
from those guarantees that help give them life and substance."
What do you think of that language?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, as I said, I think the first time the subject
came up, I would not adopt as a kind of personal view any of the
particular opinions in the Griswold case. My preference was for
Justice Harlan's approach, rather than the approach that Justice
Douglas embodied in the opinion that most members of the Court
joined in.

  Senator HUMPHREY. I would just like to say that if you cannot
ever find a better explanation than penumbras formed by emana-
tions, maybe you ought to conclude that you ought to leave it to
the legislative body to deal with it. I mean that is real rot gut. Pe-
numbras formed by emanations, that is constitutional law? By
gosh, that is an expression of some kind of philosopher king, it
seems to me.

  What objective external standards are there to guide Supreme
Court Justices in the declaration of new privacy rights, Judge
Souter?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, let me say two things: In the
search for a content to the concept of privacy, we are not really
looking for something new, as opposed to something which the con-
stitutions assumed. We are looking for the principle that was in-
tended to be recognized.

  The material on which we are going to base our conclusions is
basically the corpus of material that we regard as reliable evidence
about the understanding of the limits of State or, in appropriate
cases, national power. Those limits in those materials include ev-
erything from things like Federalist Papers, debates, philosophical
treatises of the times in question, which reflected a concept of lim-
ited power, and we certainly do not ignore the precedents of the
Court that over the years have tried to treat with the subject.

  Senator HUMPHREY. IS this an area that you would approach
with caution? How would you characterize your approach to this
area of constitutional interpretation?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I guess I would use the term "care." The
sound is of profound importance, it is not something that we are
going to approach by winging it. We have to recognize that what
we are searching for is a meaning which is independent of our per-
sonal predilections, and we have to guard against reading our pred-
ilections in what we find. I do not know of any other way to say,
except that we would use great care in that enterprise, as we
would in any interpretive enterprise on anything as of profound

and ultimate political importance to us as the meaning of the Con-
stitution.

   Senator HUMPHREY. DO you suppose there are any more profound
privacy rights lurking out there in the penumbra formed by ema-
nations?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I am not going to--as I said, I do not neces-
sarily adopt the penumbral emanation terminology in my approach
to things, but there is no question that, over the course of the next
decade or decades, the scope of privacy will be explored in Court
decisions, but we do not know until we have done the exploration.
We cannot sit here with kind of an easy theoretical premise which
is going to give us answers.

  Senator HUMPHREY. I do hope you will approach this with great
caution and conservatism and leave to the legislative branch, the
elected branches the primary responsibility for amending the Con-
stitution.

  Judge SOUTER. I appreciate that, sir.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I have a few minutes left, so I want to ex-
plore one further area. You mentioned a moment ago the necessity
of consulting contemporary treatises, speeches and so on. In the
broader context of
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Senator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Point of clarification. You say "contemporane-
ous" or "contemporary?"
  Judge SOUTER. Contemporary.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Which did I say?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, you said it correctly. I just want to make
sure
  Judge SOUTER. I think that is what I said. That is what I recall
saying.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I was just asking. I was not challenging, I
was just not certain. Thank you.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, going back to the--the Constitution, of
course, is contemporaneous with the Declaration of Independence,
and the Federal Constitution is contemporaneous with the early
State constitutions, all of which explicitly posited the belief in in-
herent rights.
  If we are endowed by our creator with certain inherent rights,
among which is the right to life, is it possible that we are endowed
at birth or endowed by ability or endowed in the second trimester
or the first or in some other nice convenient spot, or is it more logi-
cal, in your opinion, that we are endowed by our creator when we
are created with such rights?
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I am afraid that I see that as really a
question that cannot be answered, without throwing a suggestion
on the Roe issue, and I will ask to pass on that.
  Senator HUMPHREY. OK. One last question, I think I have time
for one last question. Is the Declaration of Independence reduced
only to Fourth of July rhetoric, or does it have some operative
status with respect to interpreting the Constitution?
  Judge SOUTER. The Declaration is certainly one of the sources
that we look for meaning on disputed issues. Some of the language,
as you know, that is contained in the National Declaration oflnde-
                                         279

pendence is mirrored in our own State constitution, in its reference
to rights which are not only inherent, but some of which are
indeed inalienable.

  Senator HUMPHREY. And when do they inhere?
  Judge SOUTER. There again, Senator, I think you have passed
that point with me.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, they are not inalienable, in the eyes of
the Supreme Court, with respect to unborn human beings, that is
clear.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before I yield, another point of clarification, if I may. If I remem-
ber from law school about decedent estates--and there is very little
I remember from law school, with good reason, I might add.
[Laughter.]
  There can be vested rights in a child that is not even a glimmer
in the eyes of his mother or father. In other words, there can be a
vested right in a decedent who has not even reached the status, by
anyone's definition, of being a fetus. Is that not correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I was referring to the rule that an unborn
child may take a contingent remainder, if the child is born alive.
That is what I was referring to.
  The CHAIRMAN. But by "unborn child," just so we
  Senator LEAHY. I am sorry, I missed part of that last answer. I
wonder if the Judge would repeat it.
  Judge SOUTER. That an unborn child, a child who was unborn at
the time a prior interest terminates may nonetheless take a re-
mainder interest, if the child is born alive.
  The CHAIRMAN. The point I am making is that the child unborn
does not necessarily refer to a child who is, arguably from the posi-
tion of the Senator from New Hampshire, that is in the mother's
womb. There may not even have been a--how can I say it--a child
may not even have been anything other than a thought in the
mind of a parent at the time the right vests, if born alive, is that
not correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, on the rule that I was referring to, the child
must be born alive in order to ultimately take the remainder, and
the question is the remainder will simply remain in abeyance until
the law find whether a child comes along.
  The CHAIRMAN. The child comes along somewhere, some day.
  Judge SOUTER. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is right, but it does not relate to whether or
not, in the law, whether or not there is a fetus, it relates to wheth-
er or not there is ultimately a child, correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I just want to make sure I under-
stood that.
  The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge, I am going to try to ask you some ques-
tions about issues that have not been raised. I think we duplicated
enough of some of the issues and there have been a lot of efforts,
directly and indirectly, flanking, collaterally and every other way,
to get you to a point and you are pretty good on just not answering
                                                280

it, and so I am not going to try to test wits with you, to see wheth-
er or not you might say one word or two words on the issue of Roe.

  There are still some issues that I would like to inquire about.
One involves an opinion that you wrote in State v. Hewitt, which
was a case where a defendant was convicted of forgery, and during
the trial the judge came to the conclusion that one of the jurors
might know the defendant, so he excused the juror, and the defend-
ant's attorney, when asked, said this was all right.

  The issue arose as to whether or not the defendant had a trial by
jury in the sense that it was not a 12-man jury, from the viewpoint
of the U.S. Constitution and the New Hampshire Constitution. In
that case, you wrote the opinion and you held, basically, that he
did not waive his right to a 12-man jury. Would you give us the
background relative to that in your decision and your reasoning
therein?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, Senator. One of the issues that was raised by
that case was whether--or the issue I guess that was raised by that
case--was whether the defendant was bound by his own counsel's
expression of approval, when the judge decided to excuse the juror.

  What happened in that case is what does happen from time to
time, and that is between that moment and the moment at which
the case was argued before us, the defendant had obtained new and
different counsel and that counsel was then claiming that the de-
fendant was not bound by his first lawyer's decision to accept the
judge's determination that the juror should be excused.

  The issue that we had to confront in that case is whether to rec-
ognize that there are certain constitutional rights of a defendant,
which are indeed so personal and fundamental that they may not
be waived by someone on the defendant's behalf, that they would
be exceptions to the general rule the defendant is bound by deci-
sions of counsel, and we held in that case that the right of a trial
by a full jury was indeed just such a right, and because the defend-
ant had not on the record indicated a waiver of his right to 12, we
reversed the conviction.

  Senator HEFLIN. In your opinion, you recite the split in the Fed-
eral circuits pertaining to this issue and other issues.

  Judge SOUTER. I believe that is right, yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU made a determination to decide the case on
the New Hampshire Constitution?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, would you tell us basically your reasoning
for doing that?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, we decided on the basis of the New Hamp-
shire Constitution, because the New Hampshire Constitution was
extremely clear on the right to a 12-person jury. That was an issue
which had been litigated in the past, I think around 20 to 25 years
ago, prior to the time that we were writing. So that we were in a
situation in which there was extant constitutional law in the State
that was clear and explicit on one of the fundamental issues in the
case.
  We took the position that where the State constitutional law was
clear on a very significant issue, that it was appropriate to rest the
decision on a State constitutional basis.
                                         281

  Senator HEFLIN. Would you give us your general feelings on the
right of trial by jury? It is under attack today in a lot of different
ways. What are your feelings on jury trials?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, my feelings are very strong on their value. I
think I said earlier, when I was referring to some of the experi-
ences that I had had as a trial judge, one of the best of those expe-
riences was simply the continual exposure to jurors. I watched
what they did in hundreds of cases. I talked with them after the
cases were over. I left virtually every trial with an enormous re-
spect for the jurors and the jury system.

  If there are two kinds of cases that I would emphasize that I
found the jurors just indispensable in and dependable in, it was in
criminal cases and in civil damage actions where the determina-
tion of an appropriate damage remedy was a reflection and should
be a reflection of community standards.

  Let me just say a word about my feeling about the soundness of
the jury system in criminal cases. I have heard lawyers, from time
to time, wonder cynically whether, in fact, in front of a jury a de-
fendant really does enjoy the presumption of innocence when that
defendant does not take the stand and testify?

  One of the happy conclusions that I can report after presiding
over hundreds of jury trials in criminal cases is that the answer to
that question is, yes, juries do take that right seriously and they
are, in my judgment, scrupulous and capable in following instruc-
tions.

   I had a number of instances, over the years, in which I would
speak with jurors after a criminal case was over, in which jurors
have said to me--cases in which there had an acquittal, in a crimi-
nal trial, and the defendant had not taken the stand--and I have
had jurors say to me--I never ask jurors questions, by the way,
about their views on the case--but they would often volunteer
them, and they would say to me, Judge, we thought the defendant
was guilty but not beyond a reasonable doubt. We weren't that
sure.

   Those were cases in which the defendant had not taken the
stand. I came away with an unbounded respect for the jury system
in those circumstances.

   I think if I were giving advice to any party, in any case and cer-
tainly to a criminal defendant in a criminal case, my advice would
be, at least in the State I'm familiar with, you may depend upon
the jury's good faith in applying the instruction on the presump-
tion of innocence even if you do not testify. But the one thing you
must not do is take the stand and lie because jurors have an ex-
traordinary capacity to perceive untruth.

   That is advice that I would never hesitate to give. When you
have had the kind of experiences that I'm alluding to there, you
come away a great champion of the jury system.

   Senator HEFLIN. I'm delighted to hear your feelings on that.
  Richard v. McCaskell was another instance relative to a waiver
of a constitutional right in which you held that such waiver didn't
exist. This was where a defendant, I believe, was charged with
writing bad checks or something in this regard, and he entered a
plea of nolo contendere. Later, he was put on suspended sentence.
Later he was arrested for similar offenses, and the issue arose as to
                                                282

whether or not the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived
certain rights when he entered the plea of nolo contendere.

  Would you give us your background of that and your reasoning
relative to that? It is somewhat similar, perhaps, to the case that I
previously asked you about.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I'm going to have to make a confes-
sion. I remember the case of Richard v. McCaskell and I remember
the circumstances from which it arose, but I did not reread that
case in the last couple of weeks and I'm shaky on it. Could I look at
the opinion when we take a break and perhaps address your ques-
tion afterward?

  Senator HEFLIN. Sure.
  It goes basically to a fundamental right that a person has to
knowingly and voluntarily waive, and it's part of constitutional
law, I think, particularly in the field of criminal law that many of
us are interested in.
  You also, in another case which was sort of a unique case, State
v. Vanderhaden, in which a majority of the New Hampshire Su-
preme Court held that the presence of unauthorized police officers
in a grand jury room warranted the quashing of subsequent indict-
ments. You wrote a dissent in that case, arguing primarily that the
criminal defendant should have the burden of snowing prejudicial
effect.
  Why did you reach this opinion? If you can, tell us about that.
  Judge SOUTER. My recollection is that in that case the police offi-
cer was in the grand jury room contrary to the instructions of the
Court. No issue was raised, as I recall in the case, that the police
officer had acted in any affirmatively inappropriate way. The ques-
tion was, whether the integrity of the grand jury system was best
served by quashing an indictment with respect to which there was
no indication of prejudice to the defendant, or whether the grand
jury system was best preserved by, in effect, requiring the Court to
enforce its own orders, and to keep tabs on what was going on in
the grand jury room.
  My view was that in the absence of any indication of prejudice
by misconduct by the police officer that the social balance was best
served not by quashing an otherwise valid indictment, but by de-
pending no the trial court's authority over its own proceedings, in-
cluding the conduct of grand jury proceedings, to police the grand
jury room in that way.
  Senator HEFLIN. I notice that the Supreme Court of New Hamp-
shire gives advisory opinions to the legislature on proposed enact-
ments as to the constitutionality of certain provisions, or the act
itself.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. My State does the same thing. I've realized that
there are a lot of faults with advisory opinions. They are looked
upon somewhat where they're not supposed to be stare decisis. But
advisory opinions are looked upon as being just the opinion of the
individual justices combined collectively. It is not in a factual set-
ting, and I have some criticisms of advisory opinions from a deci-
sion-functioning process as to whether they should establish law to
be considered under the concept of stare decisis.
  Do you have any feelings about that?
                                      283
  Judge SOUTER. I do. That is or was a function of the Supreme
Court that I was most reluctant to undertake. There was no ques-
tion that I had a constitutional duty to do it, and I did so. But the
faults of the system are exactly as you describe them. We are asked
to give opinions on subjects where we have no benefit of any factu-
al record. I don't know how it works in your own State, Senator,
but in mine it is rare, and perhaps--I'm not sure it has ever hap-
pened in my experience--that we have oral arguments in those
cases. They are submitted on the basis of memorandums, and fre-
quently it's the case that we are faced with the constitutional duty
to give an advisory opinion in which one side of an issue is not
even represented by memorandums, and let alone, resting on a fac-
tual record which is necessary to sharpen any issue.
  So we find ourselves giving opinions and we do it sort of with our
hearts beating fast because the fact is we need the help of oral ad-
vocacy. Courts do not do well or would not do well to sit by them-
selves and decide cases without the help of lawyers, and indeed of
pro se parties, and we don't have that kind of help in any system-
atic way in those advisory opinions.
  If you were going to poll, I think, the New Hampshire judiciary
on the article of the Constitution they were most likely to amend,
that one would win.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, in one of these advisory opinions there
was a decision pertaining to a proposal which prohibited gays and
lesbians from running daycare centers, but held that the provisions
to exclude gays and lesbians from adopting children or becoming
foster parents were consistent with State and Federal constitutions.
  Would you give us your reasoning relative to that decision?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, the distinction turned, well, the issue arose
on the question, whether there was, in fact, a legitimate State in-
terest which would justify the legislative decision made in that
case.
  The reason the court drew the distinction that it did, saying that
the prohibition against the operation of daycare centers would not
pass constitutional muster, but that the prohibition on adoption
would, turned on their being an evidentiary basis for the legisla-
ture to hold that there was a role model function served by adop-
tive parents, but conversely that we did not see that there was a
strong argument or an indication of evidence that the same thing
could be said with respect to those who operated daycare centers.
  In fact, as the bill was written--a daycare--an individual would
be prohibited from operating a daycare center even if there were
no contact between the individual and the children, and we found
that that was just outrageously too broad.
  There is no question that I think that case probably illustrates
one of the difficulties inherent in any advisory opinion of the sort
that we've been talking about, and that is we did not have, as a
record behind us, a developed evidentiary record on the role model
theory. The most that we could say is, yes, there were thinkers and
child psychologists who believed that that was, in fact, a proper
analysis. We realized that it was a disputed point, but we believed
it was within the legislative power to make a judgment on that.
  But there is no question that in that case, as in many others, we
might have had a very different record if we had had an actual
                                                284

piece of litigation coming to us, instead of an advisory opinion re-
quest.

   Senator HEFLIN. The United States Supreme Court, in 1984, ren-
dered the decision in Pulliam v. Allen, which was a case involving
a magistrate in Virginia where a person was charged with an of-
fense that did not have any punishment by imprisonment. I think
it was a fine alone. There was a denial of bail, and the defendant
went into Federal Court and obtained an injunction and later ob-
tained a judgment against the judge for substantial court costs, in-
cluding an attorney's fee.

  The issue, of course, arises as to judicial immunity and the doc-
trine of judicial immunity. The Supreme Court, by a sharply divid-
ed case of 5 to 4, held that the doctrine of judicial immunity nei-
ther prevented the injunctive relief in the Federal civil rights
action challenging the decisions of the State judge, nor barred at-
torney's fees awards against the judge.

  I have legislation in the Senate attempting to remedy that, but
without expressing yourself in any matter that might come before
the Court, do you feel the independence of the judiciary--particu-
larly the State judiciary--is a necessary protection?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I do, without question. As you know, Sena-
tor, the threats to the State judiciary, to the independence of the
judiciary are less probably in an injunctive situation than they
would be in a situation in which monetary fines could be recovered
and monetary damages could be recovered. There is great concern
throughout the country about the susceptibility of actions to mone-
tary awards based on actions by the courts which are administra-
tive in nature as opposed to the exercise of core judicial functions.

  The judges, in the aftermath of those decisions, have had to exer-
cise great care in trying to draw the lines between what they deem
as the exercise of a core judicial function, as opposed to administra-
tive functions. But there is no question that there is a threat which
is felt. Whether ultimately that threat is justifiable or not I sup-
pose is an issue that could, indeed, come before the Court again in
my time, but I understand the argument on the side that you refer
to.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU have written a number of opinions on the
issue of insanity and the commitment to mental institutions. In
one case, in particular, you broke with prior precedent and estab-
lished a new burden of proof in cases of involuntary civil commit-
ment. This is the case of In Re: Sanborn.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. In that particular case you lowered the burden
of proof in these types of cases from one of reasonable doubt to one
of clear and convincing. What led you to the belief that a lower
standard was necessary?
  Judge SOUTER. What led us to that belief, Senator, was the fact
that the people of New Hampshire had already amended the New
Hampshire Constitution to provide that in cases in which there
had been a commitment based on what we generally call insanity
arising out of a criminal case, the burden of proof would be clear
and convincing.
  Now, that constitutional provision was adopted in the train of a
series of New Hampshire decisions going back before the time that
                                      285

I was on the supreme court, in which the court had held that,
both with respect to commitments based on mental illness and dan-
gerous propensity arising out of purely civil proceedings and the
same kinds of commitments arising out of criminal proceedings,
the standard of proof required for the State to prove the probabili-
ty of dangerousness, if the subject were allowed to go at large,
would be the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

  In those prior cases, the court had taken pains basically to say
that although the proceedings from which these commitments arise
are different kinds of proceedings--one is criminal, one is civil--
the justification for State action is essentially the same in each
case. It is a concern with safety, both for the public and for the in-
dividual committed.

  What those prior cases had done, in effect, was to put the civil
and the commitment cases on the same footing so far as the factual
and, in fact, constitutional justification for commitment. When,
therefore, the New Hampshire electorate amended the constitution
to provide that in cases arising out of criminal proceedings, the
standard would be reduced to clear and convincing--when, in
effect, they overruled the New Hampshire Supreme Court with re-
spect to the criminal commitment cases--it was necessary to follow
the same rule with respect to the civil commitment cases because
in each case the justification was the same. It was a kind of self-
policing of equal protection, in a way. And so, therefore, we be-
lieved that we were compelled to adopt the--in effect, to take the
constitutional change in the criminal area as a mandate to change
the standard in the civil area as well. It, in fact, was probably inad-
vertence that the drafters of the constitutional amendment had not
expressly referred to both. But, in any case, we had a very simple
question of evenhandedness.

  Senator HEFLIN. There have been efforts, particularly in the field
of legislatures, to file resolutions calling for Congress to call a Con-
stitutional Convention, particularly pertaining to a balanced
budget. There is a lot of debate going on relative to whether a Con-
stitutional Convention, if called, would be limited to the resolutions
in which three-fourths of the States would have petitioned Con-
gress to call such a Constitutional Convention; that is, the specific
grounds and reason for calling the Constitutional Convention.

  On the other hand, there are those who feel that a Constitutional
Convention, if called, would not be limited and could be wide open,
addressing whatever it might choose to address, and whatever was
done through the ratification process could become our Constitu-
tion.

  Do you have any general thoughts pertaining to whether or not
such a Constitutional Convention, if called, would be limited, or is
it wide open?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator, I have never done any research on
the question of whether it could be limited. I have tended to
assume that it would not be if it was called. And I would not in my
present position give advice to the Congress or to the Nation about
what they should do. But it is instructive to remember on the as-
sumption that I have made that when the Convention of 1787 was
called, its charge was to revise the Articles of Confederation. And
we all know what happened. That was a magnificent departure
                                                286

from the intent of the Convention. Whether we could expect such
happy results another time is a question I think everybody had
better face.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well said.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe my time is about up. Is my time up?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU still have 2 minutes, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I noticed, too, in your opinions on the Su-
preme Court, trying to review quite a large number of them, that
you wrote a lot of concurring opinions and dissenting opinions the
first 3 years, but in the last 4 years you have hardly written any
other than the opinions that you have written yourself. How do
you account for the absence of your writing concurring opinions?
Have the issues changed, or is it that you are spending more time
doing something else?
  Judge SOUTER. No, it is not that I got tired or took up another
activity. I would like to think that I probably got a little bit more
persuasive with my colleagues in conference. [Laughter.]
  Senator HEFLIN. That is a good answer. That is all I have. I wish
your colleagues--well, your colleagues probably listen to you a lot
more. It is hard to get them to listen here in this forum. [Laugh-
ter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The judge longs for those days when he was on
the Alabama Supreme Court. But we all do listen to him here,
anyway, notwithstanding that.
  The Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I was very interested in the dialog between the two judges, and I
have the greatest respect for both of them. That is a very interest-
ing part of what you will be doing. I would think that that obvious-
ly is something that you thoroughly enjoy doing. You like that
interchange of judge to judge and discussion of distinction upon dis-
tinction and case upon case and that kind of--I guess to some it
would be excitement. [Laughter.]
  But not me. I am fascinated by that because that never appealed
to me in my practice of 18 years. When there would be a vacancy
and they would say there is a judgeship available, boy, it almost
made me cower in the corner. Many people are aware of why that
would be, I think. There are certain of us that enjoyed the give and
take, and it is always most intriguing to me to hear the discussion
of very able lawyers, who I think would have been great jurists--
and one who is a great jurist, and that is the judge from Alabama.
But enough.
  Let me just say I do apologize for being absent on Friday. I was
necessarily so. I spent the day with two former Governors, one my
predecessor, U.S. Senator Cliff Hanson. And while I was gone, I
was able to watch some of the activity later in the day, and then I
have seen some tapes of the activity. And I can just tell you that
out in the land--and I was with a very diverse group of people
from all over the United States, jurists, lawyers, Medal of Honor
winners, football players--there is a good feeling about you. There
is a good feeling out among those people from all over the United
States who have a good sense of who you are. That has come
through to them. And I think that that is because you are there, in
this very patient way, answering every single question that can
                                                   287

possibly be presented and necessarily blunting some that you just
cannot feel that you can respond to which I understand.

  But I also understand the intensity of my friend from New
Hampshire because I know him well. We came here the same year,
and he leaves now and we shall miss him. I will miss him personal-
ly as a friend. We have had some great times together on the Judi-
ciary Committee.

  This issue of abortion, it has been really the essence of this hear-
ing. I shared with you my views. I think Senator Leahy shared
with you some very poignant personal things. Senator Humphrey
can share those. It is so curious to me as to how our fine country
came to the point where such an intimate and personal and sear-
ingly wrenching decision made by a female about her own condi-
tion and body and substance is the stuff of full page ads and lobby-
ing of an intensity that you can almost hear whirring, by some-
times very thoughtful people, but sometimes--maybe more often,
in my personal opinion--by extremists on both sides.

  Where are the people in the middle ground? Who represents
them? Who are they, people who anguish in and pray about the
terrible choice to be made? And to me it must be the most terrible
choice of a lifetime other than another one that the Supreme Court
will be dealing with, and very soon, and that is the right to die.
That is next on the agenda. The right to life, the right of choice,
the right to die, and, as euphemistically and crudely put, "to pull
the plug"--a terrible choice.

   It is curious to me how it came to this where people come to pray
about this terrible choice they make, but that they need, at least in
my view, to have all of the legal options open and available to
them after the critical choice is made. I am not going to ask you
anything more about that, but it just seems to me that you will
handle that.

  As a person who is personally pro-choice, I don't think that
either side should press upon a nominee their personal views. I
don't like that. And I don't think that is what the Court is there
for, either side.

   I guess I was quite impressed by an article in this week's
papers--Parade, I believe--by former Chief Justice Warren Burger,
who I have a great respect for and have come to know as a friend,
about the questions to be asked in these types of proceedings. What
are the types of questions to be asked? He had his own pungent
view of that, like Warren Burger does about things. He was a re-
markable jurist because he laid it right out on the line. But I cer-
tainly subscribe to what he said about questions to be asked in
these types of proceedings. Are we looking for a superlegislature?
And what are we doing when we impress deeply held, intimate,
personal views on a nominee and insist and insist and insist and
insist that he come up with an answer? I think that is an error.
That is my personal view.

   I hope you go on the Supreme Court. I think you will. And when
you get on there, let me ask you, what will you do when--and I
think Senator Grassley spoke to this--I looked at some of the tran-
scripts--when he talked about creating rights and remedying every
social wrong. How would you approach a case which comes before
you in which a party is clearly deserving of some kind of relief as a
                                                288

human being, but the Congress has just as clearly refused to enact
any legislation that would provide that desired or requested relief?
What would you do?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I would recognize that I was not sitting
there with the power to revise the decision of Congress; and that
the only power that I was sitting there with was the judicial power;
and I would look to the Constitution of the United States.

  Senator SIMPSON. And in doing that really be able to remove
your own deep personal feelings about the issue confronting you?

  Judge Souter. We always ask, we constantly ask ourselves, Sena-
tor, whether we can do that. We have no guarantee of success, but
we know that the best chance of success comes from being con-
scious of the fact that we will be tempted to do otherwise. And by
keeping that in our consciousness, we develop a judicial self-disci-
pline, not a perfection, but of doing the best we can to approach a
level of objectivity and to repress a level of purely personal choice.

  Senator SIMPSON. DO you feel you have attained that in your pro-
fessional career?

  Judge SOUTER. I believe I have done the best I could, and I think
I have done reasonably well. One is never perfect.

  Senator SIMPSON. That is a very difficult thing for me to imagine
anyone really being able to do. I guess it is because of the combat
of politics that goes with that. I think that sometimes it is very dif-
ficult for a person to divorce their deep personal feelings and preju-
dices--and I don't mean that in the racist sense of the word. I
mean that in the prejudice sense of the word before it was tilted in
that direction.

  I think that is a difficult thing to do, and it would require, as you
say, a judicial self-discipline. Is that the way you described that?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. And that comes from your training? That is
something you have learned to do? It is?
  Judge SOUTER. We try and we work at it.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think, if anything, you have displayed self-
discipline in these proceedings, and I could only imagine that that
would be something you could attain in decisions as well as here in
this nomination proceeding.
  I noted, I think it was Justice Brennan, as he wrote, there was a
singular series of decisions off and on that were written with
regard to immigration, illegal immigration issues, when I happened
to be working on the issue in the legislature. In essence, what he
would say would be that--Justice Brennan would say that--he
would admonish the legislature to do its work. He would say: I will
not respond to this portion of the requested relief. This is for the
legislature to do. Admonishing Congress, if you will, to do its job.
  Now, how do you visualize you would press Congress to do its job
when you get to a point and say this decision is not for this Court,
this is for the legislature to do? How do you press a legislative body
to do its work?
  Judge SOUTER. I don't know how you press a legislative body. I
think you do it with the same respectful assumption that you
would like to be given by the legislative body itself. That is the as-
sumption that when an obligation to act is clear, people who have
taken the oaths that we all take will follow them and will act. And
                                      289
I think probably I would not regard it as my business to lecture so
much as my business to record that in a given instance I think the
appropriate time to act is there. And I would, beyond that, rest on
the sense of obligation of the legislative branch itself.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I was interested in your remarks as I re-
viewed them, and the essence of them is, I think--and let me para-
phrase, that you said Friday that it was certainly--you didn't use
the word "regrettable," but it is unfortunate that if the American
people should believe that it is only the Court that really is the
vanguard of protection on a constitutional issue, but that it is also
equally important that the legislature be doing that, protecting
constitutional rights. And I certainly think that is true. But in leg-
islating, whenever one of our colleagues on either side of the aisle
rises to say that is unconstitutional, that is usually looked upon as
the final futile debate. Why, you can't do that; that is unconstitu-
tional.

  I have legislated for 25 years, here and in Cheyenne, WY, and it
seemed to me that, oddly enough, in spirited debate, the final
refuge is: But that is unconstitutional. And then they just trample
right over the top of that poor soul and pass the bill anyway. And
that is not good, but at least the issue is addressed, and then we
talk about it.

  Let me ask you, do you think a judicial decision can be quite in-
structional to a legislative body or to the Congress on an issue,
giving guidance even? Do you think that is possible?

  Judge SOUTER. It is certainly the judicial aspiration. I admit that
I have read some opinions of my own sometimes, and I have won-
dered just how much guidance they gave. But that is our aspira-
tion, and it is an aspiration to a very respectful guidance. We are
not there to tell legislators how to legislate, but we are there as
judges, whatever the court may be, to try to tell legislators and the
rest of the State and the rest of the Nation, as best we can and as
comprehensively as we can, what we believe the law to be.

  Senator SIMPSON. I know that is true. Would you hesitate to lay
out some suggested remedies respectfully submitted to the Con-
gress when you come to one of those situations that is unresolvable
because of your interpretive theory of judging?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I have had cases of my own in the past in
which I have called the legislature's attention to what seemed to
me an unresolved statutory problem which the case before us
touched upon but which didn't require a solution. The effect of
opinions like that is to direct the legislature's attention. But I
think what the court has to be very careful about--again, whatever
the court may be--is in observing the line between doing that,
crossing over the line and start laying out substantive options, be-
cause then I think we are beginning to tread into the legislative
arena. You can't lay out options very well without somebody think-
ing that you are winking on one of them. And that is where we
have to draw the line.

  Senator SIMPSON. I hear that. I think more and more now
though, with the number of things we address and the absolute ob-
sessiveness of picking through Supreme Court decisions, every
word, every nuance and meaning, that it is--I say to me it is--
helpful to have the Supreme Court suggest respectfully, always, of
                                      290

course, that the Congress do this or that with this statute. That is a
helpful thing.

  Would you do that?
  Judge SOUTER. I would try to respond, I would try to make that
kind of a suggestion, so long as it did not cross that line, in effect
saying to Congress what it is that Congress ought to do. I think the
courts can address the fact that there is a problem without trying
to tell the legislature how it ought to solve that problem.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that that is something that is
necessary for any court, and with the three branches of Govern-
ment, we often recommend--we say, well, we think the Supreme
Court should do this. We don't hesitate to say that here and would
expect the same from the Court.
  You were asked about the relationship between the Court and
Congress in specific instances, specific issues. If I might ask a more
philosophical question, one of the Federalist Papers--and I hope
that this has not been asked before because, as I say, I was absent
during the entire proceeding on Friday, necessarily so. One of the
Federalist Papers described Congress as "the most dangerous
branch," and therefore, the Constitution was crafted with the po-
tential of congressional overreaching fully in mind.
  What is your view of Congress in the constitutional scheme? How
does the Court balance the needs for representative government,
proper compliance by all, including Congress, with the Constitu-
tion?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the only way it can balance it is simply by
keeping in mind that there are constitutional values ultimately to
be served and constitutional limits ultimately to be respected. And
I will not this afternoon personally adopt the Federalist language
on that point, but I will say that for anyone who shared that con-
cern, Marbury v. Madison is a happy answer because, by and large,
at least there is a judicial reviewability on the question of constitu-
tionality, and it is our obligation to make sure that that, in fact, is
the extent of the scope of review.
  Senator SIMPSON. There have been some highly technical discus-
sions here on legal issues with regard to, again, trying diligently
from all sides to get you into the issue of Roe v. Wade. And I think
you have done a very adroit and responsible job of dealing with
that. But we get into issues there, again, of technicality that go
back through remainder-men and contingent remainders and fee
tails. I remember those things, fee simple, fee absolute, fee condi-
tional, defeasible fees, determinable fees, and you might imagine
that I had a very difficult time in that course. The transcript would
reflect that.
  Judge SOUTER. I hope you are not going to ask me to define all of
those.
  Senator SIMPSON. NO. The last time we did this exercise, some
minion of the Fourth Estate said: Aha, we want to find out what
your grade average was in law school. We want the transcript.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, don't tell them, Judge.
  Senator Simpson. No, no, Joe, I'm in as bad a shape as you are
on that. [Laughter.]
  And so they asked for the transcripts, and I said, well, I am of-
fended by that. I said I was among the top 20 in my class, to which
                                         291

this one fellow scurried away and he didn't know that there were
only 18 in the class. [Laughter.]

  I had to scratch for everything I could dig out of that law school
experience, because there were 18 in the class and 5 of them grad-
uated cum laude, which meant that there were only 13 places for
me to mess around in. There were five gone before I got to the
table. It was a troubling, you know, and difficult time. And I knew
I wanted to be a lawyer, and I knew I would get that degree wher-
ever it was that I could get it. I did, and then I did sober up a bit
and get serious.

  Anyway, let me ask you this: I think of this because of my own
personal life. The Al Simpson of 18 is nothing like the Al Simpson
of 59, with some very fine, distinctive, solid, stable points in be-
tween. What is the difference in philosophy between the David
Souter of his entry into the 51st year of life today and the David
Souter of 20 years ago just 4 years out of law school? And what do
you think about that?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, the answer is relative, but I think probably
I would sum it up by saying that I have learned something about
the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin's advice. When he was address-
ing the Constitutional Convention and asking them to accept the
draft, he said, if I remember him well, he said, "Join with me for a
moment in doubting a bit your own infallibility."

  Well, I have learned to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. He said, again?
  Judge SOUTER. "Join with me in doubting for a minute your own
infallibility."

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I like that. Well, I didn't intend to refer
to the chairman in any way other than with greatest respect, but, I
tell you, whatever he did in law school--and he referred to it
first--could never have matched the anguish of mine. I will leave it
at that. God, I hope so.

  Hearing you answer questions about cases you were involved in,
decisions you were involved in, things you did, got me thinking of
the things I did in the first 4 years of law practice were absolutely
stupid and absurd. And I am just fortunate I didn't take some cli-
ents down the tube with me. I remember making it right with one.
I just put the money up. I said, you know, I didn't know that was a
nonnegotiable note. I thought it was a negotiable instrument you
showed me. And he said, "Well, whatever you told me, Simpson, it
cost me five hundred bucks." And I remember making that one
right.

  I wrote a Law Review article called "Indirect Legal Conse-
quences of a Felony," or some other trivia of unknown dimension.
And I couldn't even imagine sitting out there trying to define it or
what I was thinking about when I did it. I knew I was just doing it
to get a grade and hope they wouldn't find out how little I knew of
the subject.

  So, but that is there for all to witness, that article, and several
others that are really quite startling. I hope everyone will read
them. They are not published, but they are marvelous. But I hope
we will remember this in the midst of all this, and the chairman
has been very fair, and now we are winding down.
                                      292
  But if we can keep in mind that there really is one, only one
great exercise of the mind here, and it is very simple for lawyers,
and that is to see people go on the bench and see people who prac-
tice law who will assure a just and fair determination of rights
based on the facts and the law of each case that comes before us,
and not do the head-of-the-pin dance, or "what would you do?" or
the hypothetical. Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure: Simple,
just, determination, whatever it is, swift and fair. And that is the
issue. And I think that you are highly capable of that, skillfully so.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  For the record, I would like to publicly dissociate myself from the
Senator from Wyoming's law school record. The only thing I
learned in law school that turned out to be true, Judge, is that the
A students go on to be judges and professors, and the B students
work for the C students. That is the only axiom I have ever found
that turned out to be true. [Laughter.]
  And I don't know why everyone is so worried here about the
Court overreaching. Bickel went on to point out that the Federalist
Papers basically made the assertion--and I think this is Bickel's--
it is paraphrasing him if not quoting him. [Laughter.]
  Bickel said something to the effect that the Court was the least
dangerous branch of the Government. I am not sure why everyone
is so concerned about overreaching of the Court if it is the least
dangerous branch.
  But having said that, let me yield to my colleague from Illinois,
Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, when I questioned you yesterday, I mentioned this
growth idea, and what you might do as a member of the Court to
understand a little more the desperation of some in this country.
Have you reflected on that at all? Do you have any ideas?
  Judge SOUTER. I have. I don't have an itinerary to lay out, and I
know that that is not what you were expecting me to do. But the
one thing that was so clear to me when I was thinking about your
question afterward is what you yourself suggested when you asked
it. You said in so many words that when you had come to the
Senate, you didn't know what those things are that would be sort
of the objects of your own growth. But suddenly you were present-
ed with them, and it was clear to you that there were blank spaces
in your life which you had never concentrated on before. And once
you knew that, it was obvious how to go about filling them.
  I have had that same experience. I never knew when I started
practicing law what I was going to see as problems in society that
would occupy a great deal of my time, but suddenly they were
there. And without any expectation, you knew what you needed to
know or you knew what you didn't know and what you should con-
centrate on.
  I have no doubt that if I should go on the Supreme Court, the
stimulation of my colleagues and perhaps even more importantly
the stimulation of the issues and the cases that come before us will
make the path of what I think I would call an organic growth as
clear to me as it has been to you. That is the way my life has
                                      293

worked up to this time, and I have no doubt that it is going to con-
tinue.

  The one thing I do know from just my experience on the New
Hampshire Supreme Court is that one of the fears that we really
do have to fear is the fear of isolation, which the disciplines of the
judicial power force upon us. And we have to be constantly aware
that we cannot seal ourselves away.

  Senator SIMON. If I could just comment on that, I think that that
growth is not going to be an automatic thing. I think you will have
to consciously be working on it. I think it is very easy, whether you
are a U.S. Senator or a member of the Supreme Court, to isolate
yourself. I think it is much more of a temptation as a member of
the Court. And when the Court is not in session, you can attend
the seminar in Aspen or the one in Salzburg or somewhere and not
really reach out to get a little greater breadth of what is happening
in this country. And I don't mean any disrespect to you when I say
I think it is extremely important that that is one of the things you
consciously be aware of.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, it is. You know, you refer in a way--you
speak of the country. It is only natural when you have been a State
court judge to have that kind of sense of your State as a whole.
You know where all the diversity fits in it. And I would assume
and hope and expect that the kind of same imperative within our-
selves would apply if in your judgment I should face a national ju-
risdiction.

  Senator SIMON. In response to a question I asked on Friday on
discrimination and "affirmative discrimination," the phrase that
you were quoted as using in the newspaper, your answer in general
was an excellent answer. There is one sentence here though that
does bother me just a bit, and I simply want to clarify it. I am not
asking for a response on your part. You said, "The kind of discrimi-
nation that I was talking about in that speech was discrimina-
tion--as I described it, and as I recall being quoted in the paper
about, a discrimination in a sense that benefits were to be distrib-
uted according to some formula of racial distribution." Congress
has never ordered any such formula. We have not ordered quotas.
Now, the courts may from time to time in order to remedy a specif-
ic situation.

  Judge SOUTER. AS part of the remedial power, yes.
  Senator SIMON. Right. Following that, and in a sense following
the question of Senator Simpson about how you are different than
you were 25 years ago, it was just about 25 years ago you were a
law school student, and we were in the middle of the civil rights
struggle. Do you recall your reflections at that point in the civil
rights struggle?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, to a degree. One of the things that it was dif-
ficult for me to understand--this is one of the subjects of my own
growth, this is really a growth question, I think, that you asked
me--is the entrenchment and the commitment in places other than
the places where I lived to the perpetuation of a discriminatory
and unjust system.
  I had grown up, as you know, in an atmosphere in which the
kind of institutionalized discrimination that was of concern to us in
those days did not exist on my street or in my town, and you never
                                      294

really do face those facts of human nature until they are forced in
front of you, and they were forced in front of all of us then.

  I remember the--I suppose no one in New Hampshire could
forget it, but I remember if there was ever one thing that brought
that home to us, it was when a boy from Keene, named Jonathan
Daniels, was killed one summer, when he had gone I think to Mis-
sissippi on a voter registration drive, and suddenly we realized, in
the most particularized way, what the Nation faced, and I think we
could not have realized it before that time.

  Senator SIMON. Let me shift to another area. In 1983, a column
appeared in a newspaper--I do not have the name of the newspa-
per here--by Ed DeCorsi, in which he--and let me just quote a few
sentences: "David Souter was New Hampshire's brilliant young at-
torney general when he addressed the Newport Chamber of Com-
merce nearly six years ago." In his characteristic, clear English,
Souter told that Newport audience that:

  America's determination to avoid a strong central government "has dropped from
our consciousness in the past two decades." That determination, he said, was the
central theme in the Declaration of Independence. In fact, when the States were
considering ratifying the Constitution, the issue was whether a national government
could be tolerated at all.

  By 1978, our prevailing determination had changed. No longer were we stubborn-
ly resisting a strong central government. We were, instead, resisting anything that
would cost us money, and that meant abdicating the local and State control Amer-
ica once cherished.

  He cited three instances in which the State had yielded control over governmen-
tal expenditures to the Federal Government, which had no constitutional authority
in the matter. All of them were causes to be applauded, but he said, "the govern-
ment to which we now look to provide them is no longer the government we con-
trol." They were the nationwide 55-mile-per-hour speed limit, unemployment bene-
fits for State and local government employees, and providing education for every
handicapped person between the ages of 3 and 21.

  Now, the last one of those three, providing education--and the
technical term in the law is 94-142--I had something to do with
creating that, and your neighbor from Vermont, Senator Bob Staf-
ford, was the chief mover over here in the Senate. Prior to the pas-
sage of that, the majority of mentally retarded individuals were not
being given any help by our public schools, and you had two court
decisions or consent decrees that grew out of 14th amendment
cases. One was a Pennsylvania case, the Pennsylvania Association
for the Mentally Retarded v. State of Pennsylvania, and one here in
Washington, DC, Mills v. the Board of Education.

  I would like to tell you that I think that Congress overwhelming-
ly passed this legislation just purely on the merits, but I think it
was also the fact that the Court looked like it was going to say the
14th amendment applies to these people, and I think that is also
the reason President Ford signed the legislation.

  I would be interested in any reflections you have now--1978, this
was 12 years ago--any reflections you might have, looking back,
and then, even assuming that you think you disagree with those of
us in Congress who enunciate something like that, your posture on
the bench. You have stated that, but I would just like to have that
reiterated.

  Judge SOUTER. Going back to the news account that you referred
to, Edward DeCorsi is a person for whom I have unbounded re-
spect, and I appreciated his reference to me in his column.
                                      295
  The only thing that I might question and would question is the
possibility of having left the suggestion that in respect to these
three subjects, Congress had no constitutional power. Congress does
have constitutional power in it.
  I know what was on my mind back at that time 12 years ago,
and it was pretty well suggested by the remainder of the quote that
you referred to, and that was that, because we on the local level
simply are not able or willing to face the problems that are in front
of us, those problems, in fact, will be faced by someone else and our
control, our ability to kind of do our best at home, perhaps with
the least amount of money, is simply an ability which we are al-
lowing to be taken away from ourselves, because if we will not
solve our problems, Congress will and Congress should.
  I am afraid that that rule, if you will, that rule of dwindling re-
sponsibility is just as good a rule today as it was back when I first
spoke of it.
  Senator SIMON. I think you are correct. I hate to use the term
"vacuum"
  Judge SOUTER. I stayed away from that word, believe me. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Senator SIMON. In fact, if local government does not act, the Fed-
eral Government inevitably will.
  When one of your predecessor nominees was before us, Judge
Bork, he stated that what a court adds to one person's constitution-
al rights, it subtracts from the rights of others.
  In my discussion with Judge Bork, I asked about this statement
and he told me, and I am quoting, "I think it's a matter of plain
arithmetic," to which I responded, "I have long thought it to be
fundamental in our society that, when you expand the liberty of
any of us, you expand the liberty for all of us." Which one of these
equations do you find yourself more comfortable with?
  Judge SOUTER. The second one, because I would rather have the
right to do something than a right to stop somebody else from
doing something.
  Senator SIMON. I like that answer.
  Recently, some of us in the Senate got together for lunch and we
had a little discussion. There was at least a semiconsensus that the
basic defense of civil liberties may be shifting back to Congress
from the Supreme Court. Do you agree with that assessment, and
do you think it is a good thing, if that is taking place?
  Judge SOUTER. I am not ready to agree with that. I do not think
the--I know the criticism that is being made and I know that Con-
gress has been very well made aware of its power, as we were
saying earlier, under section 5 of the 14th amendment, but I would
simply be reluctant, on the basis of the evidence that is in at this
point, to say that the Supreme Court is trying to wash its hands of
protection. I trust that is a day we will not see.
  Senator SIMON. YOU were asked earlier--and I cannot remember,
but I think it was by Senator Specter--a little about this process. If
I may be more blunt, what is your impression of this process?
Right now, it is probably one of a little weariness on your part, but
do you think the Nation is served well by how we are handling all
of this?
                                      296

  Judge SOUTER. I think the Nation is served well by seeing me
and by seeing you. Naturally, not every moment in this process has
been totally much to my liking as some, but what I am apprecia-
tive of is in being part of a process and a visible one. You are right,
the afternoon, it is afternoon and I have been sitting here for a
while and I will be here for good while longer, and perhaps I will
be back tomorrow, but the fatigue at the hour has nothing to do
with the value of the process and I am glad that you have had me
here.

  Senator SIMON. Finally--and I will not take my full time, Mr.
Chairman, I know that will be a great disappointment to you--do
you feel in any way inhibited by what you have said here, in terms
of your service on the Court, assuming you are approved?

  Judge SOUTER. NO, because the committee has been very respect-
ful, even in cases in which it may not have agreed about the point
at which it has seemed to me necessary to limit my answers for the
sake of the integrity of the judicial process, and I have been grate-
ful for that respect.

  Senator SIMON. If I can just go back--and this is not a question--
to that first question on growth. I am going to take the liberty, if
you are approved and after you are sworn in, of sending you a note
with a few suggestions that you may reject. At that point, you can
do whatever you want, anyway--but I would hope you would con-
sider them, as you look at making David Souter a Supreme Court
Justice who is as responsive as possible to the needs of this Nation.

  Judge SOUTER. I would like that, even if I do not go to the Su-
preme Court.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Judge.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kohl.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, earlier this summer we celebrated the centennial
of the Sherman Act. For over a 100 years, as you know, this land-
mark measure has protected treasured American principles: com-
petition; fairness; and equality. The antitrust laws are important,
because they have led to a flourishing economy and they have also
led to lower prices for consumers. These laws, as you know, are
nonpartisan. They have been vigorously defended and enforced by
both Republican and Democratic Presidents and, as you know, one
of the most current advocates of strong antitrust enforcement is
your good friend Warren Rudman. And so on his behalf this after-
noon, I would like to ask you just a few questions.
  In your mind, Judge, how important are the antitrust laws in
shaping our economy?
  Judge SOUTER. Well, as you know, Senator, I do come from a tra-
dition that involves Senator Rudman, and it is a tradition that goes
back to the days in New Hampshire when Senator Rudman was es-
tablishing a consumer division in the State of New Hampshire,
with jurisdiction over the State antitrust laws and was bringing
about the passage of a Consumer Protection Act, which I later, as
attorney general, had the responsibility to administer.
  I also have been well educated by Senator Rudman over the
years in the value of small business. Small business has no better
friend than he has, and I think one of the lessons that I have ab-
                                      297
sorbed from a long period of my professional lifetime with him, if I
needed to absorb that from anyone else, is the importance of a
degree of competition which will allow small business to emerge
and allow for diversity in the American economy, which it is the
object of the antitrust laws to secure, as much as that is possible.

  Senator KOHL. DO you agree, Judge Souter, that an important
purpose of the Sherman Act is to protect against consolidation of
economic power and make sure that consumers are not abused by
companies engaged in monopolistic business practices?

  Judge SOUTER. There is simply no question about it, either as an
historical matter or as a strictly legal matter, as one examines the
precedents. The ultimate object of the system, it seems to me, has
to be judged on its systemwide effects. I do not think the antitrust
laws should even be seen as merely consumer laws or as antibusi-
ness laws, but as laws intended to assure a free and open and com-
petitive economic system for everyone.

  Senator KOHL. I believe that the principal beneficiaries of vigor-
ous enforcement of the antitrust laws are consumers, and yet, as
you know, over the past few years the courts have made it more
difficult for consumers to bring antitrust suits. Do you have any
opinions about this trend?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I know I was attorney General at the time
of Illinois Brick, and so perhaps my reactions go back to those
days. By the same token, I suppose I should be weary of making
predictions about who is an appropriate plaintiff in an antitrust
action, because issues of that sort are going to be before me.

  I think the most that I can say is that I do remember the days of
Illinois Brick and I remember when that decision first came down,
and I think you may safely assume that I am sensitive to the con-
cerns that you have just alluded to.

  Senator KOHL. Judge Souter, I believe that the people who wrote
the Sherman Act, for example, Senator Sherman of Ohio and Sena-
tor Spooner of Wisconsin, wanted to help the little guy by prevent-
ing large concentrations of corporate power.

  I am concerned that some judges and other theorists are willing
to disregard entirely this legislative intent, and a few have gone so
far as to suggest that the legislative intent of the Sherman Act
"shouldn't be controlling at all." Do you believe that this ap-
proach--ignoring legislative intent--is a legitimate approach to in-
terpreting statutes, in general; and, in particular, should the courts
interpret the Sherman and Clayton Acts without exploring the leg-
islative intent of their authors?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I am afraid we would be ships without an-
chors, if we tried to do that. In perhaps the more garden variety
cases of statutory interpretation, we are used to looking to legisla-
tive intent to resolve questions of ambiguity and vagueness, when
the statute is not clear on its face.

  But when we are dealing with the antitrust laws, we are dealing
with one of the most spectacular examples of delegation to the judi-
ciary that our legal system knows, and if that delegation is not
going to be, as it were, sort of a delegation of totally free choice to
the judiciary, certainly a respect for the legislative intent has got
to be our anchor in interpretation.

  Senator KOHL. I would like to talk for just a minute about price
fixing, because it is of particular concern to me and many others.
Since the Dr. Miles case in 1911, we have had in this country a
rule that prohibits manufacturers from setting the retail price of
their products sold in retail stores, but some people have begun to
argue that vertical price-fixing should be treated differently from
horizontal price-fixing.

  As Robert Bork wrote in "The Antitrust Paradox," "It should be
completely lawful for a manufacturer to fix retail prices." I have a
presumption that you do not agree with that.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I do not start with that presumption. To
begin with, of course, with the repeal of the fair trade laws, Con-
gress has indicated its more plenary acceptance of Dr. Miles than
was true before, so I think we have an expression of congressional
philosophy on the issue.

  It is perfectly true that, in theory, any manufacturer could also
be his own distributor and run his own retail outlets, in which case
the price-fixing issue would not arise, but that does not seem to me
to be a basis for saying that it should not arise in the economic
world in which we live.

  I will be candid to say that I do not set myself up as an expert in
antitrust matters, as much as I think in some other fields of consti-
tutional law or in statutory law, in which I have a greater back-
ground, and I am certainly going to be willing in an appropriate
case to consider the economic testimony in determining what cases
should be adjudicated on rule of reason basis and what should not.

  But I certainly cannot start with the assumption that, in fact,
there should be no restraint, no limitation on vertical restraint be-
cause it seems to me, as I said, that the congressional expression of
policy is otherwise.

  Senator KOHL. Just one question on civil rights. Because racial
discrimination has been illegal for some time, most institutions do
not openly discriminate. This makes it difficult, as you know, to
prove intentional discrimination.

  Since so much discrimination is now hidden, do you believe that
the proper standard for action should be discriminatory impact
rather than the higher threshold of discriminatory intent?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, of course, as you know, Senator, we are fa-
miliar under title VII with the discriminatory impact concept. And
I think the best respond to your question is that it is an obviously
inappropriate concept for Congress to adopt, and we will adminis-
ter it.

  Senator KOHL. Last question. Let's change direction entirely. Jus-
tice Brandeis once said that "You can judge a person better by the
books on his shelf than by the clients in his office." And I read a
piece in this morning's Chicago Tribune which said that we here
who were talking to you were asking all the wrong questions--that
if we really wanted to know what kind of a person you were and
how your thoughts went from subject to subject and what you have
learned from life, we ought to ask you about what you have read
because reading has played such an important part in your life. So
I would like, as my last question, to ask you about your reading
habits, the things that have interested you in life from a reading
                                      299
point of view, and what some of the things are that you have
learned as a result of your reading.

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I have a weakness for history in my read-
ing. I think oddly enough--and it wasn't planned with this appear-
ance in Washington in mind, but I think the last two history books
that I read were Joseph Lash's book on the New Deal, "Dreamers
and Dealers," and Katie Lockheim's book on "The Making of the
New Deal." And I didn't realize I would be in Washington quite so
soon after I read those books.

  I have gone through sort of periods of reading kicks in both
American and English history, too. I can remember there have
been a couple of summers which I have just sort of set aside and
really bored through things. So there is an awful lot of history
books on my shelves. Unfortunately, the trouble that I find, as I
have spent more and more time on the bench, or at least more and
more time in judicial writing, more and more books don't get on
read, do not get read. So if the day ever comes that I retire, I am
going to have one of the most magnificent unread libraries in New
Hampshire. The stuff is all sitting there. And the only consolation
I have got is I was reading a life of Lord Melbourne, Philip
Ziegler's book on Lord Melbourne a couple of years ago, and he
said Melbourne had that problem. He just couldn't stop buying
books, and they piled up, and he didn't have time to read them.
And Ziegler said that, "Defensively, Melbourne became a believer
in the osmotic power of literature to seep through." So I can only
hope that he is right.

  As I said, I probably read more history than anything else, but I
go on novel kicks. I went through a period in which I read every-
thing of Faulkner's, everything of Fitzgerald's. I haven't read ev-
erything of Hemingway's. That is one of the things that is sort of
there in abeyance.

  And then I read sort of whimsically unrelated stuff. My law
clerks from time to time think I lead too sheltered a literary life.
One of them got me to read "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" a
little while ago. [Laughter.]

  So there are some wild cards on the book list.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU sound like Justice Holmes.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I notice that the National District
Attorneys Association is going to testify here in a couple of days.
They will be delighted to know about "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas." [Laughter.]
  I would hasten to add that the book is about the Association's
meeting in Las Vegas the year before I became a member of the
meeting committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I wasn't being facetious when I said Justice
Holmes has apparently had similar reading habits, and one of the
things that was mentioned, if I recall correctly, is that his wife
once said that he read too many books like "Fear and Loathing" of
the day. At any rate, you are in very good company.
  Speaking of company, I suspect that you would like to keep your
own company for a few minutes here and have a bit of a break. So
why don't we recess until 10 minutes of. Before we do, let me ex-
                                              300

plain what we are going to do next. We are going to come back.
There are some wrap-up questions that could take anywhere from
a total of a half an hour to 2 hours. I don't know. My practice has
been with every nominee--and I am going to continue it as long as
I am the chairman--that as long as Senators have reasonable ques-
tions--and I don't think anyone would suggest we have been
asking unreasonable questions to this point. I will allow the process
to continue. But my guess it--and it is only a guess--that we are
talking about somewhere around 7 o'clock--I am guessing--before
you would finish.

  Now, the ABA, as is the tradition of this committee, at least of
late--by late I mean the last several decades, to the best of my
knowledge, is always the first public witness. They are prepared to
testify today and very much wish to testify today, so I will follow
through with them as well. And your own Governor from New
Hampshire very much wishes to testify on your behalf and do that
today. And so we will take the public witnesses, unless for some
reason we go on well beyond 7 o'clock in terms of the committee
questioning--which I do not anticipate. Unless we do, we will go to
the two public witnesses today and the only two public witnesses,
the ABA and the Governor from your home State, in which case
we will end the hearing for today.

  Now, let's recess for 15 minutes until 10 minutes of.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will please come to order.
  Judge, let me begin by touching briefly on an area I don't think
is a problem--a problem in the sense that I don't think you will
have a problem speaking to, that is, the free speech area--and
briefly discuss with you three areas that are the core of free speech
doctrine. I would like to discuss a little bit New York Times v. Sul-
livan; then prior restraint and speak very briefly to the Pentagon
papers and how Near v. Minnesota was applied; and I would like to
speak a little bit about the whole notion of civil disobedience, in-
citement to violence, Abrams and Brandenburg, if I could. Again,
not seeking an opinion how you will rule on anything in the future,
nor looking for a precise judgment as to whether or not you agree
with the precise reasoning in any one of the cases, but if you will
talk with me a little bit about each. So the issues that I want to
talk about are prior restraint, libel, and political speech advocating
law-breaking or violence, and what principles control.

  Judge, one core issue under the first amendment is when the
State can impose what is called prior restraint--that is, prior re-
straint on a newspaper or on any publication which the State at-
tempts to step in and suppress, like with regard to the Pentagon
Papers, which is 1972. The Government wanted to prevent the pub-
lication of the Pentagon Papers, as you well remember, by the New
York Times and by the Washington Post of classified documents
dealing with the activities of the United States in the Vietnam
war.

  Now, the Government said that publishing the documents would
prolong the war by providing harmful information to the North Vi-
etnamese, and the Supreme Court rejected this claim because it
was not presumed that publication of the papers would definitely
                                      301

cause the harm alleged by the Government. The Court thought the
Government's claim only amounted to speculation.

  Now, Judge, my question is this: Do you agree with the princi-
ples enunciated by the Court in the Pentagon Papers case with re-
spect to the first amendment doctrine of prior restraint?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, the principle being you have got to prove
your harm, and the burden of proof is the highest known in our
constitutional law.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, let me speak a moment now about a case
that all public officials say, particularly when there is press
around, that they strongly defend; but they all kind of hold their
breath, and I am not sure whether they really believe, public offi-
cials, elected public officials primarily. That is New York Times v.
Sullivan. As you know, that case is the one in which Justice Bren-
nan, writing for a unanimous Court, said that the public official
cannot recover damages for a defamatory false statement unless he
proves that the statement was made with what the first amend-
ment experts call "actual malice;" that is, unless the person
making the statement knew it was false or acted with reckless dis-
regard for whether or not it was false.

  Again, Judge, in the interest of time, without going into detail,
unless you would like to, do you agree with the level of protection
that the Court accorded the press in its decision in New York
Times v. Sullivan?

  Judge SOUTER. I think that level of protection reflects the signifi-
cance of the libel laws in modern society. I take that decision as a
judgment by the Court that that was the only appropriate way to
effect the freedom of the press, given the economies of the modern
society that the first amendment protects. And I have no reason to
gainsay that or second-guess it.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, the last area relating to freedom of speech
that I would like to discuss with you is this. As you know, during
World War I and the period that followed, the Supreme Court
looked at what circumstances speech calling for breaking the law
or actual violence could be prohibited by the State. At that time,
the majority of the Supreme Court said that this kind of speech
calling for violence would and could, in fact, be prohibited even
though there was no immediate threat that the law was about to
be broken or that violence was about to break out.

  Now, in those cases, Abrams and Gitlow, Justice Holmes and
Justice Brandeis, as you well know, wrote their stirring and pas-
sionate dissents that everyone who has looked into this area is
fully familiar with. They said that the Constitution allows political
speech to be stopped only when there is a "clear and present
danger of violence and law-breaking." Their dissents were eventu-
ally adopted as the correct view by the majority of the Supreme
Court, and a similar but somewhat more stringent test was accept-
ed, in fact, by a unanimous Supreme Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio
in 1969. In Brandenburg, the Court said that speech calling for vio-
lence or law-breaking could be forbidden only if that speech called
for and would probably produce imminent lawless action.

  Now, Judge, do you agree or disagree with the free speech princi-
ples articulated by the Supreme Court in Brandenburg and at an
                                                302

earlier time the dissent articulated by Justices Holmes and Bran-
deis in the 1920's?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, I have no reason to call them into question.
And as I think you may recall from my answer to one of your col-
leagues today, I have been in the position of giving advice to the
executive branch on the implementation of Brandenburg.

  The CHAIRMAN. That was my last question. I assume that the
Chicago Two, two of the seven or three of the seven, whatever it
was

  Judge SOUTER. We had three.
  The CHAIRMAN. Three. I assume based upon your statement that
you made earlier that they ended up speaking at the University of
New Hampshire?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, they did. There is one subchapter of that
story which I wasn't personally involved in and on which I am a
little vague. But, apparently, as I recall it best, late in the day
when they were going to speak, some concerns with an evidentiary
basis were raised about security, and my best recollection is that
both the State and the sponsors of the speech and the speakers
ended up before the U.S. district court. And I think the judge of
the U.S. district court actually issued an order restricting the time
within which the speech should be given for some security reason
that I do not now recall. But they did speak.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Judge, with the time remaining, I would
like to go back, as briefly as possible--I don't mean that to in any
way curtail your answers, but as succinctly as I can state the ques-
tion--and speak once again to something that has not been acci-
dental but has been a significant subject and topic of interest,
where on the interpretivist spectrum you fall.
  I might add, once again, I might state the obvious, that the
reason I suspect for that is that there is an intellectually defensible
and politically--with a small P; it is not part of any political party
organization--politically active school of jurisprudence which has
as its core, as one of its advocates said, hopefully creating a new
wave of thinking about American jurisprudence, that it generates,
it followed, from the perspective of many on this panel--and I sus-
pect many in the Senate--a relatively cramped reading of the Con-
stitution. And I suspect that is why so many of us are coming back
and answering it. I am not suggesting--as a matter of fact, I am
suggesting the opposite. It appears to me that you don't fall at the
extreme end of that interpretivist spectrum. But that is a very im-
portant question for me to determine and, quite frankly, one upon
which, just as you have to make a judgment for yourself as you
have sat there the last several days as to what you should and
should not ask, there is no precise guidance for us in the Constitu-
tion as individual Members of the Senate precisely what basis upon
we should make our judgment. And many of us have very different
views as to how that judgment should be made by us individually.
  But for me, when I said at the outset I have a keen interest in
your views, the views to which I was speaking were your interpreti-
vist views, not how you would come out on any single case. And so
I would like to pursue it just a little bit more because I think you
have come--I think I understand it. I don't want to mis-state it.
                                               303

  You have explained that your approach is to start with the text
of the constitutional provision in question; and then if the text is
unclear, the judge should proceed to examine not the original
intent, but the original meaning.

  Judge SOUTER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that correct?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, and I mentioned that when I speak of origi-
nal intent, or the intentionalist school, I am talking particularly
about that view that the meaning of the provision or the applica-
tion of the provision should somehow be confined to those specific
instances or problems which were in the minds of those who adopt-
ed and ratified the provision, and that the provision should be ap-
plied only to those instances or problems. I do not accept that view.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then I have correctly understood it. Now, Judge,
under your approach does the correct interpretation of a constitu-
tional provision, does the meaning, the correct meaning, the cor-
rect interpretation, does that change over time?
  Judge SOUTER. I think the best way--you know this is one of
those difficult issues to talk about only because as you, yourself,
suggested at the beginning, it is difficult to state the problem the
way we want to. I think the best way to describe it is this way.
  Principles don't change, but our perceptions of the world around
us and the need for those principles do. I wonder if we do not have,
as a good example, and I know we keep coming back to this, but I
wonder if we don't have, as an example of how this evolution takes
place in Brown v. Board, itself?
  The CHAIRMAN. Good. That is exactly what I was going to ask
you to go through with me. Thank you. That would be very helpful.
  Judge SOUTER. The majority who decided Plessy v. Ferguson in
1896 accepted as a matter of fact that in the context in which they
were applying the 14th amendment there could be separateness
and equality. Whatever else we may see in Brown v. Board, there
is one thing that we see very clearly and that is that the Court was
saying you may no longer in applying this separate but equal doc-
trine, ignore the evidence of non-tangible effects. When you accept
that evidence, then you see that you cannot have separateness and
equality.
  In 1954 they saw something which they did not see in 1896. Now
I will say, as I have said before, that I think Plessy was wrongly
decided, but I also understand that there was a perception which
the experience of 58 years had allowed the Court in 1954 to make
and they saw an application for a principle which was not seen in
1896, and they saw the factual impossibility of applying the terms
of 1896 in 1954.
  I would like to think, and I do believe, that the principle of equal
protection was there and that in the time intervening we have
gotten better at seeing what is before our noses.
  The CHAIRMAN. What really is, in fact, equal protection.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let's pursue this a little further. Let's talk about
the principle, if any, is enshrined in the Constitution, of everyone
of us who have the franchise having an equal opportunity not only
to exercise it, but it having equal weight.
                                                304

  Now, in Baker v. Carr which is early 1960's, 1964, 1963, 1964, in
that range

  Judge SOUTER. I want to say 1964.
  The CHAIRMAN. 1964? They looked back at that principle and ap-
plied it differently than it had been applied any time in our histo-
ry.
  Now, again, explain how your interpretivist doctrine as you
apply it allows you to reach the conclusion, and I believe you do
reach the conclusion, that Baker v. Carr was correctly decided in
1964, when, in fact, prior to that time, the principle was incorrectly
applied. I assume, based on your answer on Brown, the principle
was always present, but the principle just wasn't properly applied;
is that a fair statement?
  Judge SOUTER. I think that is a fair statement. As I said to you
when we were talking in kind of a short-handed way earlier today,
the hurdle in Baker was the argument which Justice Harlan
raised. One cannot deny the power of Justice Harlan's argument,
that section 2 of the 14th amendment indicated an intent not to
apply the principle to the situation at hand.
  As I said, without underestimating the power of that argument,
if I had been on the Court, it seems to me that ultimately I would
have had to have rejected it. But once that hurdle was passed, then
the principle of equal protection or the applicability of it, it seems
to me was reasonably clear.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, Judge, keep your voice up if you can.
  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me try it another way--not try it an-
other way--I mean this is very helpful to me in understanding how
you reason these things. I understand how Boiling v. Sharpe was
arrived at essentially, as you used--I don't have your quote, but
you said basically: these are a practical bunch of folks. How in the
devil could they say the 14th amendment said that you could not
have separate but equal schools in the States, yet, you could have
separate but equal schools, that is segregated schools, in Washing-
ton. Even though the due process clause of the fifth amendment
had been around a lot longer than the 14th amendment, the 14th
amendment only applied to the States. The Court had to go back
and look at the due process clause for its rationale to outlaw segre-
gation--the due process clause of the fifth amendment--to outlaw
segregation in Washington, DC.
  Now, again, with regard to your interpretivist view, I assume
what we are talking about here is that when it is not clear on the
face of the document what the words mean and if you look at the
fifth amendment and I think most people would not disagree with
the proposition that the phrase due process is at least not absolute-
ly clear what it means on its face in every circumstance.
  So when you have a phrase like that, due process, then you go
back and you look at the time this amendment was drafted to de-
termine the principle enshrined in that phrase, is that correct so
far?
  Judge SOUTER. That is correct and it's also the case that I sup-
pose there is no provision in the original Bill of Rights that has
been sort of any more modified in its understanding than that one
has been. We recognize that as a starting point.
                                             305

  The CHAIRMAN. And it has been like a pendulum, its modifica-
tion, but having said that now again I assume based on your an-
swers it's not that the principle has changed from the time the
fifth amendment was made a part of the Constitution until 1954, it
is that by 1954 the Court had figured out the proper application of
the principle--

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think there are two things.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that fair
  Judge SOUTER. I'm sorry. I think there are two things to be said
about that. The first is going back to the time of Holmes. Holmes
said, look, it is too late in the day for us to take a strictly origina-
list view--he did not use the term originalist view--of the due
process clause.
  He said there is, at the very least, or there is a substantive com-
ponent to due process. He would have or did express it in terms of
the principle that the State must demonstrate a rational relation-
ship between the substance of what it legislates and the obtain-
ment of a legitimate governmental object. Holmes said that is
something other than pure procedure and we accept the fact that
that is the way the clause is being interpreted. We don't turn the
clock back. We accept it. So do we all. So do I.

  The second thing that to me is interesting about Boiling and
trying to find the correct application with the principle starting,
let's say starting at the Holmes point, is that Boiling is so often
described as a case which held that due process has an equal pro-
tection component. In point of fact, that description of Boiling
came later. What Boiling was doing was, in the first instance--as
you said a minute ago let us all be realists--in the first instance,
the Court was saying, look we can't have Brown here and do noth-
ing about the question of segregation in the public schools.

  What the Court did in Boiling was not simply to say, look, all
along there was an equal protection component in due process.
They said something very different. They went through a kind of
fairness analysis and ultimately I have always read Boiling as
coming down to this question. We are going to apply to segregation
in the Washington, DC schools the old kind of, the accepted kind of
substantive due process analysis that even the conservatives
accept. We are going to say is there, at the present time, a legiti-
mate governmental object which is being served by this particular
restriction, that is, the restriction on total freedom to attend
schools in an integrated basis?

  The most interesting thing about Boiling is that the Court said,
no, that is not a legitimate governmental objective. Hence, the
Court solved the problem of segregation not by pretending that due
process simply means equal protection but we never noticed it
before. They solved it by doing a kind of due process analysis. They
said there is no legitimate governmental objective to be served
here.

  I have sometimes taken, in my own mind I have taken Boiling as
an example of a general rule that I sometimes invoke and that is a
lot of equal protection cases don't have to be equal protection cases.
If somebody is being discriminated against on first amendment
rights, why don't you go right to the first amendment? Don't worry
                                              306

about equal protection. Say is there any justification for restricting
this person's first amendment right?

   Well, something like that was going on in Boiling v. Sharpe. As
you know, subsequently that has been kind of transformed in a way
and has been put in this short-handed way saying, oh, well, Boiling v.
Sharpe says there is an equal protection component and that is the
accepted view today, but the Court, I think, was more subtle than
that in Boiling.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am not sure I disagree with you on that. Let
me pursue this a little further. In the reapportionment cases or the
reapportionment case, Baker v. Carr, if that case had been brought
up in the Supreme Court in 1869 would the correct judgment have
been, in 1869, the judgment rendered in 1964?

  Judge SOUTER. I don't believe that judgment would have been re-
garded as correct, and it would not have been rendered at that
time.

  The CHAIRMAN. But do you think that would have been the cor-
rect judgment?

  Judge SOUTER. I am sorry, the 1964 judgment?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Judge SOUTER. I accept the 1964 judgment as correct. Whether I
would have been as prescient in the 19th Century as I think I am
post-1964 is something I will make no claim to.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you understand why
  Judge SOUTER. Sure.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sure you know what I am trying to get at
here, which is probably, the audience and the public are probably
wondering what are these two guys doing here, because this will
come off, at a minimum, arcane, if not totally irrelevant. But I
think it is very important because we get eventually down to the
question of when you talked about yesterday--what is the phrase
you used--let me see if I can find the pad--I don't want to mis-
quote you. When you say in Dionne the Court's interpretative task
is to determine the meaning of the constitutional language as it
was understood when the Framers proposed it and the people rati-
fied it as part of the original constitutional text.

  If one were to argue that the meaning of that particular text
does not change, then it is very difficult to figure out how you
could get from 1869 to 1964 on reapportionment cases

  Judge SOUTER. I know.
  The CHAIRMAN. And that has always been my--as you acknowl-
edged when you said, you know--I think I am beginning to under-
stand better. What you are saying here is that the principle was
there. But as society has moved on and changed, the real meaning
and application of that principle has become more apparent as to
what that principle is; the application of that principle.
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, and we understand the significance of facts
that bear on it in a way which we or our predecessors did not un-
derstand a century before. Dionne--well, this is beside the point. I
was going to say Dionne is a slightly, I suppose--
  The CHAIRMAN. I acknowledge
  Judge SOUTER [continuing]. In a slightly different category from
what we are talking about in equal protection because we were
dealing with a far more specific
                                               307

  The CHAIRMAN. By the way I think that is true, because I don't
doubt that. When I first read the Dionne case, at first I thought,
well, wait a minute. Then when I realized the precedents in New
Hampshire and the face of the New Hampshire Constitution as
compared to some of the more controversial and oft debated
phrases within the Constitution that could be given very cramped
or expansive interpretation, like equal protection, due process, lib-
erty clause, et cetera, I realize it is not necessarily applicable.

  But this is helpful. Look, I remember not from law school but
from undergraduate school--I remember a lot more from under-
graduate school--from undergraduate school one of the courses I
remember taking was American jurisprudence. I remember at the
time being struck by Cardozo's judicial philosophy in which he
talked about, tried to deal with the same dilemma you and I are
attempting to deal with. That is the location of the principle in the
Constitution by going back to the time and establishing the princi-
ple, as opposed to a specific application, and then how that princi-
ple can justify the sort--of how he can say that and still justify
changes in application of that principle without seeming to under-
mine your judicial theory.

  He talked about judicial postulance as you may recall. He talked
about the fact that there were certain sociological jural-postulates
and he compared them to cumulus clouds. He said, if you are lying
on a summer's day, as one rolls into view, another one rolls out of
view. It is not a massive wholesale change in application of the
Constitution, but there are very discreet changes in applications of
the very principles that we all like to find precise argumentation
for their existence, so that we don't end up in the position of where
you have ended up to some extent and I have ended up and all of
us, of being one of those awful people who give meaning to the
Constitution that is not there.

  That is the dilemma that we are really wrestling with here, be-
cause none of us want to be one of those judges, or to seek a judge
who has no leash, if you will; who is not at least leashed by the
Constitution to some degree so that his or her personal values
cannot be inserted in the Constitution.

  At the same time, we are looking for women and men on the
Court who understand, to use the trite phrase often used in high
schools, that it is a living, breathing document. That is a fancy way
for saying it has been vibrant and lasting for over 200 years, be-
cause it has been one of the few documents written by man that
has, in fact, been able to overcome the tumultuous changes that
have taken place in the values and in the application of those
values in the society, and still remain cogent, still have some
meaning.

  So, as I understand you, you are not suggesting, if we were in a
debate, I would be trying to make the case that the flaw in your
interpretivist doctrine was that you were, by definition, wrong, be-
cause you go back and look at the text of the document and the
establishment of the principle at the time, and then you find it dif-
ficult to find varied applications of that principle over the 20, 30,
50, 100-year period. But I think you have explained it pretty well, if
I understand it, which is that the application of the principle is en-
lightened by changing facts and circumstances in society.
                                      308
  Judge SOUTER. Of course, it is.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that fair?
  Judge SOUTER. I think that is a good way of putting it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I want to pursue this a little bit longer.
They gave me a sign that 5 minutes is up. I think this is very, very
helpful to me. I realize that it is boring to everybody else, and I
hopefully think it is of some consequence to those scholars are won-
dering as much as I am as to how the application of your basic con-
ceptual framework within which you view the Constitution is ap-
plied.
  With that and without further giving justification for my ques-
tioning, why don't I stop and yield to my colleague from South
Carolina, and I will come back just for a few minutes after this is
over.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I do not think I have any-
thing else at this time. I reserve my rights at a later time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like, if I could, judge, come back to where we were a
couple of days ago on the issues of civil rights and, really, the sig-
nificance and the importance of article 5 of the 14th amendment.
  I believe that very substantial progress has been made, in terms
of striking down the barriers of discrimination in the case of race,
gender, national origin, and disabilities in recent time. Over the
period of the last 30, 35 years, the period since the mid-1950's, this
change has been really a result, as you have pointed out repeated-
ly, of the Brown decision. After Brown, Congress began to move in
these areas, and in the 1960's passed laws in a number of different
areas, as you are very familiar with, the right to vote, to ban dis-
crimination in public accommodation, to ban discrimination
against the disabled, section 504, banning discrimination in
women's education programs. That was title IX, 1972.
  What I want to express is some personal frustration with what
has been happening in the more recent times by the actions of the
Supreme Court in taking a look at both what the intent of Con-
gress was and what the statute stated. Different members have
talked about this in related ways, but I would like to approach it in
a somewhat different way.
  We saw, for example, that in 1972, Congress banned sex discrimi-
nation in education programs that receive Federal money. I think
there was a general assumption in the 1960's, on the part of Con-
gress and the President, bipartisan in nature, that we were not
going to use Federal taxpayers' funds to subsidize discrimination.
There were some that, perhaps, had a differing view, but I believe
that that was an underlying basis of the Civil Rights Acts that
were passed during that period of time, and certainly that was true
of the 1972 act. That concept was upheld by a number of the lower
courts, until we had the decision in the Grove City case.
  As you remember, in the Grove City case, the basic concept was,
if there was not discrimination against women in the admissions
office and the student financial assistance office, it did not really
make much of a difference if discrimination existed in other parts
of the university, particularly in this case with regard to women's
athletic activities.
                                         309

  Now, that, I think was an extraordinary conclusion by the Su-
preme Court. Clearly, what Congress was driving at when it passed
title IX was no Federal funds were to be used to subsidize discrimi-
nation, and that was underlying most of every one of those acts.

  Now, the Congress took 4 years to override Grove City, but we
overrode it and it was bipartisan and has effectively changed the
Supreme Court ruling in that case.

  During that 4 years, there were numbers of incidents of discrimi-
nation and gender discrimination that were described to us. We
were unable initially to get the support, it was actually vetoed, we
overrode it, but it took 4 years in Congress.

  Then we find a situation that goes back to 1989, regarding the
Patterson case, where for a number of years, probably some 13 or
14 years, we were talking about discrimination in contracting. The
lower courts' general understanding was that if you are going to
ban discrimination in contracting, under an old post-Civil War stat-
ute, but one that was interpreted for a period of 13 or 14 years, it
was also not going to permit discrimination in hiring, you were not
going to permit discrimination in firing, discrimination on job sites,
and promotions--this was generally understood.

  Then the Supreme Court, in 1989, takes that same basic statute
that had been on the books since the post-Civil War period and had
been interpreted for the 13- or 14-year period prior to the 1989
period, and interpreted that particular statute as only applied to
hiring. You could not discriminate in hiring someone because of
the color of the skin, but, by God, after you hired them, you could
fire them because they were a minority, or you did not have to pro-
mote them, or you could subject them to racial harassment on the
job.

   It just, I think, defies common sense to understand why you
would have a decision that said, look, you cannot discriminate on
the basis of someone's race to hire them, but once they are in
there, you can discriminate like anything against them. Effectively,
this is what the Patterson case said.

   But when I was listening over the course of the last few days,
you talked about article 5 and the power of the Congress to guaran-
tee equal protection rights under the 14th amendment. I think
what many of us have seen in recent times, in these recent hold-
ings--and I am not going to take the time to go through it, because
it is basically repetitive of those two examples--that we have had a
very crabbed and narrow interpretation by the Supreme Court,
both in terms of their understanding of what we meant and,
second, in terms of congressional power under article 5.

   I am sure you are aware, I think our colleagues certainly are, of
the amount of time and the effort required, which is our responsi-
bility to our fellow citizens, if we take seriously our oath about the
equal protections, to try and catch up again with the Supreme
Court, rather than attempting to move this country to strike down
the barriers of discrimination--I mean for most of us who have
been involved, it is across the board, you have heard many speak
about a related subject over the period of the last few days about
this question--are just spending time catching up and holding on
to where we have been in the past, rather than trying to work with
our fellow citizens in the States and local communities, in the pri-

        39-454--91 11
                                          310

vate sector, to move this country further down the road to reduce
all of the discrimination barriers in all different forms. Lord only
knows, we understand full well that you are not going to be able to
accomplish it by legislation, I think all of us assume, but you can
do a good deal.

   Really, what I am driving at is how you are going to view the
statutes that are passed. My concern is that, when the choice
comes now to a closely divided Supreme Court, and you are going
to be really a swing on this issue, as well as on many others, that
the favor has been given not to the Congress and their sense of
trying to fashion a remedy that clearly cannot anticipate every
simple possibility in the future, but is basically rooted in its deal-
ing with discrimination, whether you are going to interpret it gen-
erously or if, as I believe and speaking for myself, that there is a
balance too often in these past Supreme Court decisions, the two I
have mentioned and others, they have made to tip the scales
against a generous interpretation and interpreting that statute to
try and do something about the discrimination into a narrow inter-
pretation, which results in additional discrimination.

   During the Grove City case, when that was the law, we had con-
stant examples of that, and we have found it to be the case since
1989 in the Patterson case, and I am just interested in what com-
ment you might like to make.

  Judge SOUTER. I think there is only on comment to make, Sena-
tor--maybe there are two. The first is a personal one. I have made
it before, but I think I should make it to you, too, that I appreciate
what you said a moment ago about the fact that we cannot, by leg-
islation, erase all discrimination in our society, but we can try. We
can go as far as we can.

  In this process, there is no question that when a legitimate issue
of the scope of protection or the scope of remedy arises, that it is
indeed the intent of Congress, which is the touchstone for deter-
mining what the results should be, not a crabbed intent or, on the
other hand, a speculative inquiry, but a fair reading of Congress'
intent placed on the record, and if I am in the position to do it, I
will engage in that process.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is certainly helpful. I was trying to
get somewhat of a broader concept about this issue, because as we
went over, the other day, your own briefs with regards to the
power of Congress, article 5, in terms of literacy and job discrimi-
nation, you have expressed--that was a number of years ago--some
real concerns about how much power and how much authority
Congress has under article 5, and we have gone over that.

  Now we are really at an absolutely, I think, crucial time. We
have seen the holdings of the courts in a number of different areas
which, as you mentioned earlier by reference, that the Congress is
addressing, and I am not interested in the specifics on those ques-
tions, although they do not involve constitutional issues, but statu-
tory intentions, which obviously has a different rule. But I was
trying to get some sense and some feeling, you know, from you on
this issue.

  As you pointed out, I thought very eloquently 2 days ago, every
time you make a judgement and decision, it is going to affect some
people's lives, and every day that we fail to remedy the decisions
                                         311

which permit, like the Patterson case does, continued discrimina-
tion in employment, people are going to be affected, lives are going
to be affected, families are going to be blighted, and that is taking
place today. It is taking place today, and I was hoping that perhaps
you would express some kind of concern about those that, as a
result of some of these decisions or rulings, are going to have their
lives affected in one of the cruelest aspects of life's experiences,
and that is discrimination.

   May I have the benefit of the Chair for just one final area that I
would like to go into, as a member of the committee. You have
been extraordinarily patient with all of the members here, Judge,
and I for one certainly appreciate it.

   In response to a question of Senator Leahy, just at the end of the
morning, about what would happen if Roe v. Wade is overruled,
you replied that the States would take up the issue in their legisla-
ture. Basically, your reply was an answer in terms of what the
States would do.

   I would like to ask another question: What would women do?
What is your sense of what the impact of this would be on women
in this country?

  Judge SOUTER. I think, as I understand your question, you are
asking can anything but a free choice system, in fact, be enforced,
a right to choose is anything but a right to choose system, as a
practical matter, enforceable in this country, and the fact is I do
not know the extent of its enforceability, but I recognize the prob-
lem that you raise by your suggestion.

   Senator KENNEDY. Well, the problem, I suppose, would be for
women in this country that did not have the resources to go to an-
other country or to go to another State, would be left with this
heart-rending decision about whether to carry to term or, in this
case, violate the law in their State and risk, in a very important
and significant way, their own lives.

   I was just interested in what kind of gut reaction you have to
that kind of dilemma that would face women, if this decision was
altered, or if it was so shaped or trimmed so effectively, that it was
just sort of a shell left out there, without real kind of meaning.

  Judge SOUTER. I do not suppose, Senator, that there is any more
moving example of the application of what I did try to say the
other day, that whatever the Court does, someone's lives, and
indeed thousands of lives, will be affected, and that fact must be
appreciated.

   Senator KENNEDY. NO further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  Thank you very much, Judge.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch?
  Senator HATCH. I will only take a second. I just want to say to
you that I think you have outlined pretty carefully your standards
of statutory construction. You know, with regard to some of the
points that Senator Kennedy was making, yes, the administration,
myself and a whole raft of others, were for the overrule of the Pat-
terson v. McLean case.
  On the other hand, you know, back to Grove City, when Grove
City was decided, it decided that title IX did not apply institution-
wide, because they actually read the actual language of the statute
                                          312

and the statute was clear as a bell on that issue. The Supreme
Court decided it the way we wrote it up here, which is the way I
think the Supreme Court has to decide issues.

   It was not two hours after the Supreme Court decided that, that
we had discussions with the White House, suggesting that we
really ought to apply title IX institution-wide, and President
Reagan agreed and said, you bet, it ought to apply institution-wide.
So, it was necessary, because the Court ruled properly on the
actual precise language of the statute that we passed up here, well-
intentioned and well-meaning and some thought applied institu-
tion-wide, but the language was just as clear as a bell.

   It became necessary for us to pass another statute. Now some of
us up here would like the Supreme Court to just do those correc-
tions for us. If you think it should apply institution-wide, regard-
less of what the statute says, you apply it. You just actively make a
new ruling from the bench and just redo the statute right from the
bench.

   Now, unfortunately, that isn't the way the Supreme Court
should act. If we're going to pass stupid statutes that aren't written
properly, I think you have got to construe those statutes in accord-
ance with what we've passed, and if you don't do that, where is the
law? How can you have any deflniteness in law?

   So all the criticism of the Supreme Court, I think, was misplaced.
It should have been criticism of the Congress. By the way even
though Reagan and myself and a whole raft of others said, yes, we
should apply title IX institution-wide, there should be no sex dis-
crimination against women anywhere, we could have done that in
10 seconds on the floor. Both Houses would have passed it. It would
have been through.

  We wouldn't have had to have all this anguishing about the Su-
preme Court missing what the statute said. They came up with a
big Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1984. It went way beyond any-
thing that was contemplated in title IX. Consequently, that was
fought and it was stopped.

  When it was rebrought up in 1988, 4 years later, it was a consid-
erably different statute because most of the principles that were
thought to be changed in the statute in 1984 had been changed in
1988.

  That is what the legislative process is all about. It is that you
don't just buy whatever anybody comes up with, but you, as a Su-
preme Court Justice--I don't think you have the right to just re-
write the statute because some of our people up here of the more
liberal persuasion love to see that done, especially when it is re-
written in a liberal way, which has been the case for most of the
last 50 years.

  I think we have got to understand here that the Supreme Court
is limited. If it wants to have consistency in the law, the Supreme
Court is going to have to apply the law as written by these wonder-
ful elected people up here on Capitol Hill who sometimes foul it up
so badly that I am sure that you, as a Supreme Court Justice, will
want to rewrite it in an activist way. I am also equally sure, or at
least feel equally sure that you are going to not do that. You are
going to look at the statute and try to interpret it the way we in-
                                      313
tended it when we wrote it, and frankly, in accordance with the
actual language of the statute.

  It is nice to complain about the Patterson case, but nobody dis-
agrees. It goes back to Runyon v. McCrary and that whole set of
cases. Administration agreed to overrule Patterson right away. We
are still in a tremendous lock-jaw battle over the so-called Civil
Rights Act of 1990 because some believe that the Ward's Cove case
overruled the sacrosanct Griggs v. Duke Power case. Even though
they said we just want to go back to the Griggs ruling, when we
offered the exact Griggs language to them, it was not good enough.
They wanted to go beyond it. It was another chance to use a civil
rights bill to go far beyond what they originally said they wanted
to do, you see, and overrule not only Ward's Cove but Griggs too.

  Frankly, I don't think that there was a Justice on that Court
that thought they were doing anything but complementing Griggs
and extending the rule of Griggs. Now, whether that is so or not,
that's the way it looks to me.

  So you are going to have lots of these problems when you become
a member of the Supreme Court. I suggest to you that if your rule
of statutory construction is to do what your gut tells you to do,
rather than what that language says, to ignore what Congress
really said, then I think you are going to be a lousy Supreme Court
Justice. There will be no definiteness about the law, and there will
be no real way of knowing where we are going with regard to
American jurisprudence.

  Frankly, that has been the problem over much of the last 35
years, maybe as long as 50 years. We have activist judges doing
whatever they feel ought to be done rather than what the language
says.

  Now, one of the things that impresses me so much about you,
Judge Souter, is that you have a heart. You are willing to listen.
You'll find some innovative ways of seeing that things are done
right, and maybe there are some legitimate innovative ways that
Patterson v. McLean could have been overruled by the Supreme
Court, not decided to begin with, but the fact of the matter is I be-
lieve you will apply the law as written. If Congress makes a mis-
take and Congress doesn't do what is right, Congress will have to
take the responsibility for it and not bank on the Supreme Court
rewriting the statute so that Congress is off the hook.

  We are going to have to go through the battles that we did on
the Civil Rights Restoration Act that took 4 years until we finally
got the bill which was considerably different from what I consid-
ered to be a reprehensible bill filed back in 1984, and what many
people today look back and say really was an overreach.

  Now, we are going through that right now in the so-called Civil
Rights Act of 1990, a tremendous overreach. Everybody knows it,
but it has got the term "civil rights" on it and therefore a lot of
people just roll over and say, I'm just not going to be against the
civil rights bill even if it really isn't right.

  Now, I have been impressed--and I don't want to take any more
time because I think you have been here long enough and you have
gone through enough pain here. You have answered the questions
forthrightly. You have answered them intelligently, intellectually,
in a very, very forthright and good way.
                                          314

   I think you have impressed everybody up here, regardless of
what our different ideological viewpoints may be. I want to tell you
that I believe you are going to make a great Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. I believe the reason you are is because you are not
going to substitute your own notions of what you think the law
ought to be for what it really is and for what the elected represent-
atives have put on the books. I think that is going to be a very,
very good thing even though both sides up here make tremendous
mistakes in legislative enactments.

   I just want to wish you the very best and tell you that I very
greatly respect the testimony that you have given over these last 3
days. You deserve the respect of everybody in America, and I wish
you well on that Supreme Court and I believe that we shouldn't
drag this out any longer. We ought to get you on there so that you
can sit on the first Monday in October and start participating in a
way that I think everybody will be pleased with.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, as you have just learned, one man's inno-
vative ways is strict construction and another man's application of
innovative ways is judiciary running rampant. I think you have
found that out by talking to us all up here. Judicial activism is in
the eye of the beholder. That seems to me--as the Senator from
Utah just pointed out, he knows you will be innovative and if you
are innovatively conservative you will be a strict constructionist.

  Senator HATCH. We will certainly be pleased. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. If you are innovatively liberal, you will be run-
ning rampant and the flip will be reversed. But anyway
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, can I just say one other thing?
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Senator HATCH. I would like to just personally express my appre-
ciation to the chairman. I think--not for his recent comments, be-
cause that is really wrong. [Laughter.]
  But I would like to express appreciation to him and his staff be-
cause I think they have, thus far, run very fair and open hearings
here and I think the hearings have run very smoothly because of
the chairman and the approach that he has taken. I want to per-
sonally be on record as expressing appreciation to him for the lead-
ership he has provided here. I certainly have enjoyed being here.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's very gracious.
  Senator THURMOND. We are not through yet.
  Senator HATCH. NO, but that may be the last time I get to say it.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate it very much, and the Senator from
South Carolina will agree with that or disagree with it based on
whether I vote for you or against you. [Laughter.]
  The Senator from Vermont, do you have any further questions?
  Senator LEAHY. I do have a couple, Mr. Chairman, and I also will
concur in the facts. You have run the hearings very fairly and
evenly, and you might say when Senator Hatch announced earlier
that he was only going to give you a 1-minute lecture, don't feel,
Judge, you got the whole load. I suspect that Senator Hatch was
directing that lecture as much to some of his 99 colleagues in the
Senate as he was to current or potential members of the U.S. Su-
preme Court.
                                         315

  Also, understand that some of us have heard the lecture before,
but whether you live up to it or not will, of course, be in the eye of
the beholder and that will change depending upon how you rule in
close cases.

  Let me go to a couple of specifics. Going over the criminal law
cases that you were involved in--and I admit, based on my own
past experience, those things have always jumped out at me, I
would like to talk about State v. Valenzuela. I may have not pro-
nounced that the correct way, but I believe you know the case as
one where you ruled that the use of a pen register without a war-
rant was legitimate?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
   Senator LEAHY. For those who are not aware, a pen register
traps telephone numbers of outgoing calls. Now, I understand the
U.S. Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in Smith v. Mary-
land?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
   Senator LEAHY. SO you are basically following what the Supreme
Court had decided. Did you follow Smith v. Maryland because that
is the way the Supreme Court ruled or did you follow it because
you also agreed with it?
  Judge SOUTER. We followed it because we agreed with it. The
case in Valenzuela, and that is the way I pronounce it too, was a
case which was--or an issue in this respect that was raised under
the State constitution because the defendants who raised the issue
knew that Smith had been decided, so that so far as their Federal
grounds were concerned they realized that they did not have any
possibility of obtaining relief.
   The peculiar aspect of the Valenzuela case was that in raising
the issue under the State constitution of whether or not a pen reg-
ister recording was a search, they made the assumption that the
New Hampshire Supreme Court had accepted as its sort of frame-
work for analyzing search and seizure problems the same basic
premise that the U.S. Supreme Court had adopted in Katz v.
United States, which was the reasonable expectation of privacy
theory.
   In point of fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court had never
adopted that theory as its kind of unifying search and seizure
theory. But, in any event, there being no disagreement, we simply
took the case on the assumption that assuming arguendo that a
Katz reasonable expectation of privacy analysis is going to apply, is
there any good reason to come out differently under the State con-
stitution on that theory from the way that the U.S. Supreme Court
did under the fourth amendment on Smith v. Maryland?
   Senator LEAHY. Well, the reason I asked, Judge, I am just inter-
ested in what expectation of privacy you believe a person has with
regard to the phone numbers he dials? Now, as I understand, and
correct me if I am wrong on this, in that case the defense assumed
that article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution would apply to
wiretapping. You said the New Hampshire Supreme Court never
actually decided what the appropriate scope of privacy was under
article 19.
   You did mention Katz. In construing article 19 could, you have
read it more narrowly? Let us take this step by step. Could you
                                      316
have construed article 19 more narrowly than the Supreme Court
read the fourth amendment in Katz?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I don't know whether we could have reason-
ably or correctly done that, but the issue is, in theory, open in New
Hampshire, so that I suppose that as a theoretical possibility, yes.
Whether it would be a sound decision when and if the Court
reaches it is not something I would make any suggestion on, but in
theory, yes.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU don't think the supremacy clause would re-
quire you to construe article 19 at least as broadly as the fourth
amendment?

  Judge SOUTER. I think I would draw this distinction, Senator: the
supremacy clause would not require us to construe the State consti-
tution as broadly, but if we construed it in a way that, in fact, af-
forded less right to a defendant, the New Hampshire Constitution
would, in that respect, be inoperable because under the supremacy
clause the fourth amendment standard would always be the one
that would apply and would govern.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall--I should have noted and given
you a chance to read this before, but do you recall Justice Black's
position in the Katz dissent?

  Judge SOUTER. I have not reread it, but my recollection is that
Justice Black said when you are trying to carry the fourth amend-
ment to intangibles like conversations you are carrying it beyond
its terms. Justice Black was a very strict textualist, and my recol-
lection is that was the basis for his decision in that case, although I
have not read it in a long time.

  Senator LEAHY. I have one quote from him which I did pull out
which bears out what you say about being very, very strict on this.
He said: "Since I see no way in which the words of the fourth
amendment can be construed to apply to eavesdropping, that closes
the matter for me. I will not distort the words of the amendment in
order to keep the Constitution up to date."

  He said the fourth amendment protects privacy only to the
extent that it prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of per-
sons, houses, papers and effects. He refused to extend it to seizure
of a voice by means of a wiretap. Do you agree with that?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, Justice Black was saying that you cannot
have a search without some tangible to be seized. I guess I do not
think that is a self-evident proposition.

  Senator LEAHY. Did you agree with his position at the time of
Valenzuela?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, we didn't agree with it, but we were not
asked to agree with it. The issue was not placed before us.

  Senator LEAHY. The reason I asked that is that in your own deci-
sion you singled out Justice Black's dissent and I was wondering
what your view was at that time, why you picked out Hugo Black's
dissent?

  Judge SOUTER. I picked it out simply because we were signaling
the bar of the fact that a unifying principle in a decision that
would indicate the ultimate scope of the article had never been
rendered, and we simply said that when and if the time comes that
the Court is asked to adopt, let's say, the reasonable expectation of
                                         317

privacy analysis, there are competing views. Therefore, those views
are going to have to be considered before we make a decision.

  But there was no intention there to indicate that the Court was
likely to agree with Justice Black or to go in any particular direc-
tion.

  Senator LEAHY. I am sorry, I didn't hear that last comment.
  Judge SOUTER. I was going to say that I think there was nothing
in the opinion that was meant to indicate that the Court was likely
to agree with Justice Black and to go in his direction if the issue
was raised. We simply said that the issue has never been raised
and there is disagreement about it.

  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you look at Justice Black's dissent
today?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, as I said, I haven't reread it before coming
in here, but I don't necessarily accept the proposition that you
can't have a regulated search without an intangible to be seized.
That was Justice Black's premise.

  Senator LEAHY. I have two brief followup questions. Senator
Biden asked whether under a privacy analysis rather than an
equal protection analysis a State could ban the sale of contracep-
tives to unmarried adults. You responded--and correct me if I'm
wrong, as I'm just trying to summarize your response--that it
would be a difficult question that would require you to weigh the
privacy rights of the individual against the countervailing interest
of the State. Is that a fair statement of your response?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, if you found an interest subject to potential
protection. As you know, in the Eisenstadt case, because it was an
equal protection case, the Court did not go through the kind of due
process analysis that would inform sort of your first premise there,
and I have not gone through it, either.

  Senator LEAHY. Does that mean that equal protection
  Judge SOUTER. The case has not been decided.
  Senator Leahy [continuing]. Aside, the State could ban the sale
of contraceptives to unmarried adults?
  Judge SOUTER. The case has not been decided and the privacy
analysis that would be its first step simply has not been done. I
have not done it and the Supreme Court of the United States has
not done it. That is an open question. Eisenstadt, as I recall, and I
think I said before, I did not reread Eisenstadt before coming in
here and I wish I had, but my recollection is that Eisenstadt went
on straight equal protection grounds. I could be wrong on that, but
I thought it did.

  Senator LEAHY. Last, Judge--I am not trying to get you to
change your mind on this--you told Senator Metzenbaum last
week that you were not going to tell us what you had counseled the
unmarried pregnant student.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. I raised a question with you this morning of
whether that would be different, in light of the changes in the law
today, whether your advice would be different, and you said you
did not want to go into that. I understand that you are not going to
tell us what your advice was, and that is, of course, your choice.
                                          318

   Could you just tell me briefly, because there seems to be a lot of
confusion about why you will not tell us what the advice was, and
rather than us trying to guess, I wonder if you would just tell us.

   Judge SOUTER. Without getting into a long analysis, anything
that I could conceivably say could conceivably read as an indication
of not only what that advice was, but what I was being asked to
address, and I think that would be unfair to the student involved. I
think the possible answers to that question could be a revelation of
some of the things that the student may have said to me and I
think that would be wrong for me to reveal.

   Senator LEAHY. Except that you were, of course, the one who
raised the fact of the student and obviously did it, feeling that
there was no way we would ever know who the student was.

   Judge SOUTER. Well, I do not know whether that is so or not.
   Senator LEAHY. OK. Thank you.
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Simpson.
   Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman and the nominee, I will just
take literally less than 5 minutes and I promise to do that.
   I think that Senator Hatch and I have a unique working rela-
tionship with Senator Kennedy. We are the ranking members of
our party on two committees or subcommittees with the Senator.
His viewpoint is a very passionately held one--very honest, very
real--and we have disagreements and that is what politics is about
and that is what legislating is about, and I understand it and he
described it. I think he used the word "frustration." I think he han-
dled that all very well and I need not comment on it. It was done
in a very civil way and I appreciate that.

  But these issues, this allusion to discrimination, that somehow
you would be prone to discriminate or prone to decide cases in the
U.S. Supreme Court that would discriminate I think are totally
laid to rest now, or should be.

  I would just say that it was frustrating to me, too, to watch
Grove City and Ward's Cove, because the reason Grove City took 4
years to do, as Senator Hatch has so well said, is because all we
were told is we just want to correct it, put the statute back to
where it was. Then we saw a 4-year exercise of overreaching by the
overzealous to drag out every old agenda item that they had ever
been beaten on. They had been beaten on every one of those issues,
but they were trying to drag out these old objectives, old laundry
lists, and put them into the legislation. Sadly enough, if you do not
agree with that and it is called civil rights, you are then given a
few very polite brush strokes that are hoped to indicate that some-
how you are a racist, or not quite as sensitive as others in that
area. That is a very unfortunate turn, and that is why we had a lot
of trouble with Grove City. We were ready to put it back where it
was, and that is why we had trouble with Ward's Cove. And soon
you will be there on the bench speaking with the Justices, and
many of them will simply scratch their heads, when they see the
congressional reaction to Ward's Cove and the other civil rights
cases, because all they were doing was just some very valid correct-
ing of some imprecise language.
                                         319

  But it is going to be a new era and it should not have anything
to do with discrimination and racism and who is better at that
than others or more sensitive, and I think that I see simply the
reason you are going to be approved and serve beautifully on this
Court is because you are a very decent man. You are decent man
who has given every indication that, in each and every case, you
will do a tremendously sincere job with the task that we are going
to give you.

  I believe you properly declined, where you should have, and in
doing that you have gained the respect of the American people.

  I wish I had a question, another question, and I know you would
be very complete and full in your answer to questions on both
sides. I think you have been exceedingly responsive to our chair-
man.

  I do thank him for his extraordinary fairness and that is his sin-
gular trait that I have never seen him deviate from, and I appreci-
ate that, and I appreciate the civility of my colleagues in a very
helpful exchange, and I thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator, personally, and I
thank you for your questions.

  The Senator from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. A part of your duties in the Supreme Court, in
the event you are confirmed, you will be receiving reports from the
Judicial Conference of the United States relative to various recom-
mendations that they might make pertaining to the administration
of justice, changes in various rules, such as the Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure, and the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the issue, of
course, as a member of the Court in which you can express yourself
on the problems that confront the administration of justice as a
whole, including all of the Federal courts.

  While your experience has been as a member of a court at the
State level, nevertheless, you practiced extensively in Federal
courts, and so the issue which I am getting at is the administration
of justice and the improvement of the structure, as well as the ad-
ministration of the courts.

  Have you had an opportunity in your experience to look at the
administration of courts, needed reform, changes that should take
place to improve the operation and functioning of the justice
system?

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I have been so short of time on the Fed-
eral bench that I really have not, although I have made one obser-
vation and I think it may be much more specific than you had in
mind, but I will pass it on for what it is worth.

  I know that I have been living in temporary chambers since I
went on the court of appeals, the temporary chambers are in the
U.S. District Courthouse in Concord, NH. I was talking one day
with the clerk of that court, who told me that his criminal caseload
had increased I think threefold or fourfold in the past, oh, 12 to 18
months. I said why is that, and he said as a result of the drug pros-
ecutions. He said what I have been telling counsel is that you are
coming down in volume, you are coming down a 4-lane highway
and then you are going to get to the U.S. district courtroom and it
is not a 4-lane highway, because there are not enough judges here
to absorb that kind of increase, as a result of the prosecutorial ac-
                                              320

tivity, and the expectation is that there is going to be a very seri-
ous administrative problem in handling the volume of cases.

   What I hope will not happen is what I have been seeing happen
on the State level, and I alluded to it the other day, and that is
that the demand, the constitutional imperative for the trial of
criminal cases in a speedy fashion is squeezing the civil caseload off
the dockets of those courts. And if they stay off the dockets long
enough, we are going to see, and we are in fact seeing now, the de-
velopment of an alternative and private system of civil justice in
this country.

   And while there may be some people--there are undoubtedly are
some people who will say fine, if that can simply be passed on to
the private sector, let the private sector pick it up and operate it
on an entrepreneurial basis, but the price that will be paid for that
is that, in my judgment, part of the glue that holds us together as
well as we do as a society is the fact of a common system of justice,
criminal and civil, and if that common system is lost, then I believe
part of the coherence of American society will be lost, too, and I
hope that is not what we are going to see down the road.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, it may be, and I am not advocating this,
but in order to meet that problem, which I am delighted to see you
recognize, that you may well have to divide courts into criminal
and civil divisions and you may well have to alternate judges, be-
cause you do not want them to get into just a field of specialization
alone. I think the general approach of the Federal judiciary at the
district court level of being generalist has been very helpful.

  Of course, all of those criminal cases and most of the civil cases
are determined by jury trials and, of course, that means I think
that the generalists, because of that, can function exceptionally
well.

  We have authorized and the Chief Justice had a Federal Court
Study Committee which has just recently made its report. It did a
15-month study. It did not cover nearly all of the aspects that
should be and should be on a much longer basis of study. But I
foresee that we are going to have major problems in the adminis-
tration of justice, if we continue the path that we are on, and it is a
serious one. We have got to have speedy criminal trials. I do not
want to take away from that concept whatsoever.

  Nevertheless, overall administration of justice has to be looked
at, civil as well as criminal, in that aspect. I hope that you will give
some study, and I think you bring a unique background to the
Court that maybe some of the other members of the Court do not
have, and I hope that you will look at that very carefully.

  Judge SOUTER. I will, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. I asked you previously, and I suppose you have
now looked at it and I understand you have seen it, case of Richard
v. McCaskell
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Judge HEFLIN [continuing]. It was a case where a person was
being tried for the fraudulent use of a credit card and entered a
nolo contendere plea, and later it was challenged by habeas corpus
proceedings and, as a result, the issue came as to whether or not
there had been a waiver. Would you explain that case and your
reasoning in reaching the decision?
                                      321
  Judge SOUTER. Yes. Thank you, Senator, I did refresh my recol-
lection of that during the break.
  Richard v. McCaskell was a State habeas corpus case. The facts
were that the defendant or the petitioner, actually, had been con-
victed of fraudulent use of a credit card or shoplifting, on a previ-
ous occasion had entered a plea of nolo contendere and had been
given a suspended sentence.
  She had then been arrested and charged against, and when she
was found guilty of a second offense, the district court brought for-
ward the first conviction and the suspended sentence and moved to
impose that sentence. She then challenged the validity of the sen-
tence in the first case by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus,
and her claim was that she had not entered a valid waiver of her
rights to trial at the time she entered the nolo contendere plea in
the first case.
  What her request for relief turned on was the need for courts to
make a record of the waivers of rights which are implicated by a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere. In the absence of a record of such
a waiver, the burden is on the State to prove affirmatively that the
waiver in the first case was, in fact, a voluntary waiver. Whereas,
conversely, if there is an adequate record that the defendant did
waive the rights knowingly and intelligently, the burden would be
on the petitioner to prove that, in fact, the plea in the first in-
stance was not a voluntary one.
  In this case, there was no such record indicating that the court
had canvassed the defendant and had obtained from her a personal
knowing and intelligent waiver of rights, and, therefore, the court
held, in the opinion that I wrote, that it had been error for the
trial court in this case to dismiss the petition for the writ.
  Now, the State claimed that it could present evidence that there
had been, in fact, a voluntary and knowing waiver, but we held
that there was no evidence on the record before us from which the
trial court could have found that, and we therefore vacated the
trial court's order dismissing the write and remanded it.
  So, to sum it up, it was as case that recognized that when there
is not an adequate record of a waiver of these very fundamental
and personal rights which must precede the entry of anything but
a plea of not guilty, the burden is on the State to prove that there
was such a waiver and, without such proof, the defendant would be
entitled to withdraw the plea.
  Senator HEFLIN. One other case that you have written about is a
case of State v. Colbath, which was a New Hampshire Supreme
Court case having two aspects that were I think interesting, from a
viewpoint of the Constitution and individual rights. One dealt with
a speedy trial and the other the rape shield. Would you explain
that case and your position relative to the issues raised by that?
  JUDGE SOUTER. Well, the issue that was raised in that case about
the rape shield law went to the point of the rape shield law, which
is to bar the introduction of evidence of voluntary sexual activity
by the complainant in a rape case, by the victim in a rape case,
with anyone other than the defendant.
  What the case illustrated was the fact that there can come a
time when the rape shield law, which is enacted for good and suffi-
cient reason, to prevent rape victims from being victimized and, in
                                              322

effect, deterred from complaining and testifying, from fear that
their private lives are going to be needlessly spread in front of the
public, will nonetheless come into collision with a defendant's right
to cross-examine and to present proof favorable to himself.

   The general rule had been and has been in New Hampshire, and
I think is in most States that have considered it, that when the ac-
tivity about which a defendant wishes to present evidence is sub-
stantially close in time to the time at which the crime itself was
charged, that that activity probably does have a sufficient degree of
relevance, so that even in the face of a rape shield law, the due
process clause requires that the defendant have an opportunity to
present such evidence.

   In this particular case, the evidence involved the activity of the
complainant in a public bar with a number of men, including the
defendant, at a time within the hour or two before she and the de-
fendant admittedly left together.

  The issue in the case was not whether a sexual act had taken
place, but whether it had taken place with consent.

  The court was unanimous in holding that the evidence was suffi-
ciently related in time, so that it was probably so relevant or po-
tentially relevant that the rape shield law could not prevail against
the due process clause, and we so held in reversing a conviction
which had rested on a jury instruction which included the jury
from considering such evidence.

  Senator HEFLIN. HOW about the speedy trial aspect of that case?
  Judge SOUTER. I only remember that there was a speedy trial
issue in that case and that we found that the speedy trial right had
not been infringed, but, quite frankly, I do not remember the facts
in sufficient detail to know exactly how we analyzed it.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I think basically that a defendant is sup-
posed to have 9 months; the speedy trial rule is that the defendant
has a constitutional right to have a trial within 9 months between
arrest and trial, and a full year lapsed in the case. Basically, how-
ever, the decision of the court was that the defendant never initiat-
ed a speedy trial request and he was out on bail and he suffered no
prejudice from it, at least that was the reasons that I remember
why the case was determined
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. Which brings into issue the Speedy Trial Acts.
They are twofold. It is for the advantage of the defendant, but it is
also for the advantage of the public, and I do not think we ought to
lose sight of that fact.
  I have cited in my questioning of your several cases which indi-
cate that you have a respect for individual rights and there are nu-
merous cases that have previously been brought up in which you
show a law and order approach, so I think that you have shown a
regard for both in the decisions that you have written.
  Judge SOUTER. I hope they will never be regarded as mutually
exclusive.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all that I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania, let me ask: In
the rape shield case, you said sufficiently relevant in time. I think I
know what you mean by that.
                                             323

  Judge SOUTER. Close in time, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is the action or activity, the alleged action
or activity of the plaintiff, the woman in this case, the woman who
was allegedly raped, took place within a time frame that made that
action relevant to the defense of the defendant, is that what was
meant?
  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Thank you.
  Judge, would you like a short break? I think we are going to be
finished, but it will probably be another half hour or more. Would
you
  Judge SOUTER. I would be willing to go on testifying. Thank you
very much.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, I would start at this point with the cases on stare
decisis, which is the phrase meaning to follow established principle.
This is important in terms of your overall judicial approach, and it
may have some special application on the very controversial sub-
ject of the abortion case, in terms of how much impact there would
be from Roe v. Wade. I do not intend to ask you about that issue,
because, as I said before, I respect your position that you cannot
comment on that, because it is likely to come before the Court.

   But as you have outlined your analysis of liberty interests and
countervailing interests, then you added to that whatever impact
there would be on the precedents of stare decisis, and you do have
a number of cases from your tenure on the New Hampshire State
Supreme Court which bear on this subject.

   In the case of the Petition of Robert Coryea, you commented that,
"Once the statute has been construed, stare decisis calls for a rea-
sonable degree of certainty in applying that construction to future
cases, subject always to the legislature's power to modify the stat-
ute itself." And while the statute is a little different from a consti-
tutional provision, I think that is a significant case. I will not go
into the facts there, but will deal with the facts of two other cases
on this issue, because I think they have significance.

   In a case by the name of Cacavas v. Main Bonding and Casualty
Co., you followed a precedent which you said you disagreed with.
That was as case which does not involve facts of very great conse-
quences for this proceeding, but the principle is a very important
one, because you followed a precedent which you disagreed with.

   In that case, you referred to other cases. One was as decision in a
case called Grimes, where there was a stacking of insurance poli-
cies, one policy and two cars, and the Grimes case said that stack-
ing of the policies was not permitted. That means stacking is to
add the limits of both policies together.

  Then, 4 years later, in a case called Descoteaux, the court permit-
ted the stacking of insurance policies, and in that case there were
slightly different factual situations, there were two policies. And
then came the case of Cacavas, and you specifically said that you
believed in the principle of Grimes, but you were following Desco-
teaux, because of stare decisis, not to overrule a precedent.
                                       324

Now, it is interesting that, in a matter of this sort, where the Su-
preme Court of New Hampshire in 1984 had overruled a decision of
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire from 1980, and the case
came up again in 1986, just 2 years later, and the court had seemed
perfectly willing to change back and forth, that you found it impor-
tant to maintain the decision. Why?
Judge SOUTER. Because that case struck me as a classic example
of the kind of case in which there has got to be an opportunity for
reliance upon what the court does. We were dealing in that case
with the issuance of insurance policies. We have obligations to both
parties to those policies to come up with a coherent body of law
which can be understood and which those parties can rely upon in
making their business arrangements.
We simply cannot go back and forth in cases of that sort every
couple of years, and, therefore, I believed we were in a situation in
which the demand for a reasonable reliance certainly outweighed
my concern to go back and sort of rewrite the history of New
Hampshire precedent in the way that I would have done, if I had
been able to do that in the first place.
Senator SPECTER. Well, as a general proposition, Judge Souter,
would you say that reliance on not going back every couple of
years    would    be a principle   of  Wgeandeer1a?l  application  which  would
apply    even to  a case like Roe  v.
Judge SOUTER. With respect, Senator, I am going to ask not to
answer the application to Roe v. Wade, but I can certainly tell you
that the issue of reliance is not an issue which is limited to com-
mercial cases.
Senator SPECTER. There was another very interesting case cap-
tioned State v. Meister, where again the facts are not of overwhelm-
ing importance for this proceeding, but it was a petition to annul a
record, and the Supreme Court of New Hampshire reversed a lower
court, saying that the court had not taken into account all of the
factors of rehabilitation.
It was an especially interesting case, because you had written an
opinion, as a Superior Court judge, and even though you had been
on record as having taken a position which was inconsistent with
the court's ruling, you went along with the ruling of the Supreme
Court in this Meister case. You said at the conclusion of the case:
"The consequences of what I believe was an unsound conclusion in
that case, are not serious enough to outweigh the value of stare de-
cisis."
So, here articulate a view that it is an unsound conclusion, but
follow the precedent, even though it was at variance with what you
decided before.
Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
Senator SPECTER. What principles of following precedent and
stare decisis were involved there which you felt that warranted to
uphold the prior case, even though you disagreed with the princi-
ples, had you had a chance to look at it from a fresh position?
Judge SOUTER. Well, of course, the most prominent feature of
that case was that it was a statutory construction case and I be-
lieved that if, in fact, the legislature had disagreed with the statu-
tory construction that the court placed on it, as erroneous as I
thought it was--of course, any judge who ever gets overruled is
                                               325

likely to think that the case that overrules him is erroneous, but I
really thought it was in that case--I believe that if the legislature
had any disagreement with the court's construction, it would have
amended the statute. It had not done so.

  I also believed, as I said there, that the consequences of the erro-
neous ruling were not of cosmic significance, so that it was perhaps
an easy case in which to follow stare decisis.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, the research which I have seen
says that there has never been a reversal, an overruling of a Su-
preme Court decision, where an earlier Supreme Court decision
had established a fundamental right. My question to you do you
know of any occasion where the Supreme Court of the United
States has overruled a prior Supreme Court decision which had es-
tablished what was categorized as a fundamental right?

  Judge SOUTER. I do not. I have never done the research, but I do
not.

  Senator SPECTER. The issue of supremacy of the Federal Govern-
ment has come up in a couple of contexts, and I believe that there
was some earlier testimony about States having different rules on
the abortion issue. Senator Leahy asked you a question about, in
the wiretap case, whether there was an obligation on the part of
the State of New Hampshire to follow the Federal rule, and you
said no, there was not, there could be a more restrictive rule,
which the New Hampshire Supreme Court would uphold the New
Hampshire Constitution on, than a Federal rule.

  Is it not similarly true, if a State, say, illustratively, California,
which has upheld the right of abortion and has passed a special
right of privacy in a constitutional provision could maintain those
rights of privacy and right to an abortion, notwithstanding any
contrary rule which might be established by the Supreme Court of
the United States?

  Judge SOUTER. SO far as the issue raised in Roe v. Wade is con-
cerned, the answer to that is correct. Whether there is any basis
that could be raised in different litigation, a different claim, based
on the rights of the fetus, rather than on the rights of the mother,
that, of course, is a totally undecided issue.

  Senator SPECTER. Yes, but a State could have a rule which gives
greater rights under that State constitution and State law, as, for
example, California or any other State, than is required by the Su-
preme Court of the United States of general applicability?

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, if we assume that the subject matter of the
rights are the same in each case, whichever gives the greater pro-
tection is the one that will prevail.

  Senator SPECTOR. Would a variation among the various States be
a factor for consideration in Roe v. Wade, if you would are to com-
ment on that?

  Judge SOUTER. I would prefer not to comment on it, sir.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, there was a reference which you
made earlier to the decision, your dissent in Smith v. Coat--no, it
is a concurring opinion in Smith v. Coat
  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. Where you took up the issue that a
physician did not have an obligation, under the wrongful life or
wrongful birth cases, without getting into the details there, so long
                                                326

as there was a timely referral, and I believe that you had com-
mented that you felt that was an aspect of the case which was in-
volved in what had been raised and had to be decided.

  The majority opinion said this: "We do not reach the issue raised
in the special concurrence of Judge Souter, because it had not been
raised, briefed or argued in the record before us."

  There have been a number of cases in the New Hampshire court
where, in accordance with the general rule that an issue may be
considered and decided by the court, only if it has been appropri-
ately raised, and I would ask for your construction as to why, in
the Smith v. Coat case, you took up the issue and decided it, in
light of what the majority in the court said, that it was not proper-
ly before the court.

  Judge SOUTER. The reason I took the position that I did was that
I felt the way the majority opinion had been written, that it was
inevitable that this question was raised, and my position was to
note that, in fact, the possibility that I pointed out was indeed not
foreclosed by the court's decision.

  It seemed to me that if we said absolutely nothing on the subject,
we had, as a court, raised a moral dilemma and that it was a moral
dilemma that was inherent in the effect of our decision and that
we should at least point out that there was nothing in our decision
which foreclosed the particular course of action that I mentioned in
my concurrence as a means of responding to that moral dilemma.

  So, I guess the answer boils down to this: It is not that it was an
issue that was expressly raised, but it was an issue which seemed
to me inherent in the way the court had decided the case and we
ought at least to say something about it.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, as you put it, even if it is inevita-
ble that an issue is to come before the court, is it not the custom-
ary judicial form to await the arrival of that issue before the court,
before deciding it?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, there is really an--I will not say an alterna-
tive, there is a complimentary principle that we frequently point
out, issues which we are reserving or not deciding, for the very
reason that we do not want our decisions to be read too broadly
and we do not want them to mislead, and I think that is what I
was doing in my concurrence there.

  Senator SPECTER. There has been a series of very important cases
narrowly decided, most recently Metro Broadcasting v. Federal
Communications Commission, where the Supreme Court of the
United States, in a 5-to-4 decision, decided that a minority interest
was a factor in the decision, in order to have diversification of pro-
gramming. The case is an important one, because there has been a
pitched argument as to whether race ever should be a factor to be
decided, contrasted with the generalization that the Constitution is
color blind and that race ought not to be a factor.

  The Metro Broadcasting case decided this year, 5 to 4, looks in
the other direction from a case decided last year, City of Richmond
v. Croson, where a 30-percent set-aside was stricken, as an uncon-
stitutional rule, where the city of Richmond had said that 30 per-
cent of the jobs would be available for minorities.

  Going back to an earlier case, and perhaps a leader in the field,
the Regents of University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme
                                              327

Court, speaking through Justice Powell, had stricken a separate ad-
missions policy for minorities, but had said that it is appropriate
that race may be one of the factors to be considered.

  My question for you is, as a generalization, do you believe that it
is appropriate in some circumstances that race is a factor to be con-
sidered by the court, in deciding this category of cases?

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think it is inevitable, to this extent: What
we are dealing, as you know, in the Metro--let us take the contrast
between Metro and Croson--we are dealing there with a contrast
between the treatment to be given the congressional power, wheth-
er it be under section 5 of the 14th amendment or under its article
I power in the case of Metro, and in Croson the court was dealing
with the authority of a lower unit of government, in that case a
city council, to take rate into consideration.

   The proposition which Metro stands for is that the congressional
power to engage in this kind of limited remedial action, which does
indeed take some account of race, is to be judged under the middle-
tier standard of scrutiny, whereas, the power of a lesser unit of
government, State, local, county, is to be judged under the higher
standard of strict scrutiny.

  Therefore Metro is one step in what I assume will be a long line
of cases that is going to result in the definition of the scope of con-
gressional power over remedial and race conscious with--of remedi-
al legislation with race conscious references.

  Bakke of course was a case which struck down the use by the
State of California of a strict quota but recognized, at least through
Justice Powell's swing opinion, recognized the possibility of taking
race into account solely for the purposes of creating diversity.

   So, I think for present purposes the most instructive contrast
right now is the Metro v. Croson contrast.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that is an illustrative distinction
that, where you have a quota system, that is not permissible. But
there are some circumstances, as you articulate your answer, as a
matter of general principle obviously depending upon what the
facts are in a case to come before the court, where it would be ap-
propriate to consider race as one of many factors in coming to a
decision.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes, sir.
  Senator SPECTER. When I had asked you about the war powers
resolution on Friday, I asked you to consider that question and
would like to renew that discussion at this point. The question
which I had asked, as I am sure you will recall, was whether you
thought it was unconstitutional or illegal for the Korean war to be
pursued in the absence of a congressional declaration of war. And I
asked that in the context of getting some idea as to your views of
the relative authority of the Congress under its sole prerogative to
declare war, contrasted with the President's power as the Com-
mander in Chief.
  And of course, this is not an academic subject, because in the
events of the day perhaps the most important world event of the
day involves what is happening in the Middle East, what is hap-
pening in Saudi Arabia. And we all know that the President has
ordered U.S. military forces into that area.
                                                328

  There are some complicated questions under the war powers res-
olution which requires notification to Congress, and the President
has given some notice to Congress. But as the President has acted
on so many events in the past, has done so without recognizing the
constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution. That is an issue
which is very difficult to get a Supreme Court decision on because
of the issue of case and controversy and the issue of standing. We
talked about the fact that in one of the cases, even though 110 Con-
gressmen had brought a case into the U.S. District Court here in
Washington, DC, the court had said that there was no standing.

  In asking you a question not related to the War Powers Resolu-
tion and not related to Vietnam because of the Gulf of Tonkin Res-
olution, which might arguably be construed to give congressional
authorization like a declaration of war, but in going back histori-
cally 40 years to June 25 of 1950, the day the Korean war started,
it seems to me that that is a fair question in an historical context,
test your own thinking on the judicial philosophy behind those two
important constitutional provisions.

  So I renew the question.
  Judge SOUTER. Senator, I have thought about it. I will be candid
to say that I did not try to do special research on it, because I did
not think that was the point of your question. I am going to give
you an answer. I have thought of this carefully, and I am going to
give you an answer which is different from any other answer that I
have given here; but it is the only honest one I can give you: I do
not know. I could go on at great length about where I reach the
point of not knowing, but the truth is I do not know. There is no
law on the subject that I am aware of that is helpful to me to work
from, and I do not know the answer.
  Senator SPECTER. That is a very good answer, probably one of the
best answers around and few people use. And it has taken a long
time in these proceedings in the twilight to have you give an "I
don't know" answer. So, I will accept that, because I do not think it
would do me much good not to.
  Returning to the subject of the supremacy of the judiciary, and
there has been one aspect which has not been covered; early on,
Senator Thurmond asked you about Marbury v. Madison. You said
that you did not think it was too brash in this day and age to
uphold Marbury v. Madison. That is, for those who do not know it,
the 1803 case where it was decided by the Supreme Court that the
Supreme Court had the last word on what the Constitution meant.
But there are some today who dispute that.
  One recent nominee coming before this committee would not
answer a question about whether he would uphold Marbury v.
Madison. When the question came to taking away the jurisdiction
of the court, you were not definitive; and I think that is a very,
very important question. I think that is a rockbed question as well.
And when we talked earlier about the taxation case, as much as
the taxation case may be disliked, if the Congress has the authority
by passing a statute to divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction,
even if, and I will get into the remedy versus the right issue, that
we have a constitutional question, it seems to me that Marbury v.
Madison does not have any real substance nor does the ultimate
                                         329

authority of the Supreme Court of the United States have any real
substance.

  I think it is very fundamental. We can pass a constitutional
amendment on the taxation case, and I think we may do that.
There is such a fundamental dichotomy between judicial authority
and legislative authority; but we can handle it. But I do ask you
whether you think the Congress has the authority to limit the ju-
risdiction of the Supreme Court.

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, the problem which your question raises
is what article III means when it speaks of not only regulation but
exception by Congress to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court. As you know, there have been two cases on the subject
really, and they do not answer our question for us. One seems to go
one way, and one seems to go the other way.

  The most that I can say, and perhaps this is saying a lot, is that
we do not have to argue about the--we have been using the word
fundamental, and I will use it here--the fundamental importance
of Marbury v. Madison as establishing basically the structure of
the Government of the United States. And the consequences of as-
suming that the power to except from the jurisdiction is a power
which Congress in effect can exercise in any way it sees fit is basi-
cally to deny the possibility of national unity in constitutional in-
terpretation.

  I do not--I can only say this, that I do not at this point under-
stand how such a result could be justified.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, that leans in the right direction,
but it does not really foreclose it. I pressed Chief Justice Rehnquist
hard on this issue, which I infer you know about because of the
care of your preparation, and he would answer the question about
the lack of congressional authority to take away the jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court on first amendment matters. He would not go
beyond the fourth amendment or the fifth amendment, inexplica-
bly to me, but I would ask you, as my final question on the subject,
would you at least go as far as Chief Justice Rehnquist did in his
confirmation hearing, to say that Congress does not have the au-
thority to take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on first
amendment issues?

  Judge SOUTER. I do not think I can put it that way, because I do
not know what distinction I would then draw in refusing to go
down the rest of the amendments.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, may you will not draw a distinction.
  Judge SOUTER. But, no, I think I have gone as far as I can go on
an issue which is always theoretically lurking and is perhaps lurk-
ing with more than theory at times, when Supreme Court decisions
are subject to vigorous challenge. But the significance of the issue
is one which I hope you will leave these hearings realizing that I
do not underestimate.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will not pursue that one any further
either.
  Let me come back to my final area of questioning, which is really
the big question. I would have started with this one on my round,
but I did not because it would have consumed the entire round.
Senator Biden is going to come back to this question. That is really
the central question in this entire hearing, and that is your view
                                                330

on how you decide constitutional questions. And I believe that
there is a fair amount more which needs to be considered here.

  The trouble that I have with your approach so far, Judge Souter,
is that you start from a position of interpretivism, which means in-
terpreting the Constitution. Then on the issue of original intent
you move away from that to original meaning. But on original
meaning you then have an interpretation which is at variance with
what the drafters said. The issue of capital punishment has arisen,
and I think it would be accurate to say, or perhaps I should ask
you the question: Do you think it would be a permissible interpre-
tation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and un-
usual punishment to say that the provision precludes the death
penalty?

  Judge SOUTER. I do not think that as a per se kind of rule we can
make that assumption, simply because of the recognition within
the document itself that capital punishment exists and a recogni-
tion which implies the assumption that the drafters accepted it as
legitimate.

  Senator SPECTER. Yes, capital punishment was in effect at the
time that the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and un-
usual punishment was drafted.

  Now, we have gotten extensively into the reapportionment cases.
The difficulty that I have with the reapportionment case is that,
even though you take a principle which you say is different in the
sixties, when Baker v. Carr was decided, and when the Sims case
was decided, that it is at variance with what the intent was at the
time that it was drafted, or Brown v. Board of Education. There is
no question that the drafters of the equal protection clause of the
14th amendment were opposed to the idea of desegregated schools.
So that, while you may say that the drafters articulated a principle
which has a different application in 1954, when the Brown v. Board
case was decided, contrasted with Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, and
different from the time the 14th amendment was adopted, can you
say fairly that under original intent, which you translate to origi-
nal meaning, and to a principle, that you can fairly decide the case
under that philosophical approach when it is directly at variance
or inconsistent with the original intent or original meaning of the
drafters?

  Judge SOUTER. The answer is yes, for this reason. And I think
this reason indicates the point at which you and I have sometimes
parted company in the discussion of the consistency of my views.
When you are speaking of original intent, as I understand it, and
as I understand what you have just said, you are referring to origi-
nal intent in the sense of the specific intent of the drafters to deal
with specific problems and conversely their provable intent not to
deal with other specific problems by the application of that particu-
lar provision of the 14th amendment. And I do not believe that
that kind of specific intentionalism is a valid interpretative canon.

  I believe, that is why, as I have said, that is why I have used the
terms original meaning or understanding to get away from that
sense of specific intentionalism. And once that is done, then I think
I have a perfectly consistent position.
                                         331

  Senator SPECTER. My time is up, but if I may just ask one final
question, Mr. Chairman, it is this. I can understand your position
on original intent and your shift over to original meaning.

  Judge SOUTER. Excuse me. I just do not mean to shift. I mean, I
start with a sense of original meaning. It is not a retreat from
something.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, it would take quite a time to go through
the interpretivism school, but the interpretivism school really
begins with original intent. Now, there has been a dichotomy over
to original meaning, and that has been the traditional way that
there has been an explanation given for Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion, which you have come back to repeatedly.

  But the difficulty I see with your philosophical approach here is
that you can say they have established a principle of equal protec-
tion and it means more than they had specifically in mind, their
meaning or their words at that time; and you apply it more broad-
ly to different facts in a different era. But can you apply it in
direct contradiction to what the meaning was of the drafters if you
are really talking about original meaning and interpretivism?

  Judge SOUTER. Not if you have established a meaning which is
different or which establishes a different principle from the one
that you are applying. But I think once again the reason that there
is some perplexity in our exchange is that you say, as you did a
moment ago, Senator, you are accepting the view that the equal
protection guarantee means more--I think that was your phrase--
than it meant at the time it was adopted, than it was intended to
mean by the drafters. And what I am saying is not that it in some
sense means more. I am saying that its application was not re-
stricted and cannot be restricted to just those specific instances
that the drafters intended to deal with at the time they drafted it.

  I do not think the principle means more. It is simply that its ap-
plication is not restricted to the immediate problems that they had
in mind to deal with when they adopted that and when they draft-
ed it.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Souter, I can understand the philosophy
which says that the principle is applied differently at a later date
depending on different facts. But I cannot understand an applica-
tion of a principle of original meaning which is directly contradic-
tory to what the drafters had in mind. Those who drafted the equal
protection clause specifically said that they did not want to deseg-
regate the schools. They had desegregated schools in the District of
Columbia, desegregated schools across the country. The Senate Gal-
lery was desegregated. And I think the decision is correct, but
where it will lead at the end of perhaps another round or more
that your philosophical approach is much closer to Chief Justice
Hughes in the Blyesdale case, which was the first major Supreme
Court decision which said we are going to take up changing circum-
stances. And that as you have articulated a judicial philosophy, you
are really outside of interpretivism, which is fine with me, but it is
important to know where you are on a scale of values. When Sena-
tor Grassley questioned you at length and pressed you on a number
of occasions for one Warren Court decision that you disagreed with,
you did not find one.
                                             332

  The worst one was Miranda, which you said we have learned to
live with.

  Now, I am prepared to accept you, interpretivism or noninterpre-
tivism, but I think it is an important point to know where you
stand, because your testimony, in my opinion, puts you way outside
of the interpretivism school. Your decisions that I have read are
much closer to the interpretivism school. There is Richardson, in
which you find the liberty interest. But most of your cases are con-
sistent with interpretivism and a restrictive construction of the
Constitution, but that is not what I hear your testimony to mean.

  Judge SOUTER. Senator, it depresses me that you may think that
I am in this inconsistency. I think, in the narrowest compass, the
reason that you are sort of reading me out of interpretivism is that
you are making the assumption that the only brand of originalism,
if you will, that is a genuinely interpretist brand is the brand of
specific intent. And with respect, I think that is not, I think that is
not so.

  I think the brand of original meaning or original understanding
is in fact a valid interpretivist position. And the only point at
which that comes in in any way in conflict, if it is in conflict, with
what you describe as the intentions of the framers of the amend-
ment is at the point at which we say, when they drafted a provi-
sion which was broader than necessary to perform the specific
functions they had in mind, they really meant what they said and
we have a broader principle.

  Senator SPECTER. My time is past due, so I will yield at this
point. Perhaps Senator Biden will reopen the door, and perhaps we
can pursue it somewhat further.

  The CHAIRMAN. If I may say before I yield, I quite frankly
thought that the Judge answered my questions, that the spectrum
of interpretivism is very broad--it encompasses Black to Bork, to
Ely, to others who are out there. It is a broad spectrum.

  With that, let me yield now. Senator Simon is next, but I would
like to yield for a moment to the ranking member, Senator Thur-
mond, who has a couple of things he would like to say. And then I
will yield to the Senator from Illinois.

  Senator THURMOND. I did not take my last round.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, we are almost through the hearing today. I am
going to leave in a few minutes. I wanted to make a few remarks.
  First I want, as ranking member, I want to express my apprecia-
tion to all the members of this committee, Democrat and Republi-
can, for the courtesies they have shown to Judge Souter. I think
they have all been courteous and respectful, and we deeply appreci-
ate that.
  I especially wish to commend Chairman Biden. I have worked
with Chairman Biden for a number of years now. When I was
chairman, he was ranking member; now he is chairman and I am
ranking member. We have always had a fine relationship. I have
found him to be courteous and helpful, considerate. I just want to
express my appreciation to you for the way in which you have han-
dled this hearing.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
                                               333

  Senator THURMOND. We deeply appreciate it.
  ^ow, Judge Souter, I want to commend you for your demeanor
in this hearing. You have appeared humble, and you have ap-
peared courteous and, I think, tried to explain the answers to any
questions that were propounded to you.
  You have brought out the fact that you will listen on the Su-
preme Court. I do not know whether I have ever heard a Supreme
Court Justice say that before, but I like that expression: I will
listen. You will listen. And that is important. People cannot listen
when they are talking. They learn by listening.
  The very fact that you will be a good listener, I think, is a very
fine symbol here of what you stand for.
  Your experience in public life and in the Attorney General's
office and on the State courts of New Hampshire, the trial court
and the appellate court and then on the Federal circuit have cer-
tainly served you well and will be very helpful to you, I am sure,
here.
  I have been impressed, too, with your common sense. After all, I
think that probably counts as much or more than anything else. A
man can have all the education in the world, he can have all the
experience; but it is common sense that counts. And I think be-
cause of your common sense you will make a fine Justice on the
Supreme Court.
  Now, we all were pleased with the outstanding rating that the
ABA gave. They are going to testify after a while, but I just want
to say this. One sentence here said: Judge Souter is highly compe-
tent and possesses a scholarly, analytical and writing skills neces-
sary to serve successfully on the Supreme Court of the United
States. And they conclude by saying: Based upon all the informa-
tion available to it, this committee concludes that Judge Souter is
entitled to its highest rating for a nominee to the Supreme Court of
the United States.
  They have not given all the judges the highest rating. Again, I
compliment you. I am sure they have cited you up right.
  I want to say further that the points I mention that I felt were
important for a Supreme Court Justice were--and the ABA, I be-
lieve, bases these three: integrity, professional competency, and ju-
dicial temperament. In addition I added to that: courage, compas-
sion, and understanding of the majesty of our system of govern-
ment. And I feel that you possess all those qualities.
  I have been very pleased with your testimony. I am just not ex-
actly sure about this vacuum you talked about. I am of the opinion
that, if there is a vacuum, it ought to be filled by the proper agency
of the Government. If it is a legislative function, a legislative func-
tion; if it is an executive function, an executive function. I do not
think there has to be any vacuum necessarily. I may disagree with
you a little on that. But since you are right on everything else, it
seems to me I can overlook that.
  Judicial usurpation, sometimes when decisions are handed down,
people feel the judges have taken over where they should not have
done so. In other words, the judges should not usurp the authority
of the Congress or the executive branch. Now, a few years ago Mr.
Truman seized the steel mills, and the Court struck it down and
                                              334

said you cannot take private property without due process of law.
Well, he usurped there but the Court corrected him.

  The Congress may usurp at times; the Court can correct it. But it
is very difficult for anybody or any agency to correct the Supreme
Court. I would just urge you to give it as much consideration as
you can when it comes to this matter of judicial usurpation. I think
that is extremely important. Some of us may feel, some judges may
feel we need certain social reforms. And if the Congress does not
make them, well then, we as judges will do it. I do not think that is
right.

  I think the people, if they are needed that bad, the people will
bring pressure on the Congress to do it, that that is the Congress'
duty. In other words, I think the three branches ought to stay in
their respective spheres as provided under the Constitution, no
matter how worthy the goals are. And a lot of the goals are
worthy.

  I tell my people back home, why did you not do so and so? I said,
that is not a Federal responsibility; that is a State responsibility.
Education is not mentioned in the Constitution. That is mainly a
State responsibility.

  I think we should make progress, but make it at the level of gov-
ernment as provided in the Constitution. And in that way we do
not usurp.

  This was a government established of limited powers. If any
agency does not have the power it should have, executive, legisla-
tive, or judicial, we can amend the Constitution. We have amended
it 26 different times. It can be amended again. But I do not think
the judges ought to fill in if they feel there is a vacuum.

  Now I want to mention this on habeas corpus. We had a man
who came down from another State and killed a friend of mine,
Turner, who worked at the Navy yard in Charleston, a coin collec-
tor. He came down and robbed him and, robbing him, he killed
him. He killed three other people, four people, and thought he
killed a fifth one, a woman. I am sure you remember that woman
who came with a disfigured face; she is ruined for life. That case
went to the Supreme Court four different times over 10 or 12 years.
That is inexcusable. People lose respect for the law when such as
that happens.

  That is the reason we passed a crime bill this year to limit the
Federal jurisdiction to 1 year. The Senator from Pennsylvania had
a big part in that. He worked with me very closely on that habeas
corpus provision.

  Senator Hatch says in his State one case went for 16 years. In
other words, I think we have got to respect as much as we can the
rights of the States. I am sure that people in the States are just as
interested in protecting and providing for law and order as the Su-
preme Court is. As much as we can, I think we ought to expedite
the litigation, especially the criminal litigation.

  We have got to remember the victims as weli as the criminals.
Too much sympathy, I think, sometimes goes to a criminal.

  Now, those are just a few points I want to make to you. Again I
want to say that I think you have done a fine job here. You have
handled yourself well. I think you will make an excellent Supreme
Court judge, and I wish you well.

  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, Senator.
  May I just say before you leave that I am very proud to have
been a part of a process in which you participated.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Judge, as you obviously are aware of, you just heard from one of
the few men who could say, a few years ago when Truman took the
steel mills, and was here when that happened.
  And also, you are giving us all some mind reassurance, as my
more conservative friends begin to doubt how intrusive you may
be, many of us begin to think that, wow, maybe we have got the
right nominee.
  I am going to yield now to Senator Simon and stop trying to
make humor at this time of the night.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you
also, Mr. Chairman, for your patience with all of us. You have con-
ducted things very, very well.
  Judge Souter, you have also been patient. This is the longest
birthday party you have ever had or probably ever will have.
  I have only one question, and you will be pleased that I have
only one question. I wish that your life on the Court were along the
line that my colleague and friend, Senator Hatch, said; that all you
have to do is look and see what Congress intended and what the
constitutional principles are and then you follow those. And that,
you agree, and we all agree, should happen. But unfortunately
there are also times when things are gray. That is why we have 5-
to-4 decisions by the Court.
  You are being called upon to be, in a very special way, a champi-
on for freedom. What I want on that Court, what I want in that
Supreme Court Justice is someone who, when it is gray and you
are not real sure how to go, will err on the side of freedom. It is
always easy to give up freedom. It is much more difficult to protect
it.
  I guess my question, my final question is, Do we have a nominee
who is going to err on the side of freedom?
  Judge SOUTER. I would like to rephrase my statement of objective
just slightly. I think you will appreciate it. I wish I knew whom I
am quoting; I should know but I do not. But I would like to say
that
  The CHAIRMAN. GO ahead and guess.
  Senator HEFLIN. NO; be judicial.
  The CHAIRMAN. Believe me, it is safer.
  Judge SOUTER. If there is a direction to err in, it is the direction
that is summed up in the phrase that looks to our law for what
was described as the just restraints that make people free. That is
the direction that I should like to err in. That is what I shall seek.
  Senator SIMON. I thank you.
  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me now ask, I have a few closing questions,
but before I do, I want to find out if anybody else in the panel has
anything they would like to say. Senator Specter would like to
make a brief concluding statement. Would anybody else have any-
thing to say of the witness prior to--we need not have eulogies; I
am not encouraging them. Does anybody have any questions that
                                               336

they have remaining before I conclude with three questions that I
have?

  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Souter, at the conclusion of my last round just a few mo-
ments ago, I had expressed some concern on where you fit in and
how you would interpret the Constitution. I have devoted a fair
amount of the time allotted to me to that subject. It is now 7:21,
and I think that I will forgo any further questioning, to the chair-
man, we have other witnesses yet to go this evening, people who
have traveled and want to finish up.
  I would just make a very brief concluding statement. The subject
of where you are on judicial philosophy is a very, very important
subject because you very correctly have declined to answer ques-
tions about future cases which are likely to come before the Court
because of the process that you ought to have a specific case, hear
the argument, confer, et cetera, before you make your decision. So
it is important, and we have gone into this issue at some substan-
tial length to try to make a determination as to how you would ap-
proach the problems. After reading your opinions, I had a view
that you were going to be very restrictive in your application of
constitutional law.
  As I have listened to you testify, I see expansive responses in
terms of not only the vacuum but the scope of the liberty clause
and the Court on certain political matters. We got into the tax
case. It has been my conclusion after hearing your testimony that
you are a fair distance from original meaning, for reasons which I
have said before. But I do not think that it would serve any useful
purpose at this time to protract the matter. I will, therefore, con-
clude within 2 minutes from starting with my congratulations to
you, Judge Souter, on a really outstanding, not performance, out-
standing responses.
  You are obviously a thorough jurist. You come really well pre-
pared. You have been, I think, as forthcoming as you could be, al-
though I would have preferred a few more specific answers to a few
more specific cases, a few more specific questions that I think in-
volve matters not likely to come before your Court, but I--or the
Court that you may be confirmed to, without prejudging it.
  I compliment you for what you have done here. I say finally, my
thanks and congratulations to the chairman for his usual outstand-
ing job.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  By the way, the chairman committed a faux pas this morning,
among many I have committed. One was that, while congratulating
you on your birthday, I failed to point out that it is also Senator
Grassley's birthday. So I would say happy birthday to you, Senator.
I apologize for
  Senator GRASSLEY. Can I suggest that it is also the birthday of
our U.S. Constitution?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you can.

  Senator GRASSLEY. The signing of it, that is.
  The CHAIRMAN. I will celebrate all three this evening.
  Happy birthday, Senator.
                                               337

  Let me conclude, as I said, with three questions; and this will be
the end.

  Judge, when deciding--and I want to go back to methodology for
a minute; slightly different than your overall judicial philosophy.
When deciding if there is a fundamental unenumerated right, ap-
plying your methodology, you say, in quote: There should be a
quest not for evidence, which is a matter of definition or a matter
of absolute necessity, has either got to be of narrow compass or of
general compass. Rather, it has got to be a quest for reliable evi-
dence, and there may be reliable evidence of great generality. End
of quote.

  That was in response to my question yesterday about footnote six
in the Michael H. case.

  Judge SOUTER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I have two key questions. How old does this
tradition that you are seeking to determine whether or not it has
been established have to be before it is considered a tradition
worthy of protecting under the Constitution?
  And just so this is not viewed by some as some crazy idea, what
happens when there is a mixed tradition of a practice having been
lawful for some time and then unlawful at a later time in that con-
tinuum? Or unlawful and then lawful? How far back do you go to
look? And how far forward is it relevant in establishing the tradi-
tion?
  I am not looking for an exact number of years. But do you look
at the whole continuum? Give me a sense of what you look at.
  Judge SOUTER. Well, I think it is fair to say that you look at the
whole continuum for whatever the evidence may be worth. The
whole continuum may tell you something about what you can ex-
trapolate from it as a principle which either is or is not continuous
through our history.
  I do not think there is a point at which you can say, well, I draw
the line and I will consider no evidence after this point or no evi-
dence before this point. But the point is, at whatever historical
period the evidence may come into existence, what we are really
looking for is a principle of liberty which can reasonably be said to
have been assumed in the Constitution.
  The CHAIRMAN. The reason I ask the question is we are in the
midst of such phenomenal technological change. In this country we
are considering items that will be on your agenda in the year 2020,
if confirmed, God willing, you are living out the expected, your life
expectancy, that relate to everything from genetic engineering to
potentially cloning, to surrogate parenthood, all of which by the
time you are making decisions in the year 2020 may be very much
established traditions. There may be 30 years of it being an accept-
ed and protected practice in the 50 States and territories for surro-
gate parenthood, something that, although you may find a princi-
ple to be protected, clearly was not something that anyone consid-
ered not only at the birth of our Constitution but in 1970, let alone
1950. And that is why I asked the question.
  So, it will, there could be 30 years of an established practice that
could make the tradition, assuming there were a principle found
within that tradition, make that a sufficient amount of time to find
a protection of such an asserted liberty right. Is that correct?
                                         338

  Judge SOUTER. Well, I guess my only cavil is, I do not, I do not
think it is, it is probably right to phrase it by saying that is a suffi-
cient amount of time. That is certainly indicative of the acceptance
of a principle during that time, and that is good evidence. The
question is, is there any other evidence? Is there evidence to the
contrary? Is the evidence of whatever principle may be behind the
30 year or the 50 year or whatever year tradition, a sufficiently re-
liable indication of an enduring principle of liberty.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, were there more time, I would like to
pursue that.

  Let me conclude by suggesting, Judge, that during the several
days of your testimony--and I, too, have been impressed with your
knowledge. I have been impressed with your ability to articulate
your position. I have been impressed with the ease with which you
were able to make clear the purpose behind, the rationale behind a
number of decisions, including even referring to the sense within
those opinions that most would spend time in a law library having
to look up. And you have done it off the top of your head. I have
been truly impressed.

  I must also admit I have not changed my mind, but I have,
during the period of your testimony, gone from leaning against
voting for you, to leaning for voting for you, to leaning against
voting for you. And I was being a bit facetious a moment ago when
I suggested that the fact that you have those who view them-
selves--and there is no such animal--as being literalist, those who
look only to the text, and if they do not find it there--there are
some, but not many who think they are, because they find it very
difficult to live with the results that would have been wrought and
that methodology been employed--the more you have raised ques-
tions in their mind, I acknowledge, the more you settled mine.

  I appreciate your willingness to go into the detail you have in
terms of your methodology.

  I am still, as you know, disappointed that you were willing to go
into a good deal of greater detail on matters that related to issues
other than procreation than you were with regard to procreation,
even though in my view they are unsettled areas as well as the
whole question of, that is, the most in dispute.

  But for me, the judgment that I am going to have to make is
whether or not after rereading your testimony, and this is one of
those few cases where I can assure you I will, not all of it, but the
parts that relate to the areas of greatest concern to me; whether or
not I am convinced that you are a man of open mind with the judi-
cial philosophy, methodology and principled way of approaching
how to make these judgments that is consistent with, to para-
phrase the Senator from Pennsylvania, an expansive reading of the
Constitution that would have allowed you to reach the decisions
that I think the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans believe were
appropriate for the court to reach.

  And I realize that is not your problem; that is mine. I have to
make that judgment, and I obviously will. But again, I think it has
been a tour de force on your part. I have been impressed and not
merely with your recall but also with your willingness as the day
has gone on, to, in my view, be more open and expansive in your
response relative to your philosophy and to your methodology.
                                         339

  So I thank you very, very much. I know of no reason at this junc-
ture why you would be asked to come back. But I will tell you,
since it is a practice of this committee, as you know, to invite wit-
nesses who wish to testify for and against your nomination, and
that is historically the way in which it functions, that if anyone,
whether they are testifying for you or against you, during the
period of the next several days makes assertions, statements or
characterizations relative to your philosophy or anything else that
you feel you would like to clarify, that I guarantee you that the
witness stand is yours again if you wish to take it. And it is not our
intention and is not likely that we would ask you to resume any
questioning prior to us making a judgment to vote for or against
you in the committee.

  I would invite you, Judge, if you have any closing comment you
wish to make, we would be delighted to hear it.

  Judge SOUTER. I promise you, Mr. Chairman, I really will be
brief in what I have to say. There are two things that I do want to
say.

  The first I will address to you, but I will address to you as the
chairman of this entire committee. It is one of those things that
goes without saying, it would go without saying, but it must be
said. And that is you have treated me with such consummate fair-
ness, and the whole committee has, that in whatever court I may
sit I hope I will always be able to do as well when I am presiding.

  The second thing is to thank you and the committee for some-
thing broader than that even. That is, I realize there are many al-
ternatives that you may have or some alternatives that you may
have in considering a nomination like this. What I am most grate-
ful for is that you have not only, and you are now not only consid-
ering my nomination, but you have made me a part of that great
process. I am very proud to have been here. I am very grateful to
you for having me, every one of you. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Judge.
  As they say, you will be hearing from us shortly. Thank you
very, very much.
  Judge SOUTER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW we will recess for 1 minute here.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come back to order.
  One of my colleagues asked the question, is it possible, under the
committee rules, to vote for Souter and against Rudman, and the
answer is we will take that under advisement. I am not sure.
[Laughter.]
  I want to thank Senator Rudman, by the way, for spending as
much time as he has here and for being available to answer my
questions, as we have tried to work out the mechanics of this hear-
ing. I thank him very much.
  Now, our panel who has been waiting here a long, long, long
time, as a matter of fact, I suspect the entire day, is the American
Bar Association panel: Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr., is the chairperson of
the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary; and Alice E.
Richmond is the first circuit representative of the Standing Com-
mittee on the Federal Judiciary, and Jorge Rangel is the fifth cir-
cuit representative of the Standing Committee on the Federal Judi-
                                             340

ciary--it would be a heck of a thing to leave you off at this point. I
apologize.

  Now I will yield to Senator Kennedy for a moment.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to join in welcoming the panel and pay a special welcome
to Alice Richmond, who has been representing the first circuit and
who has had a very distinguished career in her own right, and I
want to add my welcome to her.
  I want all of our panel to give,our best wishes to the president of
the American Bar Association, Jack Curtain, who is a resident of
Massachusetts, has been a long-time friend, and just got out of the
hospital today from successful surgery, and I think all of us look
forward to his early return to his practice of law and also leader-
ship in the ABA, and I wish you would extend to him my very
warm regards and wishes, and extend my appreciation to the time
that you spent, Ms. Richmond.
  Thank you.
  Ms. RICHMOND. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me say to the entire panel, I appreciate your
waiting until this hour, and the reason why I asked you to is I con-
sider the testimony of the ABA to be very, very important. I know
there is some controversy and has been over the last several years,
but I for one and, as chairperson of this committee, have in fact
always thought and continue to think that your participation in
this process is essential and that is why you are, to your chagrin, I
suspect, awarded what we consider to be the position of honor as
the first public witness. You probably at this hour wish that maybe
you had not been awarded that position.
  With that, let me invite you, Mr. Lancaster, to make any com-
ment you would like, any opening statement on behalf of the com-
mittee, and then we will ask you some questions, if we may, or if
your colleagues would like to make a statement, that is fine.

PANEL CONSISTING OF RALPH I. LANCASTER, JR., CHAIRPERSON,

  CAN BAR ASSOCIATION; ALICE E. RICHMOND, FIRST CIRCUIT

                  STATEMENT OF RALPH I. LANCASTER

  Mr. LANCASTER. Thank you, Senator. Our introductory remarks
will be very brief.

  Mr. Chairman, as you indicated, I am Ralph Lancaster. I practice
law in Portland, ME, and I have the privilege of chairing the
ABA's Standing Committee on the Judiciary, and as you also indi-
cated, with me tonight are Alice Richmond, who practices law in
Boston, MA, and is the first circuit representative on the commit-
tee, and Jorge Rangel, of Corpus Christi, TX, who is the fifth cir-
cuit representative on the committee.
                                      341
  We appear to present the views of the committee on the nomina-
tion of the Honorable David H. Souter, to be an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States.
  At the request of the Attorney General, our committee evaluated
the professional competence, the judicial temperament and integri-
ty of Judge Souter. Our work included discussions with Federal
and State judges, practicing lawyers and law school deans and pro-
fessors and faculty members, some of whom are specialists in con-
stitutional law and experts on the Supreme Court practice.
  The committee reviewed many of Judge Souter's opinions and, in
addition, as our report reflects, Judge Souter's New Hampshire Su-
preme Court opinions were reviewed by three reading committees,
one chaired by Rex Lee, the former Solicitor General of the United
States, who now is the president of Brigham Young, one chaired by
Ronald Allen, of Northwestern University, who is a professor
there, and one chaired by Dean Paul Brest, of Stanford.
  In addition, the three members who appear here before you to-
night interviewed Judge Souter and, based upon our evaluation,
the committee has reported to the Attorney General and to this
committee that it is unanimously of the opinion that Judge Souter
is entitled to the committee's highest evaluation for a nominee to
the Supreme Court of the United States, well qualified.
  I have filed with this committee a letter describing the results of
our investigation and shall not repeat those results in detail here,
but I do request that that letter be included in the record of these
proceedings.
  The CHAIRMAN. It will be placed in the record.

appeared before him either at the Superior Court or Supreme Court
level.

       Judge Souter was interviewed by three members of this Committee.

       At the request of this Committee, all of Judge Souter's more
than 200 New Hampshire Supreme Court opinions were reviewed by:

       1. A Reading Committee chaired by Rex E. Lee, former Solicitor
General of the United States and presently President of Brigham
Young University;

       2. A Reading Committee chaired by Professor Ronald Allen of the
Northwestern School of Law in Chicago; and

       3. A Reading Committee chaired by Dean Paul Brest of the
Stanford Law School.*

       The results of the reviews by those three Reading Committees
were independently analyzed and evaluated by each member of the
Committee. In addition, each member of the Committee independently
read and analyzed selected New Hampshire Supreme Court opinions
authored by Judge Souter. All of Judge Souter's opinions as
Attorney General and many of his Superior Court opinions were also
reviewed, analyzed and evaluated.

       This Committee also had the benefit of a very thorough and most
recent investigation of Judge Souter for appointment to the First
Circuit Court of Appeals. While the same factors considered with
respect to the lower federal courts are relevant to an appointment
to the United States Supreme Court, this Committee's Supreme Court
investigations are based upon the premise that the Supreme Court
requires a person with exceptional professional qualifications. For
that reason, a Supreme Court investigation by this Committee, while
directed to the same professional qualifications of integrity,
professional competence and judicial temperament, requires a new and
expanded investigation. In this instance, because of the recency of
our investigation for Judge Souter's appointment to the First
Circuit Court of Appeals, much of the preliminary work had already
be?" TCirplifhai. E":ldm.<7 upon +"h?t b^se, each mpmbpr of the
Committee conducted an investigation within his or her own circuit
which, as noted above, included calls to federal and state judges,
practicing lawyers, lav/ school professors and deans and those who
had known Judge Souter as a Rhodes Scholar, in law school, during
his tenure in the Office of the Attorney General of New Hampshire
and while on the Superior and Supreme Courts of New Hampshire, with
special emphasis on interviews of those who had appeared before him,
or served with him, during his 12-year tenure as a judge.

        * Members of these three Reading Committees who participated
are listed m Exhibit A to this letter.

EVALUATION

       Integrity

       Judge Souter's integrity, character and general reputation
appear to be of the highest order and without blemish.

       Judicial Temperament

       Judge Souter's judicial temperament appears to meet the high
standards of this Committee's definition.

       Comments such as "no biases, very fair," "very honorable and
fair," "dignified demeanor," and "very honest, decent, kind" were
made repeatedly throughout the interviews.

       A small number of those interviewed expressed concern about
Judge Souter's method of aggressively questioning appellate
lawyers. After exhaustive interviews, the Committee is satisfied
that Judge Souter is always very well prepared and that his
questioning is in fact searching but generally regarded as not
unpleasant. As one lawyer phrased it, Judge Souter:

        . . . is always prepared and has an incredible ability to
       cut through and ask terrifying questions and is fun to
       appear before because he always challenges your
       presentation.

       A very few of those interviewed questioned Judge Souter's
evenhandedness in his treatment of parties and issues. Concerns
that Judge Souter is "too deferential to the Legislature" or "biased
in favor of government action" or "brings his personal predilections
to his opinions" were thoroughly investigated by this Committee.
Each of these concerns was discussed with Judge Souter and examined
in detail by the Committee in light of all the other information we
had gathered. We concluded that Judge Souter's opinions are shaped
by his conception of the role of an appellate judge and not by any
lack of evenhandedness.

       profess loral Coppeter.ee

       Judge Souter's professional competence appears to meet the high
standards of the Committee.

                Professional Background. The Committee was favorably
impressed with Judge Souter's professional training and experience.
His undergraduate and law school education at Harvard, his selection
as a Rhodes Scholar, his experiences in the Office of the Attorney
General of New Hampshire, and his judicial service provide a solid
background for service on the Supreme Court of the United States.

                 Interviews. Those interviewed who had direct knowledge of
Judge Souter's professional work spoke in very positive terms about
                                      345

his intellectual capacity, writing and analytical ability, knowledge
of the law, industry, and diligence.

       Phrases such as "very scholarly," "a sharp mind," "absolutely
brilliant," "intellectually gifted," "very industrious," "a
significant intellect" were repeatedly used. No one questioned
Judge Souter's intellectual capacity, analytical ability, industry
or diligence.

                Writings. This Committee's independent evaluation of Judge
Souter's writing satisfied it that his opinions are on the whole
technically and persuasively crafted, fair and evenhanded and
generally do not go beyond points at issue. Based upon its
independent evaluation, this Committee satisfied itself that Judge
Souter has the ability to write lucidly and persuasively, to
harmonize a body of law and to give guidance to the trial courts for
future cases.

       As noted above, three Reading Committees were asked to review
Judge Souter's New Hampshire Supreme Court opinions and to furnish
to this Committee their opinions of Judge Souter's analytical
ability and writing skills in the context of his professional
competency. There was remarkable consistency among the three
Reading Committees in their independent evaluations of his
writings. They described his writing as well organized and
comprehensive and concluded that he is an exceedingly intelligent
and capable jurist. One commentator noted that he is an extremely
able state appellate court judge in the classic mold of a common law
jurist." Another noted that "there is . . . no question that he
possesses highly sophisticated legal skills that are not daunted by
the intricacies of complex cases."

       An occasional reviewer described Judge Souter's prose as
"relatively dry" or "somewhat discursive." This Committee concluded
that such stylistic criticisms did not substantially affect its
opinion as to his overall qualifications.

       A very few members of the Reading Committee questioned whether
Judge Souter's opinions reflect the capacity to deal ably with
complex constitutional patters, suggesting that matters before the
courts on which he sat generally did not involve such issues.
Others were satisfied that he does possess the intellectual and
analytical skills to deal with issues presented to the United States
Supreme Court.

        In the course of their responses to their charge, the Reading
Committees made numerous references to concurrences or dissents
authored by Judge Souter as examples of the quality of his work. It
was clear from their comments, and from the independent analyses of
Judge Souter's writing by this Committee, that the best examples of
Judge Souter's writing and intellectual abilities were found in his
dissents and concurrences. By way of example only, reference was
                                   346

made to his dissent in Keeton v. Hustler Magazine. Inc.. 549 A.2d

1187 (N.H. 1988) where Judge Souter engaged in a careful interests

analysis which was characterized as demonstrating ". . . a clear

ability to pierce traditional formulas in the course of forging

coherent law." Similarly, reference was made to his dissenting

opinion in State v. Koppel. 499 A.2d 977 (N.H. 1985) which

prefigured the analysis adopted by the majority when the United

States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of sobriety

checkpoints in Michigan State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. , 110

L.Ed.2d 412 (1990). It was also pointed out that in his concurrence

in Petition of Chapman. 509 A.2d 753 (N.H. 1986) Judge Souter

anticipated by four years the Supreme Court's decision in Keller v.

State Bar of California, 495 U.S.  , 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990)

(prohibiting use of mandatory Bar dues for certain lobbying

activities).

       Based upon its own independent evaluation of the opinions
authored by Judge Souter and the responses of the Reading
Committees, and based upon the results of the rest of its
investigation, including extensive interviews with Judge Souter,
this Committee is satisfied that whether one agrees or disagrees
with the court's holdings, the opinions are carefully crafted,
analytically sound and clearly professionally competent.

       It is the opinion of the Committee that Judge Souter is highly
competent and possesses the scholarly, analytical and writing skills
necessary to serve successfully on the Supreme Court of the United
States.

CONCLUSION

       Based upon all of the information available to it, this
Committee concluded that Judge Souter is entitled to its highest
rating for a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.

       Accordingly, this Committee unanimously found Judge Souter "Well
Qualified" for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.

       The Committee will review its report at the conclusion of the
hearings and notify vou if any circumstances have developed that
dictate modification of these views.

              Respectfully submitted,

  Mr. LANCASTER. With that, Mr. Chairman, I will simply say that
we are very pleased to have had the opportunity to appear here to-
night and we are very grateful to you, even though the hour is
late, for giving us the opportunity to appear here and not having to
return tomorrow.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me begin, if I may, by asking you, Mr. Lan-
caster or either of your colleagues, if they wish to answer: You
have testified in your statement that your committee used three
criteria to evaluate Judge Souter's nomination, his competence, his
integrity, and his judicial temperament.
  Did the committee, in any way, evaluate Judge Souter's constitu-
tional philosophy?
  Mr. LANCASTER. Only to the extent that it would in any way
impact on the three criteria which we investigated, professional
competence, judicial temperament, and integrity.
  The CHAIRMAN. Having listened to Judge Souter testify here for
several days, I have no doubt that he is a man of great integrity
and competence, and I have no doubt that he has a reasonable judi-
cial temperament. He has demonstrated that, in my view, over the
period of the questioning.
  To the extent that there are serious and debatable issues involv-
ing his nomination, I believe they involve Judge Souter's views on
his constitutional philosophy. Would you agree, then, that the
ABA's evaluation of Judge Souter does not and should not address
or relate to these concerns?
  Mr. LANCASTER. Clearly, I would agree that the ABA's investiga-
tion should not include any investigation into or consideration of
his ideology or his political philosophy. To the extent that his judi-
cial philosophy were to be shown to affect either his predilections
toward or his bias or his commitment to equal justice, I think they
are proper within the scope of our investigation.
  The CHAIRMAN. Running the risk of opening a pandora's box, if
Judge Souter had said to you his judicial philosophy dictates that
the vast majority of cases that have been decided relating to equal
justice were wrongly decided, beginning with Brown, and if he were
on the Court he would be compelled to seek to reopen those cases
and overrule them, would your committee still have, notwithstand-
ing he was a man of intelligence, competence and--what was the
other criteria that was used--competence, integrity, and judicial
temperament, would they still have supported him?
  Mr. LANCASTER. Judge Souter's responses to our interviews and if
his record showed that he had a closed mind and that he was ap-
proaching issues, not as an independent jurist, but as a man who,
either because of bias or because of personal judgments or personal
moral positions, was totally closed, would not listen to arguments
and would not bring his obviously superior intellect to a judgment
which would show that he was an independent jurist, yes, the
answer would be yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. If Judge Souter were to have volunteered to you
that which he did not and it is not his view, would have volun-
teered to you that the equal protection clause of the 14th amend-
ment does not apply to women, would you have been willing, sir--
well, I am going to ask all three of you that--to have voted to sup-
                                         349

port his nomination, notwithstanding fact that he is a man of com-
petence, integrity and judicial temperament? Ms. Richmond?

  Ms. RICHMOND. I would not.
  Mr. RANGEL. I would not, either.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I will not ask the chairman, because
occasionally the chairman has to do a lot of things, and since there
are two of the three people answered on the panel, I will not press
the chairman.
  Let me yield to my colleague from Iowa.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I am going to waive any questions
that might be asked, but I do have an observation, and I am sure,
Mr. Chairman, you would not be surprised if the observation I
make about the ABA is 180 degrees different from yours, but I
would like to raise that issue.

  I start by saying to you, Mr. Lancaster, that I appreciate your
efforts to try to restore the ABA committee to its legitimate and
very modest role, and I appreciate the time that you spent with me
in my office when you first took on the role as chairman.

  What I have to say is somewhat different than what the chair-
man had to say, when he introduced you as the ABA committee. I
mean no personal disrespect when I say that especially when it
comes to Supreme Court nominees, the ABA is at best an irrele-
vancy.

  This nominee, Mr. Souter, proves it better than anything I could
say. Everybody on this planet Earth recognizes that Judge Souter
is a very skilled lawyer. We all know he writes sound opinions and
we all know that he is a man of impeccable integrity. Not surpris-
ingly, that is your conclusion, as well.

  You say that you read all of his opinions and had outside experts
do the same. So did we. Our chairman even employed his own out-
side law professors as experts.

  You say you talked to people who know him and appeared before
him, and so did we. You said you had an extensive interview with
him. Well, I doubt that you have spent more than the 15 hours or
so that we as a committee have, asking him questions like we did.
And because you cannot do any more than we can, you cannot tell
us anything that we do not already know and have known for sev-
eral weeks.

   In fact, someone more cynical than I might suggest that the only
time the ABA has a meaningful role in Supreme Court nomina-
tions is when you smuggle illicit political considerations into the
evaluation. On the other hand, when the ABA sticks to objective
criteria, the result is just what we would expect. So, then, my ques-
tion: Why do we need the ABA?

  Now, perhaps you hope that your ratification of what we already
know about Judge Souter will rehabilitate the committee in its re-
lationship with the Attorney General, and I do not know if this
strategy is working. Maybe the Attorney General is simply easier
to please than some of us on this committee are.

  Mr. Chairman, I know that you have heard me say this before,
but it bears repeating, that I honestly think the time has come to
give the ABA a gold watch for their years of service and retire
them and let it go at that.
                                                350

   The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Senator. I would only ask who would
pay for the gold watch.

  Senator GRASSLEY. DO you want me to buy it? [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Senator. As he indicated, we do have
a very different point of view.
  Now my colleague from Alabama, Senator Heflin. Judge, do you
have any questions?
  Senator HEFLIN. I wanted to tell you that I think you have done
a good job. I think over the years the ABA has done an outstanding
job and has been of great assistance to the committee. We do not
always agree. I know that I differed on a couple at one time. Nev-
ertheless, I think that the present policy that you follow is com-
mendable and it certainly supplements. The American people I
think are entitled to know that a careful outside body selected
three panels of truly experts who reviewed all of his writings and
expressed an opinion concerning them.
  I am a little interested in just one or two things. I noticed that
one of your members is William J. Brennan, III, of New Jersey. Is
that the grandson of the Justice who just left the Court?

   Mr. LANCASTER. He is the son.

  Senator HEFLIN. He is the son. That is sort of unusual.
  The methodology that was used with your reading panels, you
had an interview in which all members of your committee were
present and interviewed, or were they separate? How was the
interview or interviews with Judge Souter conducted?
  Mr. LANCASTER. First, Senator Heflin, you will recall that we in-
vestigated Judge Souter for the first circuit earlier this year. That
investigation was conducted, as are all our investigations for dis-
trict and court of appeals judges, by the circuit member who has
the responsibility for that jurisdiction. In this case, that was Alice
Richmond.
  In the course of that investigation, Ms. Richmond spent a sub-
stantial amount of time with Judge Souter in an interview with
him and the results of that interview were then, as they always
are, shared with the other members of the committee.
  In this instance, the investigation for the appointment to the Su-
preme Court, the three people appearing before you tonight trav-
eled to New Hampshire and visited with Judge Souter for an ex-
tended interview, and then there were additional telephonic inter-
views. Over the course of that entire period, I would estimate that
we spent some 10 to 15 hours in discussions with Judge Souter.
  Senator HEFLIN. MS. Richmond, in your investigation for the first
circuit and again in regards to this, I assume you followed the
methodology of contacting lawyers and judges who had practiced
before Judge Souter and got their opinion. Were lay citizens also
contacted?
  Ms. RICHMOND. NO, sir. I spoke with lawyers and judges in New
Hampshire and throughout the first circuit, I think probably in
excess of 100 or 125.
  Mr. LANCASTER. There were, however, Senator, some lay people
contacted throughout the rest of the country.
  Senator HEFLIN. In your investigation, Ms. Richmond, other than
perhaps what we might say derogatory, and that may be too tough
of a word, pertaining to judicial philosophy that undoubtedly was
                                      351

expressed as you interviewed various people, were there complaints
from any person pertaining to personal temperament or were there
complaints that were made about him in that regard?

  Ms. RICHMOND. Well, as you know, Senator, your committee
promises confidentiality, and so I would be very hesitant to answer
the question in a way that would indicate that anyone made nega-
tive comments about Judge Souter, particularly if those comments
could be traced.

  I think it fair to say that the vast, vast majority of the people
with whom I spoke had nothing but praise for Judge Souter's tem-
perament.

  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Very briefly, I join in the thanks to the American Bar Associa-
tion for the work which you have done. You certainly could not be
an irrelevancy, to draw Senator Grassley's comment to that extent.
I think you have had a very profound effect, as evidenced by my
good friend's comments.
  When you do not find anything differently from what we have
found, that does not suggest an irrelevancy, it buttresses what we
have done. But you might well have found something that would
be different, and I think on other occasions the American Bar Asso-
ciation has found matters which are different.
  When the American Bar Association undertook to look at philos-
ophy, we were well-qualified to ascribe the appropriate weight to
your findings. We were not obligated to pay any undue deference
to your philosophy, when that was expressed, but we had a very
useful hearing and I think the parameters have been established as
to what the Judiciary Committee would like to hear, in terms of
professional competency and I think you have performed a very
valuable service.
  I would like to add that it is not only Supreme Court nominees
that your committee functions, and in that area, we do a consider-
able amount of work. But when you report that you have read all
220 opinions, that is something I did not do. I read several dozens
of them, but I did not read all 220. My staff did and selected the
ones for me to read. But when you have done that, that is a very
considerable undertaking and I thank you for it.
  But I think it ought to be comment that, on a Supreme Court
nominee, which is high profile and widely noted, which is not an
irrelevancy in the close attention given by the members of the Ju-
diciary Committee, although some are absent now, that you evalu-
ate all of the Federal judges, the district judges and the court of
appeals judges, and if you attend the Judiciary Committee hearings
on those judges, two is the maximum customarily, and sometimes
only one.
  When a fellow named David H. Souter appeared before the Judi-
ciary Committee for the first circuit a few months ago, two mem-
bers were present and one was present accidentally, because he
had a member of his own State there and that was me. Only Sena-
tor Kennedy was there presiding and I happened to be there, be-
cause there were Pennsylvania nominees there.
                                      352
  And I know that you have done mammoth work on many, many
judges with long files and interviewed a great many people, so that
the American Bar Association has performed a great public service,
and if you do exceed the bounds of relevancy, we will be able to
figure that out and give it appropriate weight.
  I thank you for that, and I thank you especially for staying so
late.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I just want to join in commending you, and I am pleased that one
of the members of the reading committees was from Northwestern
University School of Law in the State of Illinois. My wife is an
alumna of that school.
  Let me just ask one very, very minor question. As I look at the
reading committees, two of the three are entirely made up of law
school professors. The third has a majority of law school professors.
Not that having practicing attorneys as, say, a fourth reading com-
mittee would make a difference, but was that considered at all, or
is it just not practical because of the enormous volume of reading
there?
  Mr. LANCASTER. Historically, the practice had been to have read-
ing committees from law schools and then to have a reading com-
mittee usually of associates from the office of the chair of the com-
mittee.
  We followed the practice of having two reading committees in
this instance from two respected law schools. It was a suggestion of
some of the members of our committee, particularly one from the
ninth circuit, that instead of using associates from the law firm of
the chair of the committee, that we ought to go outside that arena
and obtain someone who had national prominence and national re-
spect, and enlist that individual in the selection of others who had
particular expertise with the Supreme Court, either as professors
or as practitioners.
  I called Rex Lee, in whom I have great confidence. I think he has
a national reputation, not only for great expertise as a lawyer, but
also as an individual, great respect from the community, and I told
him exactly what our function is, that our role is solely to investi-
gate professional competence, judicial temperament and integrity,
and I asked him to put together this list, to select the members on
his committee, and I left the selection to him, so that there could
not be any suggestion that somehow I had influenced that selec-
tion, and that is how it came about, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. OK. And generally you have found this worked
satisfactorily?
  Mr. LANCASTER. This is the first time that we have used it, but
we have been very pleased with it. As our report reflects, there was
remarkable consistency in the reports that we received from these
three committees working independently to investigate through the
reading of Judge Souter's opinions.
  Senator SIMON. I did not remember this from the previous nomi-
nations, and the reason I did not remember it is we had not done it
before.
                                               353

  Mr. LANCASTER. Exactly.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you very much.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  You all are very good to be here. I assume you did not think this
was going to be a referendum on the ABA. I hope we are beyond
this, because I do think it is relevant, that if someone is out of the
mainstream of interpretation of the Constitution and application of
constitutional law, that is different than the last 70 years of prece-
dent and the last 70 years of members on the bench, that I hope
you would say, hey, wait a minute, at least point that out to us, if
we did not already know it.
  I agree with Senator Specter, the job that you do for this commit-
tee--I might briefly, with you sitting here, and I mean briefly, ex-
plain the process.
  I have just proposed and introduced legislation calling for the es-
tablishment of another 70 judges, 77, if I am not mistaken. Over
the period of this year, I will probably have this committee decide
on somewhere in excess of 100 judges. There are as many as 175 in
1 year, counting vacancies in one Congress and new appointees,
and your input is extremely valuable.
  No one Senator could sit and do all of those hearings. We have a
five-person investigative staff that is augmented, not directly but
indirectly, by the work that your committee does, and it is always
first rate and you have always been involved, and as long as I am
chairman and I have anything to do with it, you will continue to
be, because you are of great assistance to the committee.
  As I indicated, Mr. Lancaster, and as the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania indicated, we know enough to know whether or not we want
to accept your recommendation. All it is is a recommendation. It is
not chiseled in stone. It is a recommendation, but one that I value
greatly and I value your time and your effort that you put into this
a great deal.
  Is there anything any one of you would like to make as a closing
comment?
  Mr. LANCASTER. I think, Senator, on behalf of the committee, I
will thank those members who spoke so glowingly of our work. I
will tell you, from my own personal experience in now my seventh
year on this committee, that I have never served on a committee
which has given me greater satisfaction. I think it makes an enor-
mous contribution to the judicial system of this country and I am
very proud of the way it works.
  I can only say, finally--and I regret that Senator Grassley is not
here to hear this--that there was an extended discussion this after-
noon of what is meant by congressional silence, and I would not
want the record to reflect that, by my silence and my refusal or
inability to respond to Senator Grassley, that I in any way agreed
or disagreed with his comments. I think everyone here knows how
I would have responded, had I responded.
  Finally, my term eventually, and perhaps sooner than later, will
come to an end, and if Senator Grassley wants to give me a gold
watch, I would be happy to take it. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Well said.
                                                354

  Mr. RANGEL. I just want to add one thing. I have been on the
committee now for a year and I have been impressed with the
amount of time that all the committee members have put in the
work of the committee.

  Also, I would like to thank the chairman for giving us the oppor-
tunity and giving me the opportunity to be here today.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I have never seen a time when you have
not--as a matter of fact, the only time the criticism has been forth-
coming is usually because you take so much time, that is, you put
so much effort into it. I expect people just thought you to be a
rubber stamp and you have not been that.

  With that, I thank you. It passes. I have been here 18 years. The
first 7 or 8 years, the liberals are always mad at you, and the then
for about 4 years nobody is angry at you, and now the conserv-
atives are angry with you. You must be doing something right, be-
cause everyone has been angry with you at one time or another.

  I thank you very much for your time. Thank you, Ms. Richmond,
for participating. And I am glad to see that there is a Texan there
to balance off New England in this process. [Laughter.]

  Mr. RANGEL. Thank you, Senator.
  Mr. LANCASTER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thanks again. We appreciate it.
  Now, this is a very unusual circumstance for anyone to keep a
Governor waiting at all. Governor, you have been extremely gra-
cious. Would you please come forward.
  I want to note, as you are taking the stand, that your senior Sen-
ator implored me to put you on ahead of time and, as I indicated--
and I had discussion with the White House, as well--that the tradi-
tion has always been to put the ABA on first, for as long as I am
aware. It is a little bit like the President asking the first question
to--I guess it is the AP, is it--the AP reporter, and I hope you un-
derstand.
  I noticed that you have a beautiful young woman with you.
  Governor GREGG. She is my staff.
  The CHAIRMAN. She is your staff. Is that your daughter?
  Governor GREGG. My daughter, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Molly, is it?
  Governor GREGG. Molly, 12 years old and got out of school today
to see the deliberative process, which she has never seen.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very, very much for being so gracious
today. It is probably the most boring thing you have ever done, al-
though having three children myself, having a daddy in politics,
she probably can think of things that are even more boring in your
experience. Thank you, honey, for being here today.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, we ought to note that Molly is
skipping school today, let the record show that here.

   The CHAIRMAN. NO, she

  Governor GREGG. But learning much. This had definitely been a
schooling experience for her.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I think it is worth it and I would not be
surprised, the Governor may very well have cancelled school today,
so Molly could come, I do not know. I thank you.

  Would you like to make an opening comment at all, Senator
Humphrey?
                                         355

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, I thank Governor Gregg for his pa-
tience and for waiting all day. I do think that we ought to consider
changing precedent, that Governors are more important and out-
rank even the ABA, as high and mighty as the ABA thinks it is. In
all seriousness, I do think we ought not to keep Governors waiting.
ABA can wait, but Governors ought to go first, it seems to me. I
hope we can consider that in the future.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Senator.
  As you know, Governor Gregg, it is not even the practice to have
a Governor testify alone. Usually, you would be put on a panel
with other important people like Senators who wish to testify, like
tomorrow. So, we have made an exception in having you testify
alone, Governor, which was your request, to not be part of a panel,
and I hope you are in no way offended. I think Governors are im-
portant and I thank you for being here.
  With that, Governor, we would welcome any comment you have
to make.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JUDD GREGG, GOVERNOR, STATE OF NEW

                                   HAMPSHIRE

  Governor GREGG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Let me begin by stating that, as the ABA, I did not want to be
the center of controversy over being a Governor testifying.
  I would like to congratulate the chairman. I have been extraordi-
narily impressed with the way these hearings have been managed.
I have watched them, as everyone in New Hampshire is watching
them, with intense interest, and have been very impressed with
your fairness as the Chair, and with the manner in which you have
allowed the questioning by your members. I served in the House
for 8 years and we did not have the sort of generosity of time that
you have here, and I think this hearing has been run in a way that
everyone who has participated in it can take great pride in having
participated in it, and you, Mr. Chairman, deserve a lot of respect
for having put the hearing together in this manner.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Governor.
  Governor GREGG. And as Governor, quite honestly, it has been
nice to be here all day. As you may know, we come from a small
State, as yourself, and most of the folks from New Hampshire are
now in Washington, so it is a great place to campaign. Most of my
constituents are already down here. [Laughter.]
  I do have a written statement and, because of the lateness of the
hour and because of the fact that the Chair has been so courteous
in allowing me to go forward at this time, I would just like to sum-
marize it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Take your time, seriously. I have all the time
you would like to take.
  Governor GREGG. Thank you very much.
  I would like to begin, obviously, by thanking Senator Humphrey
for his welcoming remarks, but also thanking both Senator Hum-
phrey and Senator Rudman for their efforts to put me on the panel
here today and to allow me to testify.
  I come here today as Governor of New Hampshire, obviously,
and I believe I speak for the people of the State of New Hampshire
                                      356
when I say that we, as a State, are extraordinarily proud of the
achievements of Justice Souter, and believe that he will be an ex-
ceptionally talented, thoughtful, concerned and effective addition
to the membership of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  That, obviously, has to be clear to you folks, after having listened
to him now for approximately 30 hours.

  I am a member of the New Hampshire bar, having joined the bar
a few years after Justice Souter, therefore, our lives, both profes-
sionally and privately, have sort of paralleled each other, and,
thus, I have gotten to know him quite well, because we have a
small bar and in our State everyone knows everyone else.

  It would be hard, therefore, for me to think of anyone, after
having reviewed Justice Souter's experience from the standpoint of
personal knowledge, to think of anyone with a higher level of per-
sonal integrity, wit, caring, quite honestly, and just plain Yankee
common sense.

  He is an extraordinary individual and I would not have higher
recommendation for anyone that would come before this commit-
tee.

  I do not want to spend any time on the issues which you have
been discussing in the area of expertise and jurisprudence, because
those are your areas of responsibility. I would like to address, how-
ever, two areas that I think, as Governor, I can speak to which
have been uniquely raised.

  The first is the editorial comment to the effect that Judge Souter
is not a national figure, whose face is not readily known and writ-
ings not readily seen in our urban media centers. And for this
reason, because he is not a national figure, I have seen editorial
comment, and I am sure you have seen it, which implies that
maybe he should not be moved up to the Supreme Court of the
United States.

  Having served 8 years in Washington, I put this down to "there
ain't no smart people outside of Washington" syndrome, to which
all of us have been exposed.

  However, the history of the Supreme Court is that it has had
members, who have been enumerable, quite honestly, who have
turned into quite extraordinary jurists who had no prior national
experience. Everyone on this committee, of course, represents some
place other than the city of Washington, and there is no doubt that
you can think back to your States, and do often, and I am sure
return to your States, as I know you all do in a fairly regular
manner, think back to your home towns and think of individuals
who are extraordinary people within your States and communities,
but who have no national recognition.

  But if those individuals were brought to Washington--and I re-
member when I was in Congress, I used to think of such individ-
uals quite often, depending on the area of responsibility that I was
addressing as a Member of Congress--if those individuals were
brought to Washington, whatever area of expertise they happened
to have as their own--and I am not just talking about the jurists, I
am talking about people in other areas of expertise--you know and
I know that those individuals would excel and would dominate,
quite honestly, here in Washington, as members of our National
                                      357

Government, and would be tremendous contributors to our Nation-
al Government.

  So, I think the concept that you have to be from Washington or
have to hold some sort of national recognition, in order to be
moved to the position of the Supreme Court, belies the fact which
we are all very much familiar with, as politicians from home
States--I having returned home--that there is an awful lot of
talent out there amongst our citizenry, and that this Nation has
traditionally turned to that talent for 200 years and that talent has
produced and produced consistently and extraordinarily, especially
on the Supreme Court.

  There is no question that David Souter does not step forward,
therefore, as an acclaimed national figure, prior to his identifica-
tion as a nominee for this job. But in the minds of the people with
whom he serves in New Hampshire, there is also no question, that
you will find no one who is more talented, capable, able or fairer
and more better positioned to assume the Supreme Court member-
ship.

  The second issue I would like to address is one which I address to
you, as politicians and as a politician. You must be as concerned as
I am with single-issue politics. All of us have been through a varie-
ty of campaigns, or else we would not have assumed the position
we now have.

  We understand the debilitating effect that single-issue politics is
having on our political system. Whether or not I can govern the
State of New Hampshire well and whether or not you folks can be
effective as Members of the Senate, in the most extraordinary and
significant legislative body ever put on the face of the Earth, does
not come down to your views on one single issue.

  How many times, however, have we seen certain groups within
our political spectrum demanding that, as their litmus test of good
government, only one view will be acknowledged? This approach ig-
nores the basic art of governance, which is the resolving of a varie-
ty of issues confronted in a constant flow of ever-changing events.

  The next Justice appointed to the Supreme Court is not going
not serve you a year or two. He will serve for a generation. He will
be Molly's Justice. Within that generation, the variety of issues
which will be faced by this Court cannot even be guessed at, much
less specifically listed. Issues of significance will arise that go far
beyond any single issue which may be the current topic of the day.

  It is, therefore, ironic that those of us who should most under-
stand the debilitating nature of single-issue politics should allow
this forum to be dominated by the editorial writers of this country,
by single-issue evaluation.

  I do not know nor do I really seek to know the position of Justice
Souter on the issue of Roe v. Wade, and I guess, as a Governor, I
have been on the point of this issue as much as any other Governor
in the country, being put in the position of vetoing, quite honestly
without any regret, but with a strong and firm belief, a bill which
would have given New Hampshire the most broad, liberal abortion
rights in the country. I am unabashedly a pro-life proponent.

  What I do know is that Justice Souter is one of the most thought-
ful and intelligent, capable, considerable, witty and reasonable per-
                                      358
sons that I have had the chance to serve with, as a fellow attorney
and State officeholder and Member of Congress.

  This is what I believe should be evaluated: The character of the
individual and his basic sense of the structure of our Government
and the direction and terms of our Constitution.

  Let us not make the same mistakes of a single-minded emphasis
that we so often see in our daily political lives. Let us not go down
the path of single-issue politics when we are addressing a nomina-
tion for a generation. We, of all people, should be most sensitive to
the detriment of such a course.

  Again, I wish to thank you very much for the opportunity to be
here today to speak on behalf of my friend, Justice Souter. Clearly,
the citizens of New Hampshire take great pride in his nomination.
We hope that you, the members of the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee, agree with us that, in Justice Souter, you have the opportunity
to confirm to the Supreme Court someone who will continue the
dreams and reality that make up our freedoms, as guaranteed by
the Constitution of the United States.

  Thank you very much. I appreciate your courtesy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Governor.
  Questions, Senator?
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Governor Gregg. As you noted,
New Hampshire is not one of the largest States. Have you ever
heard a negative word within the legal profession or without about
Judge Souter?
  Governor GREGG. NO, other than the fact that his mailbox leans
to the left, if you look at it from the road. [Laughter.]
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, we have been through the grass and
the mailbox and the black and white TV and all of that, his pecu-
liarities, if you will. But I do find it remarkable that there has not
been a negative note expressed by anyone in our State, neither Re-
publican nor Democrat nor conservative nor liberal, no one that I
am aware of has raised one negative note in connection with this
nomination. I think that is pretty extraordinary.
  Governor GREGG. Well, it is extraordinary, it is especially ex-
traordinary for New Hampshire, which is intensely political as a
result of our quadrennial events, and we have here today members
of the political spectrum on both sides strongly endorsing Judge
Souter's nomination, people who are very much the leadership of
both parties, and reflects I think the fact that Judge Souter is con-
sidered to be, above everything else, a fair individual.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you for coming, Governor. I am sorry
you have had to wait. You have been here since what time this
morning?
  Governor GREGG. Oh, we arrived reasonably early. We wanted to
see the entire day's activities.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I know that you and your daughter and staff
have been here since this morning, so it has been a long day and it
is going to be an even longer day before you get home tonight, but
we appreciate your coming and your participation and your pa-
tience.
  Governor GREGG. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Governor, from Judge Souter's perspective inside
the house, the mailbox leans to the right.
                                      359
  Senator HUMPHREY. We hope so.
  The CHAIRMAN. And it is nice having your own plane, isn't it?
  Senator HUMPHREY. It is unusual. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU mentioned you have been a lawyer for 30
years. Have you ever tried a case with or against Judge Souter,
when you were a lawyer?
  Governor GREGG. I have not quite been an attorney for 30 years.
  Senator HEFLIN. I thought you said
  Governor GREGG. If I did, I misstated. I have been an attorney
since 1973 or 1974, I have forgotten which date when I became a
member of the bar, maybe it was 1972, and I have not practiced
since going into politics and being elected to Congress, so I had a
window of practice of about 8 years, during which time I did prac-
tice, at least in one instance that I recall, before Justice Souter.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU practiced before him as a judge?
  Governor GREGG. Yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. Not as a lawyer in a case, where you were with
him or against him?
  Governor GREGG. NO, I never had--well, I obviously had dealings
with the attorney general's office when he was attorney general,
but the attorney general in New Hampshire does not try cases.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I had the privilege of serving briefly on a committee in the House
with the Governor when he was there. Totally apart from what is
pending, I understand that you anticipate the State senate is going
to take a downhill turn starting next year in New Hampshire.
  Governor GREGG. Well, we look at it as a tremendous expression
of the acknowledgment of the value of State government, that a
U.S. Senator would return to the State of New Hampshire and par-
ticipate in State government. We see that as an expression of
where the action is.
  Senator SIMON. OK. I simply want to join in expressing our ap-
preciation for your being here and for being so patient for so long.
We appreciate it.
  Governor GREGG. Thank you, Senator. I certainly enjoyed having
the opportunity to serve with you on the Science Committee.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Molly, let me say to you, honey, that if you have not had a
chance to have dinner yet, dessert is on me, unless daddy is taking
you straight home, because you deserve something special today for
being here all this time.
  Is there any closing comment you would like to make, Governor?
  Governor GREGG. I appreciate your courtesy, Senator. Thank you
very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for taking the time. The fact that the
Governor of a State would take such a large amount of time out of
his schedule to testify on behalf of a nominee for the Supreme
Court testifies very well to the caliber of the man that you are tes-
                                      360
tifying on behalf of. We appreciate it very much and we thank you
very much.

  Governor GREGG. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. With that, the hearing is adjourned until 10
o'clock tomorrow morning.
  [Whereupon, at 8:24 p.m., the hearing was adjourned, to recon-
vene on Tuesday, September 18, 1990, at 10 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO BE AS-
  SOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
  OF THE UNITED STATES

                      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1990

                                                                      U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in room
216, Senate Hart Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Spec-
ter, and Humphrey.
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will please come to order.
  We begin this morning with our panels of public witnesses, who
have asked to come before the panel to suggest why they are for or
against the nomination of Judge Souter. Many who will be testify-
ing today, such as our first two witnesses, represent not only them-
selves but a significant coalition of people that belong to their orga-
nizations. We will have a number of organizations represented by
their leadership here today and I expect tomorrow.
  We have not an inordinately large number of people, although I
must admit it is shifting in terms of those who are seeking to testi-
fy and those who are deciding they may not want to testify. But we
have roughly 10 different panels of people, in varying sizes from 2
to 6 on a panel.
  I am going to respectfully request that my colleagues and the
witnesses move by a slightly different set of rules than we did
when questioning the nominee. That is, rather than haying half-
hour question periods, we will only have 10-minute questioning pe-
riods by each of the Senators. We would ask our witnesses, if it is
possible--and it is very difficult to do this--to try to limit their
opening statement in the range of 5 minutes. And those who can't
do that, sort of nod to me, and I will ask you 5 minutes' worth of
additional questions that will allow you to finish your statement.
  But if we can, try, all kidding aside, to keep it to roughly 5 min-
utes. Otherwise, we are going to be here for a long time. But, if
necessary, we will be here for a long time because this is a very,
very important hearing. And although we are in all probability to-
tally finished with any testimony we will hear from the nominee,
the testimony from public witnesses is a very important element
here, and the committee very much wants to hear what they have
to say.

                                                        (361)
                                              362

  We start off with, in my view, two very important witnesses rep-
resenting large organizations who have a keen interest in some of
the subject matter that was discussed here. We are very fortunate
to have with us today Ms. Kate Michelman, executive director of
National Abortion Rights Action League, and Ms. Faye Wattleton,
president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

  I welcome you both, and I suggest that unless you all have decid-
ed who should go first, we should start with Ms. Michelman, if that
is appropriate. And if that is, then without further ado, welcome,
Ms. Michelman. It is a pleasure to have you here. Please begin
with your statement.

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, if I can just mention this, Senator
Metzenbaum would be here, but he is on the floor with one of his
bills, and he asked me to mention that. Otherwise, he would be
here to hear both of you.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am confident that is true, and I am sure the
same is true with Senator Kennedy as well as, I expect, Senators
on the other side as well.

  Again, welcome. Thank you for being here.

PANEL CONSISTING OF KATE MICHELMAN, EXECUTIVE DIREC-
  TOR, NATIONAL ABORTION RIGHTS ACTION LEAGUE; AND FAY
  WATTLETON, PRESIDENT, PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERA-
  TION OF AMERICA

                    STATEMENT OF KATE MICHELMAN

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Senator Simon, Mr. Chairman, and
members of the Judiciary Committee. On behalf of the 450,000
members of the National Abortion Rights Action League, thank
you very much for the opportunity to testify.

  Our opposition to this nomination was not arrived at lightly. We
examined the selection process by which President Bush nominated
Judge Souter. We conducted a thorough and searching examination
of his record and considered the impact this nominee could have on
the Supreme Court at this very critical historic juncture. Like most
of you, we have been impressed by Judge Souter's intellect, knowl-
edge, and wit. But Judge Souter's personal qualifications are not
the issue. The issue is whether or not the Supreme Court will con-
tinue to uphold the fundamental constitutional right to privacy, in-
cluding the right to choose.

  Mr. Chairman, I know that the Judiciary Committee has many
important considerations, but the health and the lives of millions
of American women are at stake. This nomination process is not
about arcane legal theory or dry historical precedent. Before Roe v.
Wade, millions of American women had to face the horrors of ille-
gal back-alley abortions. I know from very personal experience the
shame and the degradation endured by women who were forced to
disclose the most intimate details of their lives to panels of strang-
ers who had absolute power over their lives.

  Those shameful days could represent our future as well as our
past. For the very first time in our Nation's history, the Supreme
Court is on the very brink of taking away an established funda-
mental constitutional right. At best, we are just one vote away
from losing our right to choose. This results directly from the 10-
                                                   363

year legacy of administrations using the judicial appointment proc-
ess to attain the goal of depriving women of the right that is abso-
lutely central to every aspect of their entire lives. Under these ex-
traordinary circumstances, we urge you to withhold your consent
to the nomination of Judge Souter to the Supreme Court unless
you are absolutely certain--absolutely certain--that he will respect
and protect our fundamental right to privacy, including the right
to choose.

  Nothing in Judge Souter's record or his testimony has convinced
us that he, indeed, recognizes a fundamental right to privacy, in-
cluding the right to choose. After listening to the testimony, we
remain intensely concerned that, if confirmed, Judge Souter would
destroy 17 years of precedent and cast the deciding vote to overrule
Roe v. Wade. And we cannot overlook Judge Souter's suggestion
yesterday that unmarried people may not even have a fundamental
right to use contraception, which indicates an unacceptably narrow
view of our constitutional protections.

  Judge Souter has refused to even discuss his general approach to
discerning whether there is a fundamental right to choose. And I
must say that if there were any question, any question at all, about
whether Judge Souter supported the principles upheld in Brown v.
Board of Education, surely he would not be confirmed without of-
fering clear assurances that he supports the constitutional princi-
ple of equality. Roe v. Wade was the single most important decision
affecting the lives and health of American women. It should be
considered as clearly settled as Brown v. Board of Education.

  Judge Souter has indicated that he believes the right to choose is
open for reevaluation. Roe v. Wade has become an integral part of
the fabric of the lives of women and families. It is the foundation
for layers of rulings that grant us medical options and protect our
most personal decisions.

  We understand that abortion is a complex issue that involves se-
rious moral, religious, ethical, and philosophical questions. Some of
us may differ on what circumstances for terminating a crisis preg-
nancy are consistent with our own moral views. But the fundamen-
tal principle established in Roe v. Wade was that the decision must
be left in the hands of the individual and not the State.

  Mr. Chairman, the life, the health, the lives, the future of mil-
lions of American women rest in the Senate's hands. You are the
conscience of the U.S. Constitution. Confirming a new Supreme
Court Justice is a momentous task that will affect generations to
come. We recognize that you face pressure to fill this vacancy on
the Court, and we also recognize that Judge Souter has won consid-
erable support. But I would suggest that there is a time for politics,
and there is a time for principle. The politics may be difficult, but
the principle is clear.

  At stake in this confirmation process is nothing less than the
future of the constitutional protection of a woman's fundamental
right to make her own reproductive decisions. But the right to
choose does not exist in a vacuum. It is entwined with all the fun-
damental liberties that comprise our Bill of Rights. No woman--no
woman--can be truly free and self-determining if the Government
has the power to compel her to continue a pregnancy and undergo
childbirth against her will.
                                               364

  We consider placing Judge Souter on the Supreme Court to be
too great a risk. We urge you to put the health and lives of Ameri-
can women above every other consideration and withhold your con-
sent to this nominee.

  Mr. Chairman, I have with me some supplementary materials
relevant to Judge Souter's record which I would like to make part
of the official record at this time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be made part of the
record.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

                           THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS OF JUDGE DAVID SOUTER:
                                        THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT

NARAL The circumstances surrounding Judge Souter's nomination are exceptional. For the first
            time in the history of the United States, the Supreme Court is poised to take away a
            fundamental constitutional right. This is a direct result of an unprecedented,
            decade-long effort on the part of the Reagan and Bush Administrations to appoint judges
            and Justices who would use their positions on the federal bench to dismantle the
            fundamental right to choose. Judge Souter's nomination may be the final component of
            this strategy, which to date has been frighteningly successful: the Court is at best
            one vote away from overturning Roe v. Wade. The Senate has a responsibility not to
            acquiesce in the Bush Administration's anti-choice agenda, but to use its "advice and
            consent" role to ensure that Justices are not appointed on the basis of their
            willingness to deprive Americans of their fundamental rights. Unless Judge Souter
            openly recognizes the fundamental right to privacy, including the right to choose
            abortion, the Senate should not confirm his nomination.

Abortion: Fundamental Right or Ordinary Liberty Internt

An acknowledgement by Judge Souter that privacy is an ordinary liberty interest or a
generalized value or right protected by the United States Constitution would provide
absolutely no reassurance that as a Supreme Court Justice he would protect the
fundamental right to choose. Virtually all -- including those who would overrule
Roe -- acknowledge that the right to privacy is constitutionally protected.

        * Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Kennedy voted to overrule Roe
        in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, while at the same time stating that
        the right to choose abortion is a "liberty interest" protected by the due process
        clause of the 14th amendment.

        * During his confirmation hearings Justice Kennedy, who voted in Webster to
        overrule Roe, stated that the Constitution protects the right to privacy: "I
        think that the concept of liberty in the due process clause is quite expansive,
        quite sufficient, to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately
        think are part of their constitutional heritage."

        * Justice White and then-Justice Rehnquist in a dissent in Thornburgh v. American
        College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calling for the overruling of Roe.
        stated that they "certainly agree with the proposition . . . that a woman's
        ability to choose an abortion is a species of 'liberty' that is subject to the
        general protections of the Due Process Clause." Justices White and Rehnquist were
        the original dissenters in Roe v. Wade and have been calling for its reversal ever
        since.

The critical question is whether the right to choose abortion is protected as a
fundamental right. Only fundamental rights, such as the right to free speech and the
right to privacy, including the right to use contraception and to choose abortion,
receive strict scrutiny from the courts - the highest level of constitutional
protection afforded any right. Under the strict scrutiny standard, a law that
infringes a fundamental right is unconstitutional unless it is necessary to further a
compelling state interest.

Ordinary liberty interests are protected by the lowest level of constitutional
protection available. Under the rational relation test, a law that infringes on a
liberty interest is constitutional as long as the law furthers a reasonable state
interest. Whereas the strict scrutiny standard provides strong protection for the

rights of individuals, the rational relation test is extremely deferential to the power
of government to interfere with ordinary liberty interests.

Judicial Annolntmenti and the Reagan /Bush Antl-Cholce Agenda

The Souter nomination must be recognized for what it is: part of a decade-long legacy
under which Presidents Reagan and Bush have appointed judges based on their hostility
toward the fundamental right to choose abortion.

        * The Republican Party Platforms of 1980, 1984 and 1988 include a commitment to
        appoint only those judges and Justices who do not support a woman's fundamental
        right to decide whether to have an abortion.

        * Judge Souter was on the list of potential Supreme Court nominees passed on from
        President Reagan to President Bush.

        * White House Chief of Staff John Sununu offered personal reassurances to ease
        the fears of conservatives who were concerned that Judge Souter might not vote to
        overturn Roe. Sununu indicated that for conservatives the nomination is "a home
        run - and the ball is still ascending. In fact, it's just about to leave earth
        orbit."

        * "Strict construction", "judicial restraint" and other key phrases used by the
        push Administration to describe Judge Souter's judicial philosophy are recognized
        by anti-choice leaders as code words for a predisposition to overrule decisions
        protecting the fundamental right to privacy, in particulai the right to choose
        abortion.

Judge Souter's Record on Privacy and Abortion

A careful review of Judge Souter's record reveals that he has not recognized privacy as
a fundamental constitutional right and that, given the opportunity, he is likely to
join those on the Supreme Court who have voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.

        * In a case that Judge Souter lists among his "ten most significant opinions," he
        applied the doctrine of "original intent." Original intent is the extremely
        restrictive judicial philosophy employed to argue not only against constitutional
        protection for the fundamental right to privacy and to choose abortion, but also
        against any heightened constitutional protection for women from sex
        discrimination.

        * As Attorney General, Judge Souter opposed the repeal of New Hampshire's 1848
        law criminalizing virtually all abortions, citing as his reason his unfounded fear
        that repeal would make New Hampshire the "abortion mill" of the United States.

        * Also as Attorney General for New Hampshire, Judge Souter submitted a brief that
        describes abortion using biased and inflammatory language that is inappropriate to
        a legal brief. The brief refers to the exercise of the constitutionally
        protected right to choose as the "killing of unborn children."

        * A fundamental responsibility of our independent judiciary is to protect the
        rights of individuals against unwarranted governmental interference. As a New
        Hampshire Supreme Court Judge, David Souter time and time again embraced the
        power of the state over the rights of individuals.

                       JUDGE SOUTER'S RECORD ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND ABORTION

NARAL

               President George Bush's nomination of Judge David Souter follows a decade of appointments
               of federal judges by Presidents Bush and Reagan under an anti-choice litmus test. The
               Republican Party Platforms of 1980, 1984 and 1988 called for "the appointment of judges
               at all levels of the judiciary who respect . . . the sanctity of innocent human life."
               With the appointments during that time of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor,
               Scalia and Kennedy, the Supreme Court now stands on the brink of depriving Americans of a
               recognized fundamental constitutional right for the first time in our Nation's history.

               In order to allay the concerns of conservatives who feared that Souter might not vote to
               overturn Roe, conservative activist Pat McGuigan circulated a memo detailing a private
               meeting in which John Sununu indicated that the Bush Administration has a clear sense of
               where Judge Souter stands and that conservatives should be pleased with the nomination.
               Sununu described the choice of Souter as follows: "This is a home run -- and the ball is
               still ascending. In fact, it's just about to leave earth orbit."

               Characterizations of Judge Souter's Judicial Philosophy: 1990
               President Bush has made Judge Souter's judicial philosophy a key issue in the
               confirmation process by citing it as the basis for his nomination. The Bush
               Administration's descriptions of Judge Souter's judicial philosophy -- "original
               intent," "strict construction" and "judicial restraint" -- are recognized by leaders of
               groups that oppose legal abortion as code words for a predisposition to overrule
               decisions protecting the fundamental right to privacy, including the right to choose
               abortion.

               Dissent in In re Estate of Dionne: 1986
               Judge Souter's most revealing -- and alarming - opinion while on the New Hampshire
               Supreme Court is one that he has listed among his "ten most significant opinions." In a
               dissent interpreting a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution in In re Estate of
               Dionne. 318 A.2d 178 (1986), Judge Souter used the extremely restrictive judicial
               philosophy of "original intent." This doctrine would limit the meaning of a
               constitutional provision to the specific practices and beliefs that were prevalent at
               the time the provision was adopted, freezing the Constitution in the past and allowing
               for no adaptation to current times. If the U.S. Supreme Court were to apply this
               approach, the Court would overrule not only Roe v. Wade, but also other cases involving
               the fundamental right to privacy, including the right to use contraception. Under a
               strict application of this reasoning. Brown v. Board of Education could not have put a
               halt to the racial segregation of our Nation's schools, and women would be afforded no
               constitutional protection from sex discrimination.

               Concurrence in Smith v. Cote: 1986
               Judge Souter concurred in a decision allowing a woman to sue her doctor for negligence
               for failing to warn her of the possibility of birth defects and the option of abortion.
               In a separate opinion, however, Judge Souter went beyond the issue before the court and
               expressed concern that the court would be misunderstood as instructing anti-choice
               physicians to render tests and counseling despite their personal opposition to abortion.
               Judge Souter concluded that timely disclosure of the physician's moral scruples and
               referral to another physician would suffice. Significantly, Judge Souter refers to
               abortion as "necessarily permitted under Roe v. Wade." rather than describing abortion as
               a fundamental right protected under the Constitution. This calls into question whether

                                  368

Judge Souter would uphold the right to choose if he were not bound to follow Supreme
Court precedent.

Letter to the Legislature about "Parental Consent" Bill: 1981
Judge Souter, as a New Hampshire Superior Court judge, wrote a letter in 1981 to the
state Legislature on behalf of the Superior Court concerning a pending bill that
required teenagers to obtain the consent of their parents or a judge before obtaining an
abortion. Judge Souter's letter objected to the proposed judicial involvement, on the
ground that the bypass procedure would force judges to engage in 'acts of unfettered
personal choice" and to make "fundamental moral decisions." The letter took no position
on the underlying question of whether young women should be required to obtain parental
consent. The letter was used by pro-choice activists to defeat the parental consent bill
then before the legislature, because the U.S. Supreme Court had at the time declared that
a judicial bypass must be part of any law requiring parental consent. Yet the letter
suggests that, because of his opposition to the judicial bypass, Judge Souter might vote
with the Justices who would allow states to mandate parental consent in every case,
without any judicial escape valve even for teenagers who are the victims of family
violence. The letter is also disturbing in that it advocates the principle of "judicial
restraint," which is often used as a code word by those who seek to overrule Rfis,

Opposition to Repeal of Criminal Abortion Law: 1977
While Attorney General of New Hampshire, Judge Souter successfully opposed the repeal of
a law enacted in 1848 which imposed criminal penalties for the performance of an
abortion. Only abortions necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman were
excepted; the law contained no exception for -rape, incest or health endangermen'.
Although the law was clearly unconstitutional and unenforceable under Roe v. Wad *.. it
remained on the books (and still does). In an attempt to justify his opposition to the
repeal of this extreme law. Judge Souter used the specious threat of large numbers of
women pouring into New Hampshire for post-viability abortions: "Quite apart from the
fact that I don't think unlimited abortions ought to be allowed, if the State of New
Hampshire left the situation as it is now, I presume we would become the abortion-mill
of the United States." In fact, few women choose to have post-viability abortions -
only .01 percent of abortions currently are performed after 24 weeks -- and those who do
have very compelling reasons, including serious risks posed to their health by pregnancy
and severe fetal abnormalities detected late in pregnancy.

Brief Submitted in Coe v. Hooker: 1976
A 1976 brief, submitted by Judge Souter as Attorney General on behalf of the state,
refers to the constitutionally protected choice of abortion as "the killing of unborn
children." This language is the same rhetoric commonly used by extreme opponents of the
right to choose and is inappropriate for a state attorney general to use in a legal
brief. The brief argued against state funding of abortions for poor women, a position
which in no way required the use of language and reasoning that evidenced strong.
hostility to the fundamental right to choose.

Vote while Member on Hospital Board: 1973
Judge Souter was a board member of Concord Hospital and an overseer for the Dartmouth
Medical School, which is affiliated with the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center; both
hospitals perform abortions. A month after the Roe v. Wade decision, Judge Souter
participated in a vote of the Concord Hospital's board to allow doctors to perform
abortions there. The minutes of the meeting reflect no discussion or dissent on the
part of Judge Souter or other board members.

                                            JUDGE DAVID SOUTER'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

NARAL

              In reviewing Judge David Souter's record, NARAL's Legal Department has come across an
              opinion that is, thus far, the most significant in providing insight into his judicial
              philosophy and how he might rule on critical issues of individual rights, including the
              right to privacy. In interpreting the New Hampshire Constitution in a dissenting opinion
              in In re Estate of Dionne. 518 A.2d 178 (1986), Judge Souter used the extremely
              restrictive judicial philosophy of "original intent," which limits the meaning of a
              constitutional provision to the specific practices and beliefs that were prevalent at the
              time the provision was adopted. If the U.S. Supreme Court were to apply this approach,
              the Court would overrule not only Roe v. Wade, but also other cases involving the
              fundamental right to privacy, including the right to use contraception. In fact, this is
              the very approach that was used at the time of Brown v. Board of Education to argue that
              states should be permitted to continue segregating schools by race.

              Judge Souter's opinions do not reveal to what extent he would apply his reasoning in
              Dionne when interpreting federal constitutional provisions protecting individual rights.
              Yet this opinion cannot be dismissed as atypical. In response to a Senate Judiciary
              Committee questionnaire following his recent nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
              the First Circuit, Judge Souter listed his dissent in Dionne as one of his "ten most
              significant opinions." Given the profound implications if he were to use an originalist
              approach as a Supreme Court Justice, Judge Souter must be closely questioned during his
              Senate confirmation hearings about the Dionne case and his judicial philosophy
              concerning interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.

              Judge Souter's Use of "Original Intent"

              In Dionne. the Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that a statute requiring citizens to
              pay a fee to a judge in exchange for a special court session violated the state
              constitution, which guaranteed to citizens the right "to obtain justice freely, without
              being obliged to purchase it." Although this mandatory payment to a judge clearly
              contradicted the plain language of the constitution and -- in the words of the four
              justices in the majority -- "smacks of the purchase of justice," Judge Souter alone
              dissented. He stated that in interpreting the state constitution, the court could look
              only to the precise practices the framers intended to prohibit in 1784, and he used as
              his principal evidence of that intent the way in which a similar clause of the Magna
              Carta of 1215 had been interpreted.

              Judge Souter's dogmatic approach to original intent in Dionne is cause for alarm. If
              Judge Souter's originalist approach were used to interpret the equal protection clause of
              the Fourteenth Amendment, the relevant evidence would be the prevailing practices at the
              time of the Amendment's adoption in 1868. Brown v. Board of Education could not have put
              a halt to the racial segregation of our nation's schools, and women would be afforded no
              constitutional protection from sex discrimination. In Brown. Chief Justice Earl Warren
              -- writing for a unanimous Supreme Court -- explicitly rejected an originalist approach,
              stating, "[w]e cannot turn back the clock to 1868 when the amendment was adopted."

              If confirmed, Judge Souter would replace Justice William Brennan, who believed that the
              true intent of the Framers was for the Constitution to provide broad principles capable
              of adapting over time to new and unforeseeable circumstances. In Justice Brennan's view,

"the ultimate question must be, what do the words of the text mean in our time. For the
genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world
that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with
current problems and current needs."

Implications for Roe v. Wade

The doctrine of original intent has been used by ideologically conservative judges, such
as Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, to deny the existence of the fundamental
right to privacy and call for the overruling of Roe v. Wade. As Judge Bork stated, "I
would think an originalist judge would have no problem whatever in overruling a non-
originalist precedent, because that precedent by the very basis of his judicial
philosophy, has no legitimacy. It comes from nothing that the framers intended."
Accordingly, Bork stated that "Roe, as the greatest example and symbol of the judicial
usurpation of democratic prerogatives in this century, should be overturned."

President Bush has made Judge Souter's judicial philosophy a key issue in the
confirmation process by citing it as the basis for his nomination. The phrases being
used to describe Judge Souter's judicial philosophy -- "original intent," "strict
construction" and "judicial restraint" ·· are recognized by the most vehement opponents
of legal abortion as code words for a predisposition by Judge Souter to overrule
decisions protecting the fundamental right to privacy, including the right to choose
abortion:

        Pro-Life Action League leader Joe Scheidler: "[A]ny judge who truly seeks to
        follow the original intent of the framers of the Constitution in applying the
        law will be hard-pressed to find anything in the Constitution to support a
        right to abortion. Since the care of human life is the first object of good
        government, David Souter or any other strict constructionist must seek to
        overturn Rjjfi,"

        Susan Smith, Associate Legislative Director of the National Right to Life
        Committee: "President Bush has said that this is a man who is committed to
        interpreting the Constitution, not legislating from the bench and since Roe v.
        Wade is really the zenith of judicial activism, I think it's reasonable to
        assume that a Justice like Judge Souter would continue the erosion of a tragic
        constitutional error that is Roe v. Wade."

Conclusion

Judge Souter's strict adherence to the doctrine of original intent in the Dionne case,
and the Bush Administration's repeated characterization of his judicial philosophy as one
of judicial restraint, place in serious question whether Judge Souter, if confirmed,
would continue to protect Americans' fundamental right to privacy. It is therefore
essential for the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Judge Souter regarding his
precise judicial philosophy. Americans must know if Judge Souter will limit our
constitutional guarantees to those of centuries past, leaving us without protection from
unwarranted governmental intrusion into our most personal decisions.

                         PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S RECORD ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

IIMnML. p r e s i c j e n t George Bush's nomination of David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court must be
              considered in the context of Bush's overall record of catering to the anti-choice
               minority. For the last decade, Bush has been part of administrations that again and
               again have gone to great lengths to deprive women of their fundamental right to
               choose abortion. At the heart of the assault on the right to choose is a strategy to
               overrule Roe v. Wade by changing the make-up of the federal judiciary -- and in
               particular the U.S. Supreme Court - by appointing only judges who pass an anti-
               choice litmus test. With this vacancy on the Supreme Court, following the
               appointments since 1980 of three Supreme Court Justices, a new Chief Justice and over
               half the federal judiciary, President Bush is now on the brink of achieving that
               objective.

               Republican Party Platforms of 1980. 1984 and 1988

               President Bush -- like President Ronald Reagan before him - ran on a Republican
               Party platform committed to creating a federal judiciary that would be hostile to the
               right to choose and ultimately overrule Roe v. Wade and its progeny.

               The 1980 Republican Party Platform states:

                         We will work for the appointmen of judges at all levels of the judiciary who
                         respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.1

               The 1984 and 1988 Republican Party Platforms state:

                         We applaud President Reagan's fine record of judicial appointments, and we
                         reaffirm our support for the appointment of judges at all levels of the
                         judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent
                         human life.1

               Judicial Appointments

               Judge David Souter was included among what White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray
               described as the "files and institutional memory" on potential Supreme Court nominees
              passed on from President Reagan to President Bush.3

               When asked if President Bush uses the same "screening apparatus" that President
               Reagan used to "insure that judicial candidates were sympathetic to . . .
              conservative jurisprudence," White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray replied, "It's
              structured a little bit differently, but the result is very much the same." He added
               that the Administration's aim "is to shift the courts in a more conservative
              direction."4

              Ethan Bronner, in his book Battle for Justice, states, "During Reagan's first term
              . . . [a] nine-member Presidential Committee on Federal Judicial Selection sifted
              through the [Court] nominees' writings and speeches in search of genuine conservative
              ideology. Those present at interviews said potential nominees were asked about their
              views on abortion and on the rights of criminal defendants."5

              Herman Schwartz, in his book Packing the Courts, states, "White House Counsel Fred

Fielding . · . admitted that the Reagan Administration tries to choose only 'people
of a certain philosophy' and that someone 'actively prochoice' or 'for defendants'
rights' would not make 'the final cut.'"*

Attorney General Edwin Meese conceded that "we dfl discuss the law with judicial
candidates . . . In discussing the law with lawyers there is really no way oal to
bring up cases -- past cases -- and engage in a dialogue over the reasoning and
merits of particular decisions.*7

Bruce Fein, who worked on judicial selection in the Justice Department during
Reagan's first term, told Newsweek: "It became evident after the first term that
there was no way to make legislative gains in many areas of social and civil rights.
The President has to do it by changing the jurisprudence."*

Other Appointments

When Bush's selection for HHS Secretary, Louis Sullivan, said in an interview that he
favored a woman's right to choose abortion, anti-choice groups pledged to fight the
nomination. To appease the anti-choice extremists, the White House worked to silence
Sullivan and put together a "package" of approved anti-choice appointees for top
staff at HHS, including Kay James, a former National Right to Life Committee
official.9

Prior to her nomination as Surgeon General, Antonia Novello was questioned to satisfy
the Bush Administration that her abortion views w e e consistent with President Bush's
opposition to the right to choose.10

Dr. William Danforth, a candidate for director of the National I

A candidate to be chair of the Legal Services Corporation, Caldwell Butler, was
eliminated from consideration for indicating to interrogators that he thought a
pregnant woman should have access to information on her legal right to choose
abortion.1*

Other Anti-Choice Policies

Under both President Bush and President Reagan, the U.S. Justice Department urged the
Supreme Court to overrule Roe v. Wade and deprive women of the fundamental right to
choose. Most recently, the Bush Adminstration argued in Hodgson v. Minnesota.
decided June 1990, that the Court should reach out and overrule Roe, even though the
parties had not raised the issue and the case involved the narrower issue of the
constitutionality of legislation requiring teenagers to notify their parents before
obtaining abortions.13

In 1990, an interagency group convened by the White House proposed funding school-
based clinics. Although the White House acknowledged that the plan would be
effective in reducing teen pregnancies and the number of single-parent families, it
rejected the proposal, fearing "political problems among groups that are opposed to
                                        373

      birth control."14
      In 1989, Congress voted to restore the availability of Medicaid funids for abortions
      in cases of rape and incest, but President Bush vetoed the bill. He aliso twice
      vetoed a bill that would have allowed the people of Washington, D.C. to use th
      locally generated tax dollars to pay for the abortions of poor women.1*
      In 1989, the Bush Administration extended a ban on federally funded research
      involving fetal tissue transplants, ignoring the recommendations of an advisory panel
      convened by the National Institutes of Health and elevating the absolutist views of
      anti-choice extremists over the well-being of millions of Americans who suffer from
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, radiation sickness,
      diabetes and other serious illnesses l s
      The Reagan-Bush Administration severely restricted Title X of the Public Health
      Service Act, which provides reproductive health care services for low-income women
      and is the largest single source of federal support for family planning in the United
      States. Through regulations -- which are currently being defended by the Bush
      Administration in a legal challenge before the U.S. Supreme Court -- federal funding
      is denied to any family planning clinic that uses even entirely private funds to
      advise its clients that abortion is a legal option or to refer clients elsewhere for
      abortion services, unless this information is provided in physically and financially
      separate facilities.17
      The Reagan-Bush Administration sponsored and administered the Adolescent Family Life
      Act, which gives federal funds to anti-choice religious groups n teach adolescents
      about sexuality Under this program, religious groups have discouraged teens from
      using contraception by teaching them that it is a sin and by providing teens with
      entirely false information about the health risks associated with the various methods
      of contraception.18
      The "Mexico City Policy" supported by President Bush denies funds to overseas family
      planning programs that provide privately funded abortion services or counseling.
      Bush vetoed a bill containing funds for "cherished" foreign policy programs because
      it contained family planning funds for the United Nations Family Planning Fund. The
      Reagan-Bush Administration withdrew all federal funding (S17 million) from the
      International Planned Parenthood Federation because the Federation used some of its
      money (less than one percent, and all private funds) for abortion-related activities.
      The Federation estimated that the loss of federal funding would result in an
      additional 776,000 unwanted pregnancies and 100,880 abortions in more than 100
      countries.19

                 THE ROLE OF THE SENATE IN SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS

NARAL

               There is a long, distinguished and bi-partisan history of Senators questioning
       nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court about their judicial philosophy and their views
       with regard to the "great issues of the day" President Bush has explicitly and
       repeatedly stated that judicial philosophy was one of the key reasons he selected
       Judge David Souter. It is hypocritical and without constitutional foundation for the
       President to suggest that the Senate has no right even to inquire about the very
       judicial philosophy that was the basis for his nomination of Souter. Certainly no
       one suggests that the President's reasons for exercising his veto power should be
       constrained because it is the Congress's prerogative to legislate

               For the last decade, the Bush and Reagan Administrations have appointed federal
       judges -- amounting to over half of the federal judiciary -- according to an anti-
       choice litmus test. The 1988 Republican Party Platform ~ upon which President Bush
       was elected -- echoed the platforms of 1980 and 1984: "we reaffirm our support for
       the appointment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional
       family values and the sanctity of innocent human life." President Bush's deliberate
       selection of a. nominee with no public record only intensifies the Senate's obligation
       to ask critical questions.

               No one is suggesting that Judge Souter is required to state how he would decide
       a specific fact-contingent case prior to reviewing the record and reading the briefs.
       At issue are questions concerning the constitutional standards and legal reasoning
       that would be generally applied to all cases dealing with Americans' right to privacy
       and reproductive autonomy. As is made clear by the following quotations from various
       Senators, as well as excerpts from the writings of Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
       such questions are entirely appropriate, indeed essential.

               The Supreme Court is now on the brink of depriving Americans of a fundamental
       constitutional right for the first time in our Nation's history. In 1958 nominee
       Potter Stewart was asked for his views of the Court's recent and controversial
       decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Americans today have a right to know where
       a nominee stands on the fundamental right to privacy in making decisions concerning
       reproduction.

       I. Quotations from United States Senators Concerning the Role of the Senate In

               Confirming Supreme Court Nominees

       Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) (re: nomination of Anthony Kennedy):
               "There is widespread misunderstanding about the Senate's role . . . . These
               proceedings constitute really the apex of the separation of powers under our
               Constitution. All three branches are involved The President makes the
               nomination; it is up to the Senate to consent or not; and then the nominee who
               is successful goes to the court and has the final word over both the executive
               branch and the legislative branch. So there are really very important issues
               involved." (1987)

                                 376

Sen. Samuel Ervin (D-NC) (re: nomination of Thurgood Marshall):
          "I believe that the duty which . . . .the Constitution imposes upon a Senator

         requires him to ascertain as far as he humanly can the constitutional philosophy
         of any nominee to the Supreme Court." (1967)

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC) (re: nomination of Abe Fortas):
         "It is my contention that the Supreme Court has assumed such a powerful role as
        a policymaker that the Senate must necessarily be concerned with the views of
         prospective Justices or Chief Justices as it relates to broad issues confronting
         the American people and the role of the Court in dealing with these issues."
         (1968)

Sen William Borah (R-ID) (re: nomination of John J. Parker):
        "Upon some judicial tribunals it is enough, perhaps, that there be men of
         integrity and of great learning in the law, but upon this tribunal
        something more is needed, something more is called for, here the widest,
         broadest, deepest questions of government and governmental politics are
         involved." (1930)

Sen. George Norris (R-NE) (re: nomination of John Parker):
        "When-we are passing on a judge,... we ought not only to know whether he is a
        good lawyer, not only whether he is honest -- and I admit that this nominee
         possesses both of those qualifications - but we ought to know how he approaches
         these great questions of human liberty." (1930)

Sen. John McClellan (D-AR) (re: nomination of Abe Fortas):
        "I think we have greater responsibility than to determine that the nominee is
         honest and has the required legal ability because today, particularly in these
         troubled times, it is the philosophy and the approach that a judge may make in
        arriving at decisions, that can be even more dangerous than lack of ability or
         lack of complete integrity. If we should be ruled by a dangerous philosophy, we
        can surely come to a tragic end." (1968)

Sen. Harry Byrd, Jr. (D-VA) (re: nomination of Abe Fortas):
        "[I]f we do not examine their philosophy, if we do not determine where they
        stand on the great issues of the day, then . . . it seems to me we might as well
        go back to our hometowns and practice law, run a newspaper, or do whatever we
        want to do, and cease being a part of the processes of the U.S. Senate." (1968)

In a Senate Executive Report Sens. Birch Bayh (D-IN), Philip Hart (D-MI), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA), and John Tunney (D-CA) wrote (re: nomination of Rehnquist):

        "The Executive has the . . . burden of proof when it comes forward with a
        Supreme Court nominee. . . . [I]t must run the risk that the Senate will act on
        the basis of the only substantive record available and, on this "best evidence,"
        reject the President's choice." (1971)

II. Quotation! from now-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Harvard Law Record. "The
        Making of a Supreme Court Justice," Oct. 8, 1959.

"The Court in Brown v. Board of Education held in effect that the framers of the
Fourteenth Amendment left it to the Court to decide what 'due process' and 'equal
protection' meant . . . . Given this state of things in March, 1957, what could have
been more important to the Senate than Mr. Justice Whittaker's views on equal
                                  377

protection and due process? . . . . The only way for the Senate to learn of these
sympathies is to 'inquire of men on their way to the Supreme Court something of their
views on these questions." p. 10.

On the confirmation of Charles Evans Whittaker: "Examination of the Congressional
Record for debate relating to his confirmation reveals a startling dearth of inquiry
or even concern over the views of the new Justice on constitutional interpretation."
P. 7

"Given . . . the fact that Mr. Justice Whittaker had been an eminently successful
courtroom lawyer, the fact that he had been a leader in the activities of the
organized bar, and the fact that he had been very highly regarded as a judge of the
lower federal courts - all of which he was - the Senators could still have no
indication of what Mr. Justice Whittaker thought about the Supreme Court and
segregation or about the Supreme Court and Communism." p. 8.

III. Sample Question! and Answers Concerning the Reasoning in Specific Cases from
          Senate Confirmation Hearings

Confirmation hearings of Justice Kennedy:

Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA):
          How do you respond to the concern that your opinion reflects a narrow approach
          to the civil rights laws as the Supreme Court has interpreted those laws?

Judge Kennedy responded:
          "It is entirely proper, of course, for you to seek assurance that a nominee to
          the Supreme Court of the United States is sensitive to civil rights."

Sen Arlen Specter (R-PA):
          "I would like to begin with Brown v. Board of Education, the desegregation case.
          In examining the issue of the framers' intent . . . Congressman Wilson, the
          sponsor in the House of the 14th Amendment, stated, 'Civil rights do not mean
          that all citizens shall sit on juries or that their children shall attend the
          same schools.' . . . . Now my question is; Is it ever appropriate for the
          Supreme Court to decide a case at variance with the framers' intent?"

Judge Kennedy responded:
          ". . . . In my view, the 14th amendment was intended to eliminate discrimination
          in public facilities on the day that it was passed. . . . I think Brown v. Board
          of Education was right when it was decided, and I think it would have been right
          if it had been decided 80 years before. I think Plessv v. Ferguson was wrong on
          the day it was decided."

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC):
          "Judge Kennedy, 20 years have passed since the Miranda v. Arizona decision which
          defined the parameters of police conduct for interrogating suspects in custody.
          Since this decision the Supreme Court has limited the scope of Miranda
          violations in some cases. Do you feel that the efforts and comments of top law-
          enforcement officers throughout the country have had any effect on the Court's
          views, and what is your general view concerning the warnings this decision
                                 378

         requires?"
Judge Kennedy responded:

         "The Court must recognize that these rules are preventative rules imposed by the
         Court in order to enforce constitutional guarantees; and that they have a
         pragmatic purpose; and if the rules are not working they should be changed."

Confirmation hearings of Justice O'Connor:

Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA):
         "Unlike the other nominees, Judge O'Connor, you do not have a strong record on
         major judicial issues for us to review. That is not your fault; that is because
         you served on State courts as opposed to Federal courts. . . . I hope that you
         will understand that in light of your lack of written record on major issues, it
         is our obligation in this hearing to attempt to insure that you do not prove as
         great a surprise to President Reagan as Earl Warren was to President
         Eisenhower."

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT):
         "Senator Biden asked you a question about Brown v. The Board of Education. It
         was on the subject of judicial activism, a term that I guess means many things
         to many people. You said that it did not create new social policy by the Court
         but was simply the Court reversing a previous holding based on new research, but
        that new research was not any new research into the Constitution or into the
         law was it? Was not that new research rather the effects of segregation on
        minorities? It certainly was not into congressional debates over the 14th
        amendment."

Judge O'Connor responded:
        "Senator, I think there was an element indeed of the examination of the intent
        of the drafters of the amendment. I am sure that particular case was impacted
        also by perceptions of the social impacts in that particular instance."
        · *· ·
        "Senator, I consider it as an accepted holding of the Court."

In response to a question concerning Miranda v. Arizona. Judge O'Connor stated:
        "I think the exclusionary rule . . . has proven to be much more difficult in

1986 Confirmation hearings of Chief Justice Rehnquist:

Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE):
        "Do you think that the decision ultimately reached in Brown was the incorrect
        decision?

Justice Rehnquist responded:
        "When Brown came down?"

Sen. Biden:

.,._..           ANALYSIS OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS
NAKAL                CONCERNING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

        PRIOR TO ROE V. WADE (prior to 1973)

        The origins of the fundamental right to privacy are deeply rooted in our nation's legal
        tradition, as the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v. Wade. 410 US. 113 (1973). Over the
        past century, the Court has held that profoundly personal decisions are protected
        against unwarranted governmental interference by the right to privacy. §££ Loving v.
        Virginia. 388 U.S. 1 (1967) (right to privacy protects the decision when and whether to
        marry); Pierce v. Society of Sisters. 268 U.S. 510 (1925) & Mever v. Nebraska. 262 US.
        390 (1923) (right to privacy protects decisions on how to raise one's children).

        The Court has long recognized that decisions concerning procreation are at the core of
        the right to privacy. Laws that interfere with an individual's procreative freedom are
        to be "strictly scrutinized" and are unconstitutional if not necessary to further a
        "compelling" state interest. Thus, in 1942 the Court invalidated a law that provided for
        the sterilization of "habitual criminals," Skinner v. Oklahoma. 316 U.S. 535. In 1965
        and 1972, the Court invalidated laws that prohibited the use of contraceptives, Griswold
        v. Connecticut. 381 U.S. 479; Eisenstadt v. Baird. 405 U.S. 438. The Court has described
        the right of the individual to decide when and whether to conceive or bear a child as
        being "at the very heart" of the fundamental right to privacy. Sfit Carev v. Population
        Services- 431 U.S. 678, 685 (1977).

        ROE V. WADE AND DOE V. BOLTON (1973)

        The Supreme Court declared in Roe v. Wade that the fundamental right to privacy,
        protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty, includes the right of a
        woman to decide whether or not to have an abortion. The Court invalidated a century-old
        Texas law prohibiting abortions not necessary to save the woman's life. This decision
        followed directly from the Court's 1965 ruling in Griswold. 381 U.S. 479, protecting the
        right to use contraception. Thus, the government may not interfere with a woman's
        abortion decision without demonstrating that a restriction is necessary to further a
        compelling state interest.

        The Court in Roe recognized two state interests sufficiently compelling to justify
        restrictions on a woman's right to choose. After fetal viability -- a point that varies
        with every pregnancy, but usually falls between 24 and 28 weeks - a state may prohibit
        abortion to protect the potentiality of life of the fetus, but only in cases in which the
        woman's health or life is not endangered by the pregnancy. A state may also regulate the
        abortion procedure after the first trimester -- 12 weeks - if the regulations are
        necessary to further the state's interest in protecting the woman's own health.

        The day the Court decided Roe, it also decided a second case concerning the right to
        choose abortion, Doe v. Bolton. 410 U.S. 179 (1973), which helps to clarify the Court's
        ruling; the Court stated in Roe, "that opinion and this one, of course, are to be read
        together." 410 U.S. at 165. In E2& the Court struck down as unconstitutional a more
        recently enacted Georgia law that required that all abortions be performed in hospitals
        and that women secure the approval of a hospital committee and three doctors before
        obtaining an abortion. Thus, the Court recognized that the Constitution prohibits not

only laws that would directly outlaw abortion, but also any restriction that may
undermine the right to choose through unwarranted governmental interference with women's
abortion decisions.

AFTER ROE V. WADE AND BEFORE WEBSTER V. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES
(1973 to 1989)

The Supreme Court most recently reaffirmed its holding in Roe in 1986 in Thornburgh v.
American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists, stating that "few decisions are more
personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and
autonomy than a woman's decision . . . whether to end her pregnancy." 476 U.S. 747, 772.
In the thirteen years between Roe and Thornburgh. the Court invalidated a wide variety
of restrictive abortion laws, including laws that required women to obtain their
husbands' consent prior to having an abortion. Planned Parenthood v. Danforth. 428 U.S.
52 (1976), forced women to wait a specified period of time before obtaining abortions,
City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. 462 U.S. 416 (1983), and imposed
biased, lengthy and inflexible "informed consent" requirements, Thornburgh. 476 U.S. 747;
Akron. 462 U.S. 416. Although the Court repeatedly reaffirmed Roe during this period,
the margin by which it did so steadily narrowed: Roe was decided by a decisive 7-2
margin, but by the 1986 Thornburgh decision, the vote to uphold Kfi£ was 5-4.

Even during this time period in which the Court continued to reaffirm RfiC the Court
upheld restrictive abortion la «s in two important areas. Contrary to the reproductive
freedom of young women and poor women, the Court upheld parental involvement
requirements and restrictions on public funding of abortions. Nevertheless, even in its
decisions upholding these restrictions, the Court expressly reaffirmed the basic
principle that the government may not interfere with an adult woman's fundamental right
to decide whether or not to end a pregnancy. The Court ruled that a state may require
some "immature" minors to obtain parental consent prior to having abortions. This
decision was based on the erroneous assumption that government-mandated parental
involvement is beneficial to some minors who are too immature to make decisions about
abortion on their own. In the public funding cases, while the Court reaffirmed that the
Constitution prohibits the government from imposing obstacles in the path of a woman's
choice of abortion, it found that the government may refuse to remove obstacles to
abortion that the government did not itself create, such as a woman's indigence.

WEBSTER V. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES (1989)

In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. 109 S. Ct. 3040 (1989), the Supreme Court
upheld the constitutionality of challenged provisions of a restrictive Missouri abortion
law, including a prohibition on the use of public facilities (broadly defined) and public
employees to perform abortions and a requirement that doctors perform tests to determine
fetal gestational age, weight and lung maturity before performing an abortion on a woman
believed to be more than nineteen weeks pregnant.

The Webster case was the first time in the sixteen years since Roe that only a minority
of the Justices (four Justices) recognized the fundamental right to choose and voted to
reaffirm Rfl£. Four other Justices voted in effect to overrule &g£ Justice Scalia did
so explicitly and another three Justices did so implicitly, by reducing the fundamental
right to choose to a "liberty interest," not entitled to the same high level of
constitutional protection, and describing the state's interest in the fetus as
"compelling" even in the earliest stages of pregnancy.
                                 381

Justice O'Connor provided the fifth, essential vote to uphold the Missouri law, but she
did so on narrow grounds, stating that it was unnecessary to reconsider Roe because the
law passed the "strict scrutiny" standard of review Thus, Webster did not overrule Roe.
Justice O'Connor indicated, however, that she favors adopting a different standard of
review for abortion laws -- an "undue burden" standard -- which would provide less
protection than is afforded fundamental rights and would, if adopted, amount to an
overruling of Roe

SINCE WEBSTER (1989 to present)

On June 25, 1990 the Supreme Court decided two cases -- in a complicated series of

separate opinions -- that involved the constitutionality of state statutes that placed

restrictions on the ability of minors to obtain legal abortions. In Hodgson v.

Minnesota.  US  , 58 U.S L.W 4957 (U.S. June 25, 1990), the Court essentially

upheld the constitutionality of a Minnesota statute requiring 48-hour advance

notification of both parents with a judicial bypass option, but ruled that a state must

provide a judicial bypass as an alternative to a two-parent notice requirement. In Ohio

v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health.  U.S         , 58 U.S.L.W. 4979 (U.S. June 25,

1990), the Court upheld an Ohio statute requiring 24-hour advance notification of one

parent with a judicial bypass that was challenged as deficient. Although the Court had

in prior cases allowed states to restrict teenagers' access to abortion services, these

decisions allow for even greater state interference.

In terms of the continued vitality of Roe v. Wade, as in Webster, only a minority of the
Justices reaffirmed Roe. In fact, the Hodgson decision undermined Roe even further. For
the first time. Justice O'Connor -- who, prior to Justice Brennan's retirement, was
clearly the critical vote on the right to privacy -- applied her "undue burden" standard
of review in voting with the majority to uphold a restrictive abortion statute.
Moreover, she applied this new standard in a manner that affords little constitutional
protection: she found no "undue burden" in requiring minor women to notify both parents
without any judicial bypass option, even in cases of divorce or desertion and over the
objections of the custodial parent, although she did find that this requirement was
irrational. Although Justice O'Connor will likely apply this "undue burden" standard in
future abortion cases, including those involving adult women. Roe v. Wade remains the law
of the land. Lower courts must continue to apply strict scrutiny in reviewing abortion
restrictions until such time as the Supreme Court may actually overrule Roe and adopt a
new standard of review.

FUTURE CASES

With Justice Brennan's recent resignation, only three remaining Justices on the Supreme
Court recognize the fundamental right to privacy, including a woman's right to decide
whether or not to have an abortion. Even if Justice O'Connor refrains from casting her
vote to overrule Roe, there is no longer a majority on the Supreme Court to reaffirm Roe.
If Justice Bcennan is replaced with a Justice who will not protect a woman's fundamental
right to decide whether or not to have an abortion, there will be a clear majority on the
Court who will vote to overrule Roe v. Wade.

   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Wattleton.

                     STATEMENT OF FAY WATTLETON

   Ms. WATTLETON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the commit-
tee. It is also my pleasure to speak before you this morning.

   I speak as the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund,
which is the political advocacy arm of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America [PPFA]. PPFA is the Nation's oldest and
largest nonprofit, private provider of reproductive health care in
this country. For 75 years, we have given men and women access to
the information and medical care that enable them to decide when
and if they will be parents. Every year, nearly 2 million Ameri-
cans--many of them young and poor--come to our 879 medical cen-
ters. We are not a special interest group, as some have implied.
Our views represent those of millions of Americans--as a matter of
fact, the majority of Americans--who want to preserve their right
to make their most fundamental private reproductive decisions.

  Last week, David Souter told us that the responsibility of a Su-
preme Court Justice, and I quote, "is to make the promises of the
Constitution a reality for our time and to preserve that Constitu-
tion for generations that will follow us." We agree completely. We
also believe that one of the promises of our Constitution is the pro-
tection of our fundamental right of privacy and reproductive free-
dom.

  Until these hearings, Judge Souter's views on these constitution-
al promises were virtually unknown, and Planned Parenthood did
not oppose his nomination. Instead, supported by 87 percent of the
electorate, we asserted that Americans have the right to know
Judge Souter's views on fundamental issues such as the rights of
privacy and reproductive freedom.

  But after days of evasive answers and filibusters, we know little
more about his views on these issues than we did before the hear-
ings began, and what we do know is profoundly disturbing. It is
clear that Judge Souter sees reproductive freedom as an unsettled
issue. He does not accept reproductive rights as an established con-
stitutionally protected right, one of the promises of our Constitu-
tion.

  Judge Souter acknowledged the existence of a right to marital
privacy but would not acknowledge the right of married people to
use contraception as outlined in Griswold. He also refused to com-
ment on the later Eisenstadt decision that extended this right to
unmarried people.

  In fact, he said in regard to Griswold, and I quote, "If there were
a successful attack on Roe, that would call into question prior pri-
vacy cases." This is a contention that Planned Parenthood has
made all along.

  In other words, Americans may not have the fundamental right
to prevent unwanted pregnancy, much less the safety to terminate
a problem pregnancy.

  Judge Souter steadfastly refused to answer questions about a
woman's right to abortion, saying that it would be inappropriate
for him to comment because it is likely that Roe v. Wade would be
coming back to the Supreme Court. And yet he was willing to com-
                                         383

ment extensively on the appropriate standard of review for cases
including gender discrimination, the free exercise clause, racial dis-
crimination, all of which are likely, like Roe, to come before the
Court.

  He refused to tell Senator Kennedy if he considered abortion
moral or immoral, even in cases of rape or incest, saying it would,
and I quote again, "dispel the promise of impartiality in approach-
ing this issue" if it came before him. Yet Judge Souter has no
qualms about expressing his own moral views about the death pen-
alty and white-collar crime, issues on which the Supreme Court is
repeatedly asked to rule.

  The resignation of Justice Brennan has left the Supreme Court
precariously balanced. Last year, and again this year, the Court
issued decisions that seriously weakened Roe and unleashed whole-
sale assaults on reproductive rights in State legislatures nation-
wide. Indeed, when asked what the practical consequences of over-
turning Roe would be, Judge Souter reduced the issue to a Federal-
State squabble.

  Twenty-four years ago, when David Souter was counseling a
young woman in Boston facing an unwanted pregnancy, Planned
Parenthood was doing similar work, working with trained counsel-
ors, nurses and volunteers all over the United States. The one ex-
perience that Judge Souter claims as his sole source of sensitivity
on this critical issue of private life is an experience that Planned
Parenthood clinics cope with every day. We know, as do most
Americans, that Roe v. Wade liberated American women and saved
our lives like no other recent Supreme Court decision. Its real life
consequences have been matched by few judicial acts in the history
of our republic.

   For women and their families, the right to reproductive choice
creates a foundation for exercising many of the other constitutional
privileges we enjoy as Americans. Clearly, the health and well-
being of American women and of future generations that David
Souter expressed concern about will rest in the hands of the next
Supreme Court Justice. What choices will my daughter, your
daughters, our granddaughters have? Will the promises of our Con-
stitution remain a reality for them? It depends largely on the views
of the next Supreme Court Justice on privacy and reproductive
freedom.

   Any Supreme Court nominee who rejects the fundamental
nature of these privacy rights in a democracy must likewise be re-
jected by the citizens of that democracy. American women, quite
frankly, are quite tired of having our rights placed up for grabs.
We urge you to keep the faith of the American people and Ameri-
can women, women who will not forget who nominated the next
Justice and who confirmed him. We urge you to reject the nomina-
tion of David Hackett Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court, and there-
by send a message that the period of tolerance for political games-
manship around our fundamental reproductive rights has ended.

 Mr. ch«lna«n:

 Planned parenthood Federation of America is tha nation<t oldast
 and largest non-profit, private provider of reproductive health
aare. for 75 years we have given vonen and aen aooese to the
information and medical aare that enable them to decide when and
whether to have children. Every year nearly two million Americana
-- moat of then young and many of then poor -- find their way into
our 879 medical centers. We help Americana plan their families,
enhance their lives, and assure that children are born wanted and
loved.

For some in politics/ the dabate over aoe y. wadj boils down to
concerns about polls and votaa and oonstituanoy pressure, ror many
trained in the law, Bfis. is an interesting debating point, lut for
most Americans, the Boa v. wade decision was a liberating and life-
saving pronouncement. Its real-life consequences have been roatohad
by only a few judicial acts in the history of our republic. For
women and their families, the right to reproductive choice oreatai
a foundation for exercising many of the other constitutional
privileges we enjoy as Americans.

But last year and again this year, tha court that produced Roe
issued decisions that seriously weakened fcc* and unleashed
wholesale assaults on reproductive rights in state legislatures
nationwide. Now, the judge nominated to fill a vacancy on that
court is in a position to turn back the clock even further on
reproductive rights, to an era when providing or obtaining an
abortion was a criminal act.

Until these hearings, Mr. Bush's nominee was a virtual unknown.
Rather than oppose hie nomination, Planned Parenthood asserted
Americana1 right to know Judge Souter's views on fundamental rights
                                     386

 of prlvaoy and reproductive freedom, which are taken for
 by tha vast majority of Americans*

 Today, however, after daya of evasive anawara and filibusters, va
 Know nothing more about Judge Souter' a viawa on reproductive right*
 than wa did bafora tha hearings began.

 Judga Souter ha* acknowledged tha existence of a conatitutional
 right to marital privacy and a right to procreate, but would not
 acknowledge the right of married people to use contraception aa
 outlined in flrlawold. Ha also refused to comment on tha later
 giaanatadt decision that extended thia right to unmarried people.

 judga Souter steadfastly refused to answer questions about a
 woman's right to abortion, saying it would be inappropriate for
 him to comment, because of the likelihood of Roe coming back to
 the Supreme Court. Vet, as Senator Biden pointed out. Judge Soutar
 was willing to comment quite extensively on hie views on the
 appropriate standard of review for cases Involving gender
 discrimination, the free exercise clause and racial discrimination,
 all of which -- Ilka &£* -- ara likely to come beak to the Supreme
 Court.

Mr. Soutar refused to anawar Senator Kennedy's question about
whether ha oonsidera abortion moral or immoral, even in oases of
rape or incest, saying it would "dispel tha promise of impartiality
in approaching this issue" if it came bafora him. Yet, Mr. Soutar
had no qualms about expreeaing his own moral beliefs about the
death penalty and white collar crime.

Judga flouter'a story of having "counselled" a pregnant young woman
who planned to self-abort bafora abortion was legal in
Masiaohuaatta dearly was meant to assure pro-choice Americana that
                                    387

be reoogniied the pain and desperation of women who faoe unwanted
pregnancies. The story, however, only reveals that Mr. Souter
advised the young woman not to attempt a mmlt- abortion; it give*
us no clue as to his views on th« issue of legality.

Judge Soutttr also refused to address the eountarvailing interest
the state has that weighs against the woman's "liberty" intaraat
in terminating a pregnancy. Nor would ha say whathsr he beliavea
in the concept of constitutional Mpersonhood" from the moment of
conception*

Justice Brandeis once said, "If we would guide by the light of
reason, we must let our minds be bold." Judge Souter has displayed
no boldnesi whatsoever during thete hearings. The general opinion
Is that he has acquitted himself very well* That may be true in
the sense that he wade no mistakes and no commitments that would
hurt him.

But the health and lives of millions of American women, for
generations to come, may depend on where David flouter stands on
fundamental rights of privacy and reproductive freedom. The
American people will not tolerate a Supreme Court justice who
refuses to acknowledge those rights -- openly and unequivocally.
Any Supreme Court nominee who rejects the fundamental nature of
such rights in a democracy must likewise be rejected by the
oititens of that democracy.

We urge you to reject the nomination of David Hackett Souter to
the U.S. Supreme Court, and thereby send a message that the period
of toleranoe for political gamesmanship around our fundamental
reproductive rights has ended.
                                      388

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you both for your testimony. Obviously,
it is testimony you both not only gave but feel very strongly and
deeply.

  Let me probe a couple things, if I may. It is obvious that you did
not make your decision immediately. I expect that you were both
hoping you wouldn't come to testify. But let me be the devil's advo-
cate with you for a moment.

  Where do you think, based on his testimony, Judge Souter, if
confirmed, will sit on the spectrum of the Court on which he will
sit? Will he be a Scalia on your issues? Will he be a Kennedy? Will
he be an O'Connor? Will he be a Marshall? Clearly, you do not
think he will be a Marshall.

   Ms. MlCHELMAN. No.

  The CHAIRMAN. All kidding aside, I am very serious. Based on
his testimony, do you have any clear sense of how antagonistic
from your perspective to your views he will be? Because clearly, if
we said to you you can have another O'Connor on the bench or an-
other Scalia, I don't have any doubt which you would pick if you
had to take one of the two. Where do you think he will fit on the
spectrum of reproductive rights as guaranteed by the Constitution
based upon how the Court is now configured?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, Senator Biden, you have to remember
that Justice O'Connor has indicated most recently in the Hodgson
case her willingness to join the others in overturning Roe v. Wade.
So even if I were to say that I think Judge Souter

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am not suggesting you would like either.
I just am trying to get a sense of where, based on--since I only
have 10 minutes, I don't have the time to go in and probe each of
the statements. For example, I'd like to ask--well, I will. I will ask
you, Ms. Wattleton. You indicated that Judge Souter's assertion
toward the end of his testimony in response to a question--I think
by me, but I am not certain who it came from--he made the com-
ment that if, in fact, Roe were overruled, it would undo the fabric
of privacy cases all the way back to and through Griswold. I am
paraphrasing. Whereas, the Solicitor General, Mr. Freed, argued it
was just one thread that could be pulled out.

  It has always been your assertion that if Roe goes, the whole
progeny of cases that preceded it, the whole line of cases that pre-
ceded it would go. And I drew, quite frankly, some comfort from
that answer. You obviously were distressed by the answer. Tell me
why you found that distressful since he had gone on record as
saying he strongly recognizes the right of marital privacy, and the
core of that right is reproductive freedom or, specifically, the right
to use contraceptives, to choose whether or not to procreate.

  Now, you found the answer disturbing. I found it encouraging.
Here the guy says the anchor to Roe I agree with, and if you pull
out Roe, then that anchor may go. I read that as leaning toward,
well, maybe the fellow won't go that way. But I don't know any
more than I guess anyone knows. Tell me why it disturbed you.

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, it disturbed me, Senator Biden, for several
reasons. One, Mr. Souter did not say that he believed that there
was a constitutional foundation for Griswold. He said that he felt
that there were privacy protections for marital procreation. And
                                      389

when taken to Griswold, as I listened to him in the Senate hearing
room that day, he was reluctant to comment on it.

  It further disturbs us because, while Mr. Fried and Webster chose
only to take a threat out of privacy in the Hodgson and Ohio cases,
the Bush administration called the whole question of privacy
into--felt that the Supreme Court should call the whole question of
privacy as a constitutional protection. And so we felt that that was
quite disturbing. But, more, we believe that Roe is built on a foun-
dation of constitutionally protected rights of privacy. And if you
can find no right in the Constitution to protect privacy with re-
spect to Roe, then clearly it calls into question other reproductive
rights cases from which Roe emanated.

  It was an evolution of cases--Eisenstadt being one that the judge
chose not to comment on--leading up to the Roe decision in 1973.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we will go back and check the record. Obvi-
ously, none of us--I shouldn't say none of us. I know I don't know
how he is going to rule. I know you don't know for certain. Maybe
somebody over here knows, but I don't.

  My recollection was that he said he didn't want to comment on
specific cases, but he was pressed hard by me and others--by Sena-
tor Kennedy and others--on the principles, and he did firmly sub-
scribe to the principles.

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, I think that there was a question that was
asked about whether, if he support privacy for procreation--and I
believe that was your question--whether he saw the constitutional
protection extended to the right not to procreate. And he declined
to answer that question, and that was very disturbing to us.

  I think another aspect of it that I think places him out on the
wing with Scalia and Justice O'Connor was the question of strict
scrutiny and his tier evaluation of various State-imposed restric-
tions, which is quite disturbing to us because, before the most
recent Supreme Court decisions, the standard had been strict scru-
tiny, not whether the States could show that their restrictions were
unduly burdensome, or were not unduly burdensome.

  The CHAIRMAN. Again, I will not press that, not because you are
not fully capable of responding to it, but because I don't have the
time. But I will look into the record. My recollection was he re-
fused to comment at all on what tier he would use relative to that
issue. And he did acknowledge--which isn't telling us much, I ac-
knowledge. He did acknowledge that there was a liberty interest
that prevailed after pregnancy.

  Now, that doesn't tell us much at all because Justice Scalia ac-
knowledges there is a liberty interest that prevails.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you want to say something, Ms. Michelman?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Yes; I just wanted to add to what Faye has said;
that Judge Souter, also in discussing the area of privacy, suggested
that this area is absolutely open for reevaluation; and, in fact, he
said that it will be many years before this area of law is, in fact,
settled--which raises tremendous concern.
  The CHAIRMAN. But isn't that just stating the obvious?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, no. It shouldn't be because it is our belief
and contention that this is a 17-, 18-year-old law that is based on a
                                      390

body of law that should, in fact, be as settled as Brown v. Board is.
And it disturbs us that there is a suggestion that it is up for grabs.

  The CHAIRMAN. When I pressed that issue in another context, I
made the comparison to Brown. As a matter of fact, I went back
when I first met with the judge and with people who were with
him from the White House, and I asked him, I said:

   If you were up for nomination immediately before the Civil War and immediately
after the decision saying that black people could be viewed as property under the
Constitution, would you vote for any Justice before you knew whether or not that
Justice agreed or disagreed with that landmark case, the Dred Scott case?

  And everyone in the room said:

   No, I wouldn't do that.

  And I tried to make the point that a number of people feel equal-
ly as strongly as about reproductive freedom.

  But let me go back to the assertion by the judge, because I may
have misunderstood him. And I am not being solicitous when I say
I will go back and reread this portion of the testimony. When he
said that this whole area is still open, my impression was he was
attempting to make a clear distinction between whether or not he
thought it should or should not be open, and whether or not, as a
matter of fact, it was open; and that unlike Brown, there were no
intervening cases between the time of the core decision--in this
case, Roe--was decided and the time he had to testify, as there
have been in Roe; i.e., Webster; and that he was merely stating the
landscape of the law as it is today.

  Your impression was, as I understand it, that he wasn't giving us
a professorial analysis of the landscape of the law. He was giving
us his opinion as to whether or not it should or should not. Am I
correct?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think he was saying he is open, he is open to
listening rather than recognizing that there is a fundamental right
to privacy, including the right to choose. And, you know, it is not
just Webster that has happened. There is a whole line of cases--
Thornburgh, Aakron--there is a whole line of cases where the
Court reaffirmed strongly the principles established in Roe that a
woman's right to privacy includes her right to choose. And he
didn't acknowledge those. He just said this whole area is open.

  I think the risk here is very great.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I would further submit, Senator, that there
have been cases that relate to Brown since Brown. The whole ques-
tion of busing and how to effectively implement desegregation in
our Nation's schools is by no means a settled issue. And yet this
judge was willing to comment on the appropriateness of it, and we
take no issue with that.
  The concern that we have is that these are broad areas of con-
cern--that is, privacy, reproduction--major areas that affect the
lives of every single American. And to elevate a candidate to the
position of Justice of the Supreme Court without knowing his judi-
cial philosophy in these areas or with a vague or foggy idea of his
thinking on this is very dangerous, in our opinion.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for interrupt-
ing. I just wanted to make a short statement, that I haven't been
here and I won't be here, because I am handling a bill on the floor
                                         391

and I don't want the witnesses, either these or others who preceded
them or will follow them, I don't want them or others who will
follow them to feel that it's a lack of interest, but if there's a bill of
yours on the floor you must be there. I am saying to them as well
as the other witnesses who will be here today that I'm absent, but
not intentionally. It's just because of another responsibility.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Metzenbaum.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Senator, we appreciate that.
  The CHAIRMAN. My time is up. Let me conclude by saying this
and you may not be able to answer this. Is the basis of your testi-
mony here today that we know this man will overrule Roe v. Wade,
therefore, we're against him, or because we don't know that he
won't overrule Roe v. Wade, we are against him?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. All the evidence points to the fact that he will
overrule Roe and he has said nothing to allay our concerns.
  Ms. WATTLETON. We're opposed to him because he has refused to
answer the question straightforwardly and it is our fear that he
would vote not to continue the constitutional protections of privacy
that extend to the right to abortion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I have a number of other questions, but my
time is up. Let me yield to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Thank you, very much.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to welcome you ladies here.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Thank you, Senator.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. A member of the Supreme Court must make
decisions about hundreds, even thousands, of issues. Now, Judge
Souter has been a judge for some 14 years. The American Bar As-
sociation has held him well qualified. They have given him the
highest rating they can give any candidate for a judgeship.
  Now, without regard to your specific concern on the abortion
question, do you believe Judge Souter has the professional qualifi-
cations to serve on the Supreme Court?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, I certainly wouldn't quibble with the eval-
uation of the American Bar Association about his professional
qualifications. We might note that the American Bar does not
evaluate judicial philosophy. I mean that qualification does not
concern itself with judicial philosophy which I think is very much
at issue here, and judicial approach.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, either one of you can answer these
questions.
  Do you feel he has the integrity to be on the Supreme Court?
  Ms. WATTLETON. There is no evidence that there is any reason to
besmirch this particular candidate's integrity.
  Senator THURMOND. DO you feel he has the judicial temperament
to be on the Supreme Court?
  Ms. WATTLETON. The judicial what?
  Senator THURMOND. Temperament?
  Ms. WATTLETON. I find his judicial temperament very disturbing,
both in the cases that
  Senator THURMOND. Disturbing, you say?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Disturbing, yes. Both
                                      392
  Senator THURMOND. Would you explain why?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Yes; I am about to. Both in the cases that we
read prior to these hearings as well as in the discussions that he
had with you, during the proceedings.
  Senator THURMOND. DO you feel he has had the professional
qualifications, the professional competence to be on the Supreme
Court, regardless of his views on abortion?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, I don't believe that we can really judge
beyond what has been evaluated by professional groups that he has
the professional qualifications to sit on the Court, but that does not
mean that everyone who is professionally qualified to sit on the
Court should sit on the Court.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, again, I want to ask you without
regard to your specific concern on the abortion question, do you be-
lieve Judge Souter has the professional qualifications to serve on
the Supreme Court?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think we both have said, Senator, that we
have left that evaluation to the professional organizations and we
have no reason to dispute it. But as Ms. Wattleton just said, profes-
sional qualifications alone do not make a Supreme Court Justice.
  Senator THURMOND. If he doesn't favor the position that you
favor on abortion would you favor turning him down?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. We have established that unless Judge Souter
openly recognized a fundamental constitutional right to privacy, in-
cluding the right to choose, he should not be confirmed.
  Senator THURMOND. In other words, if his position on abortion is
not the same as yours, you would oppose him?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Senator Thurmond
  Senator THURMOND. That's a very plain question, I think.
  Ms. WATTLETON. That is a question that I think we have to make
clear that we are representing specific groups and constituencies.
Now, what our views may be as Americans are one thing in terms
of the broader context of his nomination. But, here today, we are
speaking on this specific area of our concern. And, yes, we would
oppose him if he does not and as he has not taken a position on
reproductive rights.
  Senator THURMOND. In other words, if he opposes your position
on abortion you would be against him?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. If he does not acknowledge the right to privacy
to include the right to choose. It is not his personal view on abor-
tion
  Senator THURMOND. That is what I'm asking. That is the very
question I'm asking you.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. The issue before us is whether there is a right,
a right, a fundamental right to choose and that is what is at issue.
I'm not really interested in his personal views. We all have differ-
ent views on abortion. It's really what, how he views the Constitu-
tion's role in protecting the individual's right to make this decision.
And he has not satisfied our concerns in that area.
  Senator THURMOND. Even though he has other qualifications to
be on the Supreme Court, if he doesn't take your view on abortion,
then you would be opposed to him.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, Senator, I think that I would put that in a
context of most Americans who see these issues as fundamental
                                      393
rights and are not interested in giving away any of our rights. If
this was a justice, or a judge that was totally qualified professional-
ly to sit on the Supreme Court and could find little protection or
questionable protections for my freedom of speech, he would not be
qualified to sit on the Court.

  So I see these questions as fundamental and if a justice does not
find constitutional protections for what Americans believe are
their fundamental rights, then, no, he should not sit on the Court.

  Senator THURMOND. What evidence do you have that he is
against your position, anyway?

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, the evidence is as Mr. Biden asked him to
remember that the burden of proof is on him to present to the com-
mittee his views, to convince this committee that it should confirm
him. With respect to privacy and reproductive rights, he steadfast-
ly declined to do so.

  Senator THURMOND. Well this question will be coming before the
Supreme Court again probably

  Ms. WATTLETON. SO will a myriad of other questions.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. So will many other questions in areas of law
that he was much more, I should say somewhat more forthcoming.
I'm not sure
  Senator THURMOND. Well, he declined to answer on a lot of ques-
tions there
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. He was much more, but somewhat
more.
  Senator THURMOND [continuing]. Questions that may come before
the Supreme Court.
  Ms. WATTLETON. He certainly didn't decline to answer on ques-
tions of capital punishment. He certainly didn't decline to answer
on questions of
  Senator THURMOND. DO you remember what he said, that I will
listen, do you remember him saying that?
  Ms. WATTLETON. I hope he will listen.
  Senator THURMOND. I will listen, I will listen and if he listens
and formed his own honest opinion about it what more can you ask
of a person?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. But, Senator, in our view, this law and this
body of law is old. He should have a view, and we have a right, the
American people have a right to know what his view is. He singled
this area of law out to avoid discussing, and as we have said over
and over other areas he was more open and more forthcoming, and
singled this one out. So I think that suggests some real concern.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I think also that we ought to expect any judge
who sits on the bench to have the capacity to listen, but from what
perspective will he listen is the question that is before us. So that
we were not comforted by his claims that he would listen. I think
that's a remedial requirement for any judge.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, people change their minds. Prior to
this decision, Roe v. Wade, the matters was with the States. The
judges change their minds and they took it to the Federal level and
now some of them would like to take it back; they changed their
minds.
  In the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896 which required sepa-
rate but equal facilities, the judges changed their minds in 1954.
                                      394
This man is openminded he says. He will listen and he impressed
me as the kind of man who would change his mind if he felt that
something in the past had gone wrong or conditions warranted
changing his mind.

  In fact, if I recollect correctly, he said he hadn't made up his
mind on the abortion question. Didn't he say that?

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, he did say that and that is very disturb-
ing

  Senator THURMOND. Well, if he said that, wouldn't you accept his
words on that?

  Ms. WATTLETON. Could I just finish? He did say that but after 18
years we find it enormously disturbing that an area of major con-
stitutional law is such that this person, who wants to sit on the Su-
preme Court, doesn't have a view on it and has not made up his
mind on it. Yes, there is no question that courts do change their
minds, but I believe this would be the first time that we would see
a Supreme Court position in which it has established a right, take
it away.

  I'm not interested as an African-American and as a woman
seeing the rights that I have come to expect as an American be re-
versed because a court changes its mind, and I believe we have to
speak out against any such development.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, my time is up. I just want to say, if he
is a man of integrity and character and says he hasn't made up his
mind, and he will listen, what more could you ask?

  That's all. Thank you. My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, if Senator Kennedy could with-
hold just a moment, I would also like to note something similar to
Senator Metzenbaum. We are in the process of putting together the
conference committee on the 5-year farm bill and while I was here
for all but 4 or 5 minutes of Judge Souter's testimony, I am going
to have to miss much of the testimony over the next couple of days.
I will follow it fully and my staff is going to brief me on it fully. I
do apologize to the witnesses, especially the two here, but that is
the reason why I'm not going to be here.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  I want to join in welcoming our witness and our panel this morn-
ing. In just listening to the exchange and the presentation to date,
I imagine that point you are making, and correct me if I'm wrong,
that you believe that this kind of a right is as basic and as funda-
mental to the Constitution as other rights, which are regularly ac-
cepted: the free speech, separation of church and State, the ability
to assemble, the basic guarantees of the 14th amendment in terms
of the protections of minorities in our country.
  As I understand you believe that those are basic and fundamen-
tal and the right that you speak of is as basic and fundamental as
that.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Absolutely.
  Senator KENNEDY. And that if we were at another period in our
history we would not be being asked to confirm someone who did
not accept those basic and fundamental fights?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That's right.
                                         395

   Senator KENNEDY. Am I correct in understanding your position?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Yes. In fact, it would be like asking African-
American people in this country to if Brown v. Board were at issue,
to consider that they might have to go back and win their rights
State by State, legislature by legislature, year after year, they
would have to go back and work through all of that to attain their
right to equal education and equal protection. That's what we're
talking about for women. That we're suggesting that women should
go back and win their fundamental rights. Yes, this right should be
considered like any other fundamental right.
   Senator KENNEDY. And, I think all of us are familiar with what
are considered to be special interests. As I understand this is not
like whether you are for gun control or not gun control

   Ms. MICHELMAN. NO, no.

   Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. Single-issue kind of litmus test;
it's really basically and fundamentally from your point of view,
and I think from millions of Americans' point of view that this is
so basic and fundamental as the other established rights?

   Ms. WATTLETON. That's correct.
   Senator KENNEDY. SO, second, as I gather from your testimony, it
would be really inconceivable I imagine that if we were here in the
post-Brown v. Board of Education that we would be considering a
nominee who might go back to the separate but equal doctrine?
   And, as I understand you believe, just so I do understand, that
the decisions that have been made with regards to the rights in the
Roe are about as basic and fundamental as the decisions on the
guarantees and the constitutional protections that were reached
under Brown?
   Ms. MICHELMAN. Absolutely.
   Senator KENNEDY. And other, Marbury v. Madison, and other
major constitutional decisions?
   Ms. MICHELMAN. That is correct.
   Senator KENNEDY. And as we, as a country, would not consider
going back to a separate but equal, you are pressing us to apply a
similar kind of a standard with regards to this particular issue, am
I correct?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think you have said our position very, very
well.
   Senator KENNEDY. I just have a final question. What was your
reaction to the question about, to Judge Souter's comments about
what the world would be like for women if Roe was overturned?
  Ms. WATTLETON. I was truly stunned that the Judge immediately
reduced it to a Federal/State question, and did not react either im-
mediately or in process to the reality of what it would mean which
is that women would suffer the consequences of illegal abortion.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. What he did was he completely missed the
human, the human element here, and moved right to very
  Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. What is the human element?
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. Well, the fact is that a world with-
out Roe would mean death, degradation, shame, injury to women.
It would mean women would be robbed of the most vital, important
right that they have that affects every aspect. You said it, Senator,
it isn't a single issue. This is an issue that literally permeates the
entire fabric of a woman and her family's and the community's
                                      396

life. So it was interesting to me and I share Faye's response, that
he immediately focused very technically on what it would mean
rather than on the huge dimension of social and human problems
that would result.

  Ms. WATTLETON. And I think it reflected our worry about his
general judicial temperament, if I may, with respect to seeing the
impact of the law in people's lives, and seeing the law in a narrow
intellectual context and not in a living context. If there is any in-
spiration that we can gain from constitutional protections it is that
it has been enduring, and that in the context of contemporary life
it has extended protections to greater numbers and segments of
American society.

  So to reduce those protections to the simple equation of whether
there would be tension between Federal and State jurisdictions, or
for that matter, whether illiterate voters would dilute literate
voters as a mathematical problem was very distressing to us.

  Senator KENNEDY. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  Thank you, very much.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Senator.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  How do you do, ladies? Nice to see you today.
  I want both of you to know and I think you are aware of my posi-
tion on this terribly anguishing matter. I think you know that I am
in favor of a woman's right to choose. I have held that view,
formed within 2 years after Roe v. Wade through a legislative
debate.
  I am also very supportive of most of the objectives of Planned
Parenthood. I have stated those things and have provided some of
my own personal funds for dues over the years to some of those
groups.
  But I really believe you are making a big mistake on this one.
That's too bad. You know, it's perfectly all right, but I think these
things are going to come up again. There are going to be other Su-
preme Court choices when you are really going to need to be in the
trenches. This is not one of those cases. This is my view.
  I believe you are seriously in error in demanding that Judge
Souter answer specific questions on this issue, because he is a sit-
ting judge. And since we have heard a remarkable array of ex-
tremely technical discussions over the last few days, which are like
going to law school again, let's not forget Canon 3(a)(6) of the ABA
Code of Judicial Ethics. It prohibits a sitting judge, and that is
Judge Souter, from comment on a "pending or impending matter"
likely to come before the Court. He is prohibited from doing that,
absolutely prohibited under the ethics of the ABA, who have given
him a rating that is the highest they can give.
  Nearly everyone has conceded that abortion will be before the
Supreme Court again, and thus, that subject is covered by the ABA
Code. You are really asking Judge Souter to violate the rule of ju-
dicial ethics in order that your organizations, both of them, can
have advance knowledge of his position on the particular issue of
abortion.
                                      397

  Why are you asking of Judge Souter that which he is forbidden
to answer by the Code of Judicial Conduct?

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, Senator Simpson, I would seriously object
to your characterization of our asking Judge Souter to comment on
the constitutional protection of reproductive privacy for the basis
of our organization's foreknowledge of how he might rule.

  As I spoke earlier in my comments, our views represent the over-
whelming majority of the American people and I sit here, not only
as head of an organization but also as an American, the American
people have a right to know.

  Yes, there are judicial ethics. As a matter of fact, I think that
there is a law that forbids the judge to answer questions about spe-
cific cases, but virtually every aspect of American life at some time
comes into question and must be adjudicated. We believe that this
is an important aspect of American constitutional law that de-
serves to be probed very thoroughly. Perhaps it should be seen as
something that is integrally important to the integrity of women in
this country. We do not consider it an issue that we want to take a
chance on. We may have a difference of opinion, but such is the
democratic process. It is our opinion without a clear understanding
of his judicial philosophy in this area, not how he will rule on Roe
v. Wade, that Mr. Souter should not sit on the Supreme Court.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. I would like to share that. I don't think any
member of this committee asked Judge Souter specific questions
about specific cases, or specific facts that may come before a case,
or may be involved in a case.

  What the attempt was to get at how he would, what kind of legal
reasoning, legal approach he would use to evaluating whether
there is a fundamental constitutional right to privacy. He did, as I
said earlier and as Faye has said, he was more forthcoming in
other areas of law where, in fact, the Court will have to rule in the
future. He singled this one out and we think it is not acceptable
that he should be able to single this out and raises too great a risk.

  Senator SIMPSON. I see. You know, we talked about the issue of
gender discrimination, first amendment free exercise, and those
issues, critical issues. Those are much broader in scope than the
question, do you support a constitutional basis for abortion rights?

  You know that and I know that. Judge Souter was granted lati-
tude on those broader issues, but he simply is not granted this kind
of latitude on this specific issue of abortion.

  Ms. WATTLETON. I might point out that Mr. Souter chose not to
answer the question do you believe that the Constitution protects
the right not to procreate. He declined to answer that after having
established that he believed that it protected marital privacy.

  Senator SIMPSON. I know that. I guess I can only judge that you
wish Judge Souter to advise all political litigants that he is not im-
partial and not using the tools of a judge if he were to hear an
abortion case. I think that is what you are asking him to do.

  Ms. WATTLETON. I believe what we are asking him to do is to
demonstrate his commitment and that he will champion our consti-
tutionally protected rights. Just as I would not want to see him
openminded about whether I have the right to a symbol in this
room today or whether there will be an enshrinement of a particu-
                                      398

lar religious doctrine in the Constitution of the United States,
these constitutional rights must be protected as well.

  Senator SIMPSON. I'm on your side, but I think you're hurting
your cause. If Judge Souter's personal qualifications are not the
single most important issue here, then we're wasting our time and
that was your testimony

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Wait
  Senator SIMPSON [continuing]. Please, I only have 10 minutes.
That is the issue. Are you really saying the only issue in this proc-
ess is whether or not the nominee will do what you want him to do
on one issue? Now, you know, you can talk about single issue all
you want, but that's where we are. I remember the cries and the
shrieks of "unfair, improper crude," and such when the Reagan ad-
ministration was supposedly making the abortion issue a litmus
test in selecting judges during Ronald Reagan's time. I remember
that.
  Family values, you know, was an issue of sinister import at one
time with regard to that. The moral majority and all that stuff
were being hacked to shreds, the litmus test deluxe. Now, you are
asking the committee, this committee, the Senate, to apply that
very test. And you specifically request this, to overlook the person-
al qualifications of this splendid man that you have all seen. The
country knows exactly who he is now, and you ask us to overlook
that, plus his intellect and his knowledge and decide this on a
single issue.
  He did not single this issue out. He did not single this issue out.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. We didn't, by the way, also create the litmus
test. We have lived through 10 years of an administration that has,
indeed, used the judicial appointment process to further a goal of
taking away a fundamental right to choose. In fact, for the first
time in our Nation's history we are on the brink of the Court re-
versing, taking away a fundamental right and I think it is appro-
priate for Judge Souter to talk about that issue. It is not, as we
said, just about legal theory. These are millions of women's lives.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I would like to also say that we have not asked
you to overlook this candidate's qualifications. If a candidate came
before you and said that he or she believed that the Constitution
protected reproductive rights and was otherwise unqualified, that
would not result in our support for that nominee. So I think it is
important not to trivialize the significance of the position that we
are taking here today.
  Just as I doubt that you would confirm this individual if he said
that public education should be separate but equal in this country,
American women do not believe that this individual should be con-
firmed declining to say that he believes that the Constitution pro-
tects our reproductive choices.
  Senator SIMPSON. AS I say, I only know what I read in your state-
ment and I know what it says. We have been impressed by Judge
Souter's intellect and knowledge but Judge Souter's personal quali-
fications are not the issue. That is your quote not mine.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That's my quote.
  Ms. WATTLETON. That's precisely what I've just said.
                                      399
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is not the issue, his personal qualifica-
tions.
  Senator SIMPSON. Fine, but I can say to you that Judge Souter
will be confirmed. It is my thoughtful hope that will happen. He
will be one of nine on the Supreme Court. He will not be the Su-
preme Court. How in the world have we gotten into this situation
where on each case suddenly this is supposedly the key person?
Even if he should be, I don't know where he is on the issue, but I
know he has done the absolutely right thing in answering with
regard to it that even if he should be antiabortion--I hope he is
not, as you seem to be so sure he is. I don't understand how you got
to that point. But even the overruling of Roe y. Wade will never
prohibit abortion. It will come up again and again and again and it
will come up in the States. It will never be put away ever, ever be
put away.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Oh, Senator
  Senator SIMPSON. Just a moment, please. The issue is going to
come up for ever and ever and ever. I hope it will be done in the
Supreme Court and I hope it will be done correctly so that women
will have that choice.
  But you talk about the majority of Americans who support the
woman's right to choose and I'm one of those. So why this great
inordinate fear of a single nominee to the Supreme Court who you
really don't know where he stands on the issue? What is the basis
of that inordinate, obsessive fear?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Because the Court is on the brink, for the first
time in history, of taking away an established, fundamental right.
And that has been accomplished year after year by administrations
committed to using the judicial appointment process to attain that
goal. That's how we got Scalia, and we have O'Connor, Kennedy.
That is why we are understandably a trifle nervous about Judge
Souter.
  He has said nothing in his testimony to convince us that he, in
fact, recognizes a constitutional right to privacy. Senator, I must
comment, I can't let go your comment, well, if Roe is overturned
women will have the right to choose. You know what it was like
before 1973, some women died because in one State abortion was
illegal.
  Women shouldn't have to win their rights or their rights
shouldn't be dependent upon their place of residence any more
than an African-American should have equal protection based on
his or her place of residence.
  I don't think we can trivialize this issue that way and that is
why we have taken this strong statement. The last thing I want to
say is this is politically not an easy thing to do. As I said also in
my statement, that the politics are difficult but the principle is
what counts here.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Senator Simpson, I would also like to say that
the reason that we are deeply concerned about this is because we
believe in the concept of the Bill of Rights that separates and takes
apart from certain political processes, certain basic rights that
Americans enjoy and can expect to enjoy as Americans. While you
may say that if Roe v. Wade is overturned it has very little
effect
                                               400

  Senator SIMPSON. I don't know whether that will happen.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Or that, for that matter, it will turn back to the
States as the representative of an organization that provides serv-
ices to millions of women each year, we know the practical applica-
tion of that, the poor and the young.
  That most often means minority women will be the first to be
injured and the first to die and that is not what we want to see.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know, but you see you have effectively divert-
ed it again and again and again. We are back to the issue of a man
that you have watched and heard. A man who is bright, intelligent,
studious, caring, chivalrous, patient, probative, civilized, and a
great listener and if that ain't enough for you, I think you are
making a real mistake.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I think we have a difference of opinion and we
believe in the process.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think that is clear, you do have a difference of
opinion. [Laughter.]
  Ms. MICHELMAN. We do have a difference of opinion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you one question, because I did not
understand one thing you said. Had Judge Souter said, "I believe
that the right to determine whether or not to remain pregnant is a
fundamental right of privacy," even though that would not have
told you how he would rule on any case relating to abortion, be-
cause it would not tell you what burden of proof he would think is
necessary to interpose the State's will between an individual's exer-
cise of that right and the State's requirement that they put up, if
he had merely said it is a fundamental right that continues after
pregnancy, would you be here this morning?
  Ms. WATTLETON. If he had said that it was a fundamental right
that continued throughout procreation and throughout pregnancy,
he would have said that the State must show--in essence, he would
have been affirming Roe, which is to say that the State must show
a compelling interest in order for it to be a fundamental right to
intercede and to prevent the exercise of that right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not asking you what it means. I am asking
you whether or not you would be here.
  Ms. WATTLETON. That is the way we interpret it.
  Me. Michelman. Probably not.
  Ms. WATTLETON. We probably would not be.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. I thank you.
  Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  You equate the Brown v. Board of Education cases with the issue
and the problem that your organizations and those you represent
face and it seems to me there is no reconsidering of Brown v.
Board of Education before us or the Court. There are no organiza-
tions that I know of, there is no split in society of any significant
numbers, where there is a great split in our society regarding re-
productive rights and the right to choose.
  I think you would agree that there is as tremendous split in our
society as it relates to your position versus the right to life?
  Ms. WATTLETON. There is virtually little disagreement, and that
is not to say there is no disagreement, on the question of whether
the Government should be the one to decide or to intervene. There
                                         401

is broad consensus that the Government should stay out of it, re-
gardless of the individuals' moral views on abortion.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU do not quite answer my question, or
maybe I do not quite make it clear. Do you agree that there is a
great number of people, including women, who take a different po-
sition than your organizations on the issue of Roe v. Wade and, spe-
cifically, abortion?

   Ms. MICHELMAN. The majority of Americans
   Senator DECONCINI. I am not talking about the majority, I am
saying there are a number of Americans who disagree with your
position on this issue.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. There are people who differ on the moral ques-
tions about abortion, but
   Senator DECONCINI. Right.
   Ms. WATTLETON. In fact, there is
   Ms. MICHELMAN. But as they said, the question before the Court
in 1973 was who should decide, and the majority of Americans
agreed with the Court that it should be the individual who decides,
so there is a difference in the moral aspects

   Senator DECONCINI. But as you
   Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. But there is not much of a differ-
ence in--there is great support.
   Senator DECONCINI. AS you have indicated, if a moral position is
a principle, you ought not sacrifice that principle, and many in this
country believe that there is a principle regarding the life that is
there. In the judgment of some of us that decision should be left to
the individual--and I understand that you may disagree with that,
and rightfully so.

   Ms. WATTLETON. TO the individual.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. TO the individual, that's right.
   Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. To make that determina-
tion
   Ms. MICHELMAN. That is right.
   Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Where many of us do not be-
lieve that is a proper decision to be left to someone, because of the
fact of the moral principle that life is there.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, the Government should no more, be able
to compel a woman to have an abortion than governments should
be able to compel a woman to continue a pregnancy against her
will. It is just not a realm for the State, for politicians, for Govern-
ment, and that is what the issue was in 1973.

   Senator DECONCINI. Why do you think, then, that there were
48

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, the reason that we
  Senator DECONCINI. Wait, just a minute.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I am sorry.
  Senator DECONCINI. Why do you think there were 48 or 49 votes
for a constitutional amendment to reverse Roe v. Wade on the
Senate floor? Although not enough to pass an amendment, close to
a majority felt Roe v. Wade should be reversed. It seems to me that
there is a great distinction here regarding this issue before the
Court, the abortion order. Roe v. Wade, than there is between
Brown v. Board of Education. I do not see any amendments to re-
                                              402

verse Brown v. Board of Education or any movement in society
that differs with that longstanding decision.

  My point is that we have a tremendous split, and you have nar-
rowed it down to who may tell the woman whether or not she may
or may not make a choice; I have narrowed it down to the moral
decision of life. That is your right and I think that is my right to
look at it.

  So, my point is, it seems to me proper that the Court would con-
sider and continue to consider this issue, when there is a great di-
vergency in our society as to the moral issue or as to the issue that
you point out as to who, if anyone, should restrict a woman's right.

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, the Court in 1973 pointed out the moral
diversity in our society, and it was for that reason it felt that it
should be left to the individual to decide. We think that was prop-
erly decided

  Senator DECONCINI. I understand.
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. And that it continues to be proper-
ly decided. That is not to say that when we have established rights,
that there will not be continuing public debate or, for that matter,
political debate, although we think that is inappropriate, and that
is what we are arguing here today.
  Senator DECONCINI. I understand.
  Ms. WATTLETON. NOW, the comment with respect to why there
may have been so many votes in the Senate with respect to a con-
stitutional amendment, I think that was a very different time and
I think that there were many politicians and Senators who were
very concerned about the politics of the issue, not that they may
have felt that it was right to, in fact, support a constitutional
amendment.
  So, while I respectfully submit that we can acknowledge your
view on this, Senator, we also recognize, and I think we all have an
obligation in public life to recognize, that there is wide-ranging di-
versity on this from a religious perspective, from a moral perspec-
tive, from an economic perspective, that really simply cannot be re-
solved in the political process
  Senator DECONCINI. Well, that may be
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. And that is why we believe that the
Court's wisdom to remove it from that process was correct.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU may be correct that you cannot resolve
it, but the politics is not going to end attempting to resolve it, in
my opinion, neither the political process nor the judicial process is
going to end, because of that difference of moral conviction or legal
conviction or personal conviction, whatever you care to call it. It is
going to continue, which gets me to the point of why Judge Souter
would make such a statement regarding racial discrimination as it
relates to school and the Brown case, and would not want to at
least satisfy you in the area of abortion, even though you said he
did not have to state his position on Roe v. Wade. It seems to me
quite a distinction, and it is foolish for us not to think and under-
stand that this is going to continue for a long time.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. But, Senator, we are really concerned about the
principles that underlie Brown and the principles that underlie
Roe v. Wade and the whole area of privacy, that we were concerned
to hear Judge Souter discuss, and he refused, after I thought very
                                                    403

thoughtful questioning by Senators Biden and Kennedy and Metz-
enbaum and Simon and others, he refused to discuss that area. It is
the principles that we are concerned about

   Senator DECONCINI. And my point
   Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. And I think it is appropriate, with-
out getting into how he would rule on a specific case before the
Court, to discuss the principles involved, and I
   Senator DECONCINI. I heard him a little differently, he did dis-
cuss the principles, but he did not go far enough for you to be com-
fortable that he would satisfy your position. That is how I heard it.
   Quite frankly, as someone who differs with you on that view, on
that principle, it seems to me that he left an impression here that
his mind was not made up. I do not think he sat there under oath
and would deliberately lie to us, if his mind was made up.
Second

   Ms. WATTLETON. But I

   Ms. MICHELMAN. But the point
   Senator DECONCINI. Excuse me, and then I will let you respond.
Second, he left me with the impression that he is very cognizant of
the importance of the decision, as well as its history. He also recog-
nizes what the law was, by virtue of his experience sitting on a hos-
pital board. He did not indicate his personal view, but he showed a
willingness to stand by the law. This leaves me with some impres-
sion that his experience is going to be part of his thinking process.
   If you do not get Souter from this President, who, since he has
been Vice President, I might add, has taken a very different view
on the issue of reproductive right to choose, who better can you
get?
   I find that this man is quite qualified and quite open, more open,
quite frankly, than Scalia, based on what I knew about Scalia--but
for other reasons we did not go into Scalia--and certainly different
than Judge Bork.
   Mr. WATTLETON. What Mr. Souter did not say troubles us, as
much as what he said, Senator, and the fact that he was prepared
to comment on the morality of the death penalty and white collar
crime, and not prepared to comment even on whether the Constitu-
tion protected the right not to procreate was eminently disturbing.
   We were not comforted by his vote on the hospital board, because
he made it clear that his vote emanated from his recognition that
abortion was the law of the land and, as such, the hospital, as a
provider of services to the community, should permit its facilities
to be used for abortions.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, I understand that distinction. The
only
  Ms. WATTLETON. That in no way, in the face of declining to com-
ment on whether he felt the Constitution extended to the protec-
tion not to procreate comforted us.
  I think that it also, from our view, is analogous to--there are
some parallels that can be drawn between this issue and other
questions that may or may not come before the Court.
  Senator DECONCINI. Including Brown v. Board of Education?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Racial discrimination is very much still before
the Court, on many issues, on many aspects. Certainly, the Grove
City
                                                    404

   Senator DECONCINI. Certainly not school discrimination or inte-
gration

   Ms. WATTLETON. School discrimination in the form of busing
   Senator DECONCINI. School integration, excuse me.
   Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. In the form of busing is a question,
I know, because I have a personal family member who is integrally
involved, and desegregation and implementation even to this point.
   Senator DECONCINI. YOU think school integration is still an issue,
in this country
   Mr. WATTLETON. I think that school integration is still an issue.
   Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Whether or not separate but
equal is still before us?
   Mr. WATTLETON. I think that there is no question that it is still
an issue in this country.
   Senator DECONCINI. I disagree with you.
   Ms. WATTLETON. It may not be expressed in the direct ways that
perhaps we saw before the end of Jim Crowe laws, but it is still a
major issue in this country.

   Senator DECONCINI. DO you know any organizations that pro-
mote separate but equal schools today, or any resolutions that have
been introduced in the Congress

   Ms. WATTLETON. We have a State legislator who is running for
this great august body who promotes such an ideal.

   Senator DECONCINI. And do you think he has a great following
behind him, that he is

   Ms. WATTLETON. He has managed to get himself elected to a
State legislature, and I think that it does not matter whether he
has as great following or not.

   Senator DECONCINI. YOU think
   Ms. WATTLETON. We do not have a great following in this coun-
try to end legal abortion, but still it is a matter of the political
process that we must be concerned and worried about
   Senator DECONCINI. SO, you think
   Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. That a narrow minority can, in
fact, wreak tyranny on the majority.
   Senator DECONCINI. DO you think Mr. Duke in Louisiana symbol-
izes a great movement similar to the right to life movement and
those that disagree with your position on abortion, do you think
there is a great similarity there?
   Ms. WATTLETON. The point that I made was that I believe that a
small group of people or a small segment of our society can, in fact,
have an impact on the process and that the segment of our society
who would like to see legal abortion become, once again, illegal is
such a small segment. It is not the great majority of the American
people who want to see that.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. Senator, I would agree with you, that the ma-
jority of Americans absolutely--a majority, I would say, you know,
Americans are committed to the principle of equal education. I
mean there are some like David Duke.
  Senator DECONCINI. I think so, too.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. What we are saying is that Roe v. Wade and
the principles involved in Roe, the dignity, the integrity of the
right of the individual to make this very personal and important
                                                    405

decision should be as well accepted in area of law as Brown v.
Board of Education.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, that is
  Ms. MICHELMAN. And if there were any question about Judge
Souter's views in Brown, I think, without giving us assurances, he
would have much more difficulty being confirmed and that is what
we
  Senator DECONCINI. I guess that is where I disagree with you, I
think there is a great distinction here, because, quite frankly, I
think the majority of Americans, are opposed to abortion, even
though the polls show that a majority feel that choice should be
left to the individual. So, to me you have a great weight of author-
ity and great following here in opposition to the moral issue,
maybe not the Roe v. Wade decision in and of itself, far different
than Brown v. Board of Education, but that may be just a differ-
ence of opinion.
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
   The Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Thank you, both of you, for being good witnesses and for your
testimony. I have a different view than you do and I hope you can
respect my view, as I respect your view.
   Let me start by saying that I have no more insight into this ques-
tion I am going to ask you than anyone else. I am worried, too, but
for different reasons, as you can imagine.
   What if the nominee, Mr. Souter, would have said that he
thought that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, but that he would
uphold it, as a matter of precedent, as a matter of settled law?
Would that have been good enough for you and your organization?
   Ms. MICHELMAN. It certainly would have been a much stronger
statement and it would have reassured us more than we have now.
If he categorically made the statement that he would uphold Roe v.
Wade, we would feel much differently about his position on the
Court.
   Senator GRASSLEY. What is the history of both of your organiza-
tions, when it comes to Supreme Court nominees? I do not know
the answer to this, either, but my supposition, I have a supposi-
tion--has either of the groups you represent ever supported a
nominee to the Supreme Court?
   Ms. WATTLETON. We have not actively supported a nominee to
the Supreme Court. This is the second or, I should say, the third
nominee that we have opposed.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. We have--I think we have in the past, but I
have not been with NARAL more than 5 years. We have been con-
cerned over the last 10 years with an administration's deliberate
use of the judicial process, judicial appointment process to explicit-
ly reach the goal of overturning this right, of taking away this
right, so we have been very careful in scrutinizing the nominees to
come before the Court in the last 10 years.
   Senator GRASSLEY. SO, in the case of Kennedy, Scalia, O'Connor,
Rehnquist, you did not support them. Do you

          39-454--91 14
                                                    406

   Ms. MICHELMAN. We did not take a position on Justice Kennedy.
I am not sure that I would say that was the best decision NARAL
ever made, given what we know about Justice Kennedy right now.

   Ms. WATTLETON. We opposed his confirmation, but did not launch
an active campaign against him.

   Senator GRASSLEY. DO either of you remember whether your or-
ganizations supported Judge Stevens in 1976, when he was
before

   Ms. MICHELMAN. I do not remember.
   Ms. WATTLETON. I was not head of Planned Parenthood.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. The issue of Roe v. Wade is a national issue and
certainly on our minds. In the future, the question of whether it
will or will not be reversed will bring into consideration two major
elements for the Court to look at. One is the issue of prochoice/
prolife, and the other issue is stare decisis, the precedent which
Senator Grassley referred to. There may be other elements that
would enter into it.
  Would you give us your evaluation of what you have read and
heard relative to Judge Souter's writings and statements pertain-
ing to stare decisis?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, before I get to that point, Senator, I
would just like to say that the issue really is not prolife/prochoice,
it is who decides, it is who decides what is the right thing to do, the
individual or the State.
  As far as stare decisis, he did not indicate how he would rule,
how he would use the issue of precedent as it relates to Roe v.
Wade. He did not discuss
  Senator HEFLIN. He spoke generally pertaining to
  Ms. MICHELMAN. He spoke generally.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, give us your evaluation of his general
statements and writings relative to stare decisis.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, his general statement, he said that he has
respect for precedent.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I believe in his statement he also said that stare
decisis was but one element that should be considered
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Right.
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. In whether the earlier decision had
been right or wrong in its impact on the American or the people
and that he would evaluate what impact it would have on the
people, before making a decision to overturn it.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. And he also went further in the area of privacy,
to say that this whole area is open for reevaluation and, in fact, it
would be years before it would be settled. So, there is a mixed
review on the precedent view, his view of precedent as it relates to
Roe v. Wade.
  Senator HEFLIN. That is all. Those are all the questions I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would start with the very basic question as to whether you
think that President Bush will submit a nomination more to your
                                               407

liking. He has taken a position of prolife, against abortion. He has
submitted a nominee who leaves the question open. The evidence is
compelling, if not conclusive, that President Bush did not look for a
litmus test. Do you think that it is realistic, if we turn down Judge
Souter, to find President Bush submitting to the Senate who will
give you a flat commitment to uphold Roe v. Wade?

  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, I hope that President Bush will, in future
nominees or nominations, rather, recognize that he was elected by
the American people, that his personal views on these questions
are those, his private views. And we have every hope to believe
that this nominee and future nominees will uphold the protections
of the Constitution and to suggest that the President would make a
nomination of someone who believes that our constitutional protec-
tions should be eroded seems to me to be a very troubling develop-
ment in the direction that this country might take.

  I have come of age in a period of time in which the Court has
made it possible for me to realize the American dream, as a
member of a minority race, as a woman, as a poor child growing up
in this country, and so I understand the meaning in a very person-
al way of the enlargement and enfranchisement of groups of people
in this country. And to disenfranchise women and for a nominee
not to make clear his position with respect to the enfranchisement
of women in this country is indeed a very disturbing development.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think, Senator, President Bush is part of the
legacy that I was talking about, the 10-year legacy of using the ju-
dicial process--in fact, he ran on a platform very strongly commit-
ted to using this process to take away this right, and he never re-
pudiated that when he made this nomination.

  I think it is possible for President Bush to say that he is not
standing on his platform commitment and that he is not submit-
ting a nomination that is not litmus tested and the litmus test was
generated by the Reagan-Bush administration, not by us. I think it
is possible, and we cannot allow our views about this important
right to go undicussed, because we might think we might get some-
one worse, as everyone keeps saying. The issue is what is before us
now and what is at stake in this.

  Senator SPECTER. Those are very interesting comments, but they
do not answer my question. I am very sympathetic, Ms. Wattleton,
to everything you say about women's rights and about the rights of
Afro-Americans.

  And as I listen to you, Ms. Michelman, I hear the word "hope," I
hear the word "litmus test," but it is totally unrealistic to expect
President Bush, on this state of the record, to submit to the Senate
a nominee who is committed to reverse Roe v. Wade. That would
just fly in the face of everything that President Bush has said and
done.

  In submitting a nominee like Judge Souter, where the judge has
stated that he was not asked the question, and there is no evidence
that he was asked the question, and he has withstood repeated
questioning and has come here with an open mind and not taken a
position, I just think it is not realistic to expect that, if Judge
Souter is turned down, we will find a nominee who will pass your
test that is a commitment to uphold Roe v. Wade.
                                                    408

   Ms. WATTLETON. Well, you may think it is unrealistic. The
answer to your question is would we expect that, and the answer
was--the question was would we expect it, and the answer is that,
yes, we do expect a nominee to the Supreme Court to uphold our
constitutional protections in procreative matters.

   Senator SPECTER. MS. Wattleton, that is too high a level of gener-
alization. When you come down to saying you expect President
Bush to submit a nominee who will commit in advance to uphold-
ing Roe v. Wade, I for one just have to say that is not realistic.

   Mr. WATTLETON. But, Senator Specter, I think it was realistic for
this committee to ask Mr. Souter whether he believed that the
Constitution extended to the protection of individuals or women
not to be pregnant. I think that this is a question that was not
asked by us, but by this committee, and that particular candidate
or Judge Souter chose not to answer that question, and so that is
the reason that we are here before you today, because we think
that implicit in that question is the question of whether there are
constitutional protections for the use of contraception, as well as
the constitutional protections to terminate an unwanted
pregnancy.

  Senator SPECTER. When you testify that there is not a great fol-
lowing in this country to end legal abortion, my own sense is that
Senator DeConcini has raised a very good point when he says--I
think in his terms, and I do not necessarily agree with his charac-
terization--that a majority of Americans are against abortion, but
it is a complex question.

  The polls come out in favor of a right to choose, if there is an
absolute prohibition that anyone can choose under any circum-
stance, the right to life of the mother or the incest or the rape
questions, and then you have the further gradation about the right
to choose over the husband's objection.

  Many people think women ought to have the right to choose, but
you say, well, suppose they have been married 15 years and it is
the first pregnancy and the husband objects, and then you get to a
15-year-old girl living at home and the question of whether her par-
ents have input. When you get down to these levels, there are
many gradations as to what public opinion says on this question.

  As I think both of you women know, I have supported choice and
have supported public funding, because I do not think that there is
any way for government to get into this complex question. I do not
like abortion, but if the Government is going to try to put a road
map on this, it is just impossible to do, with all of the variations, so
I have taken the position that I have.

  But coming from a State which has passed a very restrictive
abortion law and facing large groups of prolife constituents of mine
every January 23, and going to Pennsylvania's 67 counties, it is a
dominant issue. An interest against abortion--I have told Ms. Mi-
chelman, when she asked for a chance to talk with me, and we did
not get together, Ms. Wattleton--but the people on your side are
not nearly as active politically, not that that is the end-all, but we
have a responsibility above and beyond those whom we hear from.

  But there are other very vital issues here. The right to die issue
is one comparable to the right of a woman to choose. Senator Hum-
phrey is not here and maybe he will come, but he would talk about
                                         409

the right of the fetus, potential life. He would not say potential, he
would call it a life in being, but I would say the right of a fetus or
potential life. If you think that our constituents are on your side, I
think you misjudge the tone of the people.

  Senator Kennedy gave a statement about separation of church
and state, while Judge Souter did not make a statement on the sep-
aration of church and state that Jefferson talked about or that Jus-
tice Black talked about. Should I vote against Judge Souter because
I didn't get a flat assurance on that important issue?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, Senator, I would like to speak to your
characterization of the polls. First of all

  Senator SPECTER. Well, do that after you answer
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. I think you should vote against
   Senator SPECTER [continuing]. The pending question, if you
would.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think you should vote against Judge Souter
because he has not established a recognition of this fundamental
right to privacy to include the right to choose. That is my first
answer. I think you would be in good conscience in voting against
him because so much is at stake. The American public does have
differing views on which circumstances personally they think are
acceptable for having abortions, but they don't differ largely on
who should make that decision. The majority of people do believe
that Government cannot answer these questions, and they are also
feeling very strongly, mind you, that this Government does not do
nearly enough to help to reduce the need for abortion by advancing
a very aggressive prevention program in this country. That is
where the American public believes the effort around reducing the
need for abortion should be, not in the area of taking away the
right of a woman to decide once she faces a crisis pregnancy. But I
think you would be absolutely right in withholding your consent to
this nominee based on what is at stake in this process.

   Senator SPECTER. MS. Wattleton, may I ask you a question?
   Ms. WATTLETON. Sure.
   Senator SPECTER. This may seem arcane, the jurisdiction of the
Court, but I think the most fundamental right that we talked
about in this country on a nominee is the right of judicial review.
If you don't have judicial review, you can't get Roe v. Wade. Judge
Souter did not satisfy me when I asked him about the authority of
Congress to take away the power of the Court to decide first
amendment issues. If the Court doesn't have the power to decide a
woman's constitutional right, then there can be no constitutional
right.

   Do you think it appropriate for me to vote against him--I am
asking you, Ms. Wattleton--because he didn't answer the question
as to Court jurisdiction to my satisfaction?

  Ms. WATTLETON. I believe that if you have satisfied in your mind
that this is not a candidate who will uphold the Constitution of the
United States and the protections therein, then you should vote
against him.

   I might point out that I believe that one of the reasons that you
are feeling the political churning around the abortion issue is be-
cause the Court, as it is now composed, has created an enormous
potential for political turmoil on this issue by undermining Roe in
                                          410

the Webster decision. When it upheld the Missouri law that granted
State restrictions on abortion, that undermined the earlier rulings
on Roe and its progeny.

   So I think that, yes, it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in
1990 once again debating this issue politically, something that is
settled in the minds of the American people but now is politically
in a state of upheaval again.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, my time is up, so I would like to conclude
with this very brief comment. I understand your position, but the
focus is very much on a single issue. I did not have an opportunity
to ask you if you would vote against a Senator on a single issue. As
a person who has to decide a lot of questions, I very strongly feel
that a Senator ought to be judged on his entire record.

  When I asked Ms. Michelman the question about should I vote
against Judge Souter because he doesn't satisfy me on the separa-
tion, the wall, between church and state, I didn't get an answer to
that. It comes right back to the abortion issue. When I asked Ms.
Wattleton if I should vote against Judge Souter because he doesn't
satisfy me on the vital issue of judicial review, I get a generalized
answer that if he doesn't uphold constitutional rights I should vote
against him and we come back to the abortion issue.

  The abortion issue is a very, very vital one, but it is one issue of
many which are before the Court and have to be considered by the
Senate. I do not have a fixed opinion on Judge Souter at this point,
and I am very interested in your testimony. But I do have to say to
you that as sympathetic as I have been, there is a big constituency
out there opposed flatly to your point of view, which has to be
weighed politically, although I voted, as I have said, prochoice be-
cause I don't think Government can deal with this issue. But there
is much more in America besides any one issue, however important
any one issue may be.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Let me conclude with a comment and a question. I may or may
not agree with your final recommendation. For me it rests upon
my reading, literally rereading--I don't say that lightly. We some-
times hear Senators say I am going to go back and reread the
record, and you look at them like--the press just smiled and every-
body went, yes, they understand that one. But literally I will
reread the record in about 15 to 18 places that I think are key in
helping me determine whether or not Judge Souter's assertions
recognize a right to privacy in this area.
  Now, let me make sure. I am going to characterize your position
as I have heard it here today, and I want you to correct me if I am
wrong rather than take the time to go back and ask you a number
of probative questions and try to get all the pieces of this. I don't
expect you to agree with me if I in any way misrepresent what I
understand to be your position.
  It seems to me that what you are saying here today is that your
opposition to Judge Souter is grounded on his unwillingness to ac-
knowledge the existence of a fundamental right to privacy relating
to a woman's decision whether or not to remain pregnant. His fail-
ure to recognize that as a fundamental right, you are arguing, puts
him in a category and the issue in a category totally different than
                                         411

as it was characterized by the Senator from Pennsylvania and
others.

  On the separation of church and State issues, it is a matter of
degree. No one is arguing, no one has put forward the proposition,
no one has suggested that the first amendment--either in the es-
tablishment clause or the free exercise clause--does not set up a
dilemma on the one hand, and the exercise of the existence of a
fundamental right State action on the other hand. It is a funda-
mental right. The first part of the equation is clearly set out in the
Constitution. There is a fundamental right against establishment,
if you will, and for the free exercise. The only issue is what degree
of evidence, of rationale, of proof, does the State have to show in
order to interfere with that fundamental right.

  The right of procreation, the decision to procreate is a fundamen-
tal right. There is no debate about that. The only debate is whether
or not and under what circumstances the State can interfere with
that fundamental right. The right of assembly is a fundamental
right. The only question is how much evidence the State has to
bring forward to interfere with that fundamental right. The right
of association is an unenumerated fundamental right. No one
argues about it. The only debate is gradation. How much proof or
evidence or rationale has to be put forward to interfere with that
right of association?

  A parent's right to determine the education of their child is a
fundamental right, going back to Pierce, and the only question is
how much evidence the State, how much proof the State, how
much rationale the State, has to bring forward to interfere with
that fundamental right.

  The right of an African-American to go to school anywhere they
want to go is a fundamental right. Arguably, theoretically, like all
fundamental rights, it could be overruled by, it could be interfered
with by, some State rationale that no one has ever thought of and
no one is ever going to be able to think of. But theoretically there
is no fundamental right that is absolute in the Constitution. Free
speech is a fundamental right, but the State can say we are going
to interfere with that fundamental right if you are yelling "Fire"
in a crowded movie theater. We can interfere with that fundamen-
tal right.

  Now, what you are saying, as I understand it, is that you would
insist from your perspective that the nominee say this is a funda-
mental right--like the right to travel, unenumerated; like the right
of parents to determine the education of their child, unenumerat-
ed; like the right of procreation, the decision to procreate--that
what you wanted him to say was that is fundamental.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. And notwithstanding what all my colleagues
have said here, none of it makes much sense, with all due respect,
because all the examples they have used have been examples about
the second part of the equation, which is how much proof, how
much evidence, how much rationale, the degree of the rationale re-
quired to interfere with these rights. That is what the debate is. It
is over on this side on all the issues my colleagues have mentioned.
                                      412
   And what you are saying is, hey, look, gentlemen, we want you
to prove to us, we think you have a minimum obligation to say we
are positive this guy knows this is a fundamental right.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. We are not asking you to say, Chairman Biden,
we are not asking you to say, Senator Specter, we are not asking
you to say, Senator DeConcini, that you can then guarantee us how
he is likely to rule on the requirement of parental consent, all the
gradations. Am I correct?
  Ms. WATTLETON. That is correct, and our deep concern was his
reticence to respond to this with respect to the Court evaluating
this on the basis of compelling State interest as opposed to undue
burden.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me tell you, in conclusion, where I may
disagree with you. It is not in the burden you think the nominee
must carry, which in my view is a legitimate request. For none of
us would be sitting here if he said, "I don't think the right of asso-
ciation is a fundamentally guaranteed right," and say, "OK, Judge,
you are a wonderful guy, we like you, and we think you are bril-
liant, and it has been a tour de force, and, therefore, even though
we disagree on that little one, we are going to go ahead and vote
for you." None of us would sit here, I suspect, and say, "Judge, you
don't think it is a fundamental right for people to travel. But not-
withstanding that little problem, we are still going to go ahead and
vote for you."
  So I think you are right in asking about that fundamental right.
My dilemma relative to this Justice is as follows--and I know both
of you, and you are both very bright women obviously, very com-
pelling, but also very practical. The politics of the situation are this
man was between a rock and a hard spot. If he said there was a
fundamental right, he would satisfy Biden, and Grassley would go
in orbit. If he said there wasn't a fundamental right, he would sat-
isfy Grassley, and Biden would go in orbit. And he would guaran-
tee that a nomination that might not be in trouble would surely be
in trouble, from one side or the other.
  And there is some rationale, it seems to me, for him to avoid
that political briar patch. But I am not sure I read his state-
ments--many that were in response to questions from me in par-
ticular because, obviously, I was focusing on this issue--I want to
know what he said to me--as well as to others, the way you read it.
And that is that he does not recognize the fundamental right.
  It seems to me there is almost equally compelling evidence to
conclude that he believes there is a fundamental right, but that is
a decision I am going to have to make based on the record. I just
want to get it clear here; that had he said--this is important be-
cause we are going to be at this exercise, I am afraid, God willing,
all of our collective health prevailing, we are going to be at this
exercise probably several more times in the near term.
  I do not believe--and this is my concluding question. I do not be-
lieve that the nominee should have to answer how he would rule
on Roe. I do not believe he should have to do that because I think
that sets a precedent that may very well come back and bite every-
thing I believe in, even though I would like to know how he would
rule on Roe. Quite frankly, I am not sure what it would tell us
                                         413

even if he told us he would sustain Roe. He might sustain Roe and
vote for Webster. He might sustain Roe and say, yes, you can have
an abortion in any facility that doesn't have hallways 14 feet wide.
He might sustain Roe and say--you know, and so on. So I don't
think it would tell us much.

  My question to you is: The next nominee, are you going to insist
that that nominee say anything beyond whether or not they regard
the right of a woman to make a judgment with regard to the termi-
nation of a pregnancy as fundamental, a fundamental right? Are
you going to ask anything beyond that? Are you going to insist that
that nominee tell you how they would rule on Roe, on Webster, and
on God knows how many other cases may have come between the
time of the last case and the case that may be in question for that
nominee? Do you want a specific answer to a specific case ruling?

  Ms. WATTLETON. I believe that we are as mindful of the codes
and the law as you are here today. We have not in this proceeding
nor would we in the future insist upon such an assurance, although
parenthetically I might point out that a variety of cases have come
up in this discussion and this process. And if we look back at Jus-
tice Rehnquist's proceedings, he discussed it and has not recused
himself in subsequent cases.

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, let me interrupt you there for a
moment. I think Senator Simpson, God bless him, notwithstanding
reading the Canons of Ethics, if he applied the Canons of Ethics to
what was said here, clearly the judge had breached them because
he went out of his way and he answered very specifically in a
whole number of areas. I am not asking you on technical grounds
because of the Canon.

   Ms. WATTLETON. Yes, that is parenthetical.
   The CHAIRMAN. SO please try not to be a lawyer's lawyer with
me, even though you are not a lawyer.

   Ms. WATTLETON. NO, I am not.

   The CHAIRMAN. But you know a lot more than most lawyers that
I know.

   Ms. WATTLETON. I have studied very faithfully at the feet of
many wonderful lawyers.

   The CHAIRMAN. But, tell me, are you going to ask
   Ms. WATTLETON. But the point that I made, before I added the
parentheses, was that we did not ask you to ask such a question in
this proceeding, and we would not at future proceedings. I believe
that the question that you asked and did not get an answer is an
appropriate question to ask, and that is whether the Constitution
protects the right not to be pregnant.
   Ms. MICHELMAN. And you did not get an answer, and I think
that is the question. And I agree, we should not expect the nomi-
nee to talk about specific cases. And I do hope, Senator, as you are
reading the testimony, that we remember it isn't just about legal
theory. This is about real women's and real Americans' lives. This
is a fundamental right that is about to be overturned.
   The CHAIRMAN. Well, you have never asked me--as a matter of
fact, I didn't speak with you prior to this hearing--about any of
this, nor do I know that you have asked any other member of the
committee to ask. This is one of our opportunities to find out why
you--not why you feel the way you do. It is clear why. But to find
                                          414

out what burden of proof must be met in order for you to be willing
to take a chance. And no matter what is said, ultimately all of
America is doing nothing more than taking a chance because we
are putting on the bench, at some point in this process, someone
who could be there for decades, deciding the fate of Americans in a
whole range of areas. And as one of my colleagues said earlier, why
one man? Well, the reason one man or one woman will make a dif-
ference now is that one vote will decide almost a half a dozen criti-
cal issues. One vote. That is why it is so important.

   I appreciate your testimony, and I hope I didn't in any way mis-
state it. But I think this issue is so complicated--the issue of the
fundamental distinction between an ordinary and a fundamental
right and the burden of proof that raises for the State. That is all a
lot of legal gobbledygook.

   Ms. MICHELMAN. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you both very, very much for your testi-
mony and for being so clear in stating how you felt about this
issue.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Thank you for having us.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Our next panel is a panel of very distinguished
Americans who are here to testify on behalf of the nominee: Hon.
Griffin Bell, former Attorney General of the United States; Hon.
Slade Gorton, the distinguished Senator from the State of Washing-
ton, who has served more than a decade as attorney general of the
State of Washington; Hon. Gerald Baliles, former Governor and
former attorney general of the State of Virginia; and Hon. Jerome
Diamond, former attorney general for Judge Souter's neighboring
State of Vermont.

  The committee welcomes you. Senator Gorton is over on the
floor. He is on is way. Mr. Diamond is not just on his way, he is
here.

  Welcome, gentlemen. Let me say for the record, I was asked to
point out that Senator Simon wanted very much to ask questions of
the last panel and this panel, but he, too, is involved with the legis-
lation that is on the floor of the Senate at this moment. That is
why he was unable to be here to ask the questions.

  Gentlemen, it is good to see you. Good to see you, General Bell. It
seems the only time I see you these days is when there is a nomi-
nee. But it is good to see you here, and I must tell you I long for
the days when you were appointing nominees to the bench. Maybe
some day in the next century we may have the chance to do that
again.

  I shouldn't say it that way because last time I used a phrase
"Justice Souter," and all the papers said "Biden declares the
matter over." I am only kidding. I believe it may well be before the
year 2000 that we have a Democratic President. I shouldn't say
that. I am only joking. I should stop joking. I am getting myself
further in trouble, and that old adage, "When in a hole, stop dig-
ging." So I will stop.

  Mr. BELL. YOU can't lose your sense of humor, though.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is a necessary requirement.
  Unless you gentlemen have another way in which to proceed, I
would like to suggest that we begin in the order in which the wit-
                                         415

nesses were called, if that is appropriate, if no one objects. That
means if you would be willing to begin, General Bell, I would ap-
preciate it very much.

PANEL CONSISTING OF HON. GRIFFIN BELL, FORMER ATTORNEY
  GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES; HON. SLADE GORTON, A U.S.
  SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON; HON. GERALD
  BALILES, FORMER GOVERNOR AND FORMER ATTORNEY GEN-
  ERAL, STATE OF VIRGINIA; AND HON. JEROME DIAMOND,
  FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF VERMONT

                       STATEMENT OF GRIFFIN BELL

  Mr. BELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, other members of the com-
mittee.

  I would like to begin by thanking the committee as an American
citizen for the good job you have done in these hearings. I have
seen a lot of these hearings, and I think this is a classic. It will be a
model for the future, and I want to congratulate you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. BELL. The duty under the Constitution to advise and consent
fits in very well with the idea that the Founding Fathers had that
they would not have judges stand for election, but they would insu-
late them by having the President select the judges and the Senate
would advise and consent. That has worked very well in the history
of our Republic, and it seems to be working well in this case.
  I tried to fashion a formula that you would use in a court of law,
and my idea would be that the President send a nominee to the
Senate with a rebuttable presumption that the person ought to be
confirmed; whereupon, the Senators would put the nominee
through vigorous and searching cross-examination, and if they
don't find something of serious important, they usually vote to con-
firm. That is exactly what has happened in this case.
   I went back and found Chairman Biden's test, and he used this
in the case of Justice O'Connor, where you said that the record
showed that she was a woman of competence, intellect, and high
moral standing, and has a record of 25 years or more of public serv-
ice that reflects a judicial bearing and a judicial temperament. And
you thought that was a sufficient basis to confirm Justice O'Con-
nor.
   I would adopt that test, and I would add two other things. One is
I would want a person to serve on our court that would seem to me
to be a decent person, a person of innate decency. I think Judge
Souter reflects that, reflects all of these qualifications. And I would
ask myself two questions. Has he demonstrated a vision of our
country and of our Constitution and our body of law and how it fits
together? I think he had done that. I watched a good deal of his
testimony on C-SPAN, and I think it has been remarkable. I think
he does have the right vision for our country and for the law of our
country.
  The last thing I would ask, before I voted for him, is would I
trust him with the office that he is about to assume and with the
responsibilities of that office or with our rights as American citi-
zens would I trust him. Having read some of his opinions and
watched him testify--I have only met him once in my life, until
                                          416

this morning. When I was serving as Attorney General of our coun-
try, he was the attorney general of New Hampshire, and I met him
at a meeting that we had with a number of the State attorneys
general.

   I believe that based on the record he ought to be confirmed. With
that, I will close and stand for questions at the appropriate time.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, General.
   Senator Gorton, welcome.

                    STATEMENT OF SENATOR GORTON

   Senator GORTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
   By coincidence, my first meeting with David Souter, the nomi-
nee, took place very close to the time at which Judge Bell first met
him. During Judge Bell's first year as Attorney General of the
United States, I was president of the National Association of Attor-
neys General, and Warren Rudman was finishing his distinguished
term as attorney general of New Hampshire. I may tell you, Mr.
Chairman, that I was disappointed that Warren left that position
and turned it over to an individual whom I had not previously
known and about whom I knew nothing.

  My wife and I had the good fortune to spend a long, 2- or 3-hour
lunch hour with Warren Rudman in which he introduced me to
David Souter in the first 2 or 3 months in which he was attorney
general of New Hampshire. I found him to be witty, delightful,
thoughtful, and intelligent during the course of that lunchtime,
and I did pay more attention to him than normally one State attor-
ney general from the far end of the country would from someone
from New England, for two reasons. The first was that he was the
successor of now Senator Rudman, who was then, as he is today, a
close friend of mine; and the second was that I was the president of
the national association and felt it important to make new mem-
bers welcome and to get some insight into their character and their
intelligence.

  If I may, I will share one story which shows something about his
wit, of which I was reminded very recently. During the week after
Judge Souter was nominated for this position and was here in
Washington, DC, going from office to office to meet the members of
this committee and of the leadership, he asked Senator Rudman
that I be added to that list at the end of the week, in spite of the
fact that I was not a member of the committee. After we had
talked in private for a while, he smiled and said, "Well, however
controversial my nomination is, Slade, you may remember that you
do have a legitimate reason for voting against my confirmation."
As I looked at him with a blank expression on my face, and he
said, "Well, you remember when we first met that summer when I
became attorney general, and it turned out that you and your pred-
ecessors had finally persuaded the attorney general of Hawaii to
invite you for your national winter meeting in Honolulu. And the
New Hampshire press came to me and said, "Are you going to
attend that boondoggle in Honolulu?" And I said, "I'll never waste
the taxpayers' money of New Hampshire on such a frolic as that."
And he said, "It got on the AP wire, and close to a dozen other at-
torneys general felt they had to cancel out on your meeting at the
                                         417

same time because of it. So if you hold that against me, I will un-
derstand it perfectly."

  I think that it shows both the sense of humor

   The CHAIRMAN. Did he go?

  Senator GORTON. Oh, no, he didn't go, and neither did the other
dozen. I had a rather small meeting there, Mr. Chairman.

  But even in the relatively short period of time that David Souter
was attorney general of New Hampshire, he showed to me--under
circumstances in which I had never thought that I would be in this
position with him--a thoughtful and an inquiring mind and a will-
ingness to learn from experience which I found notable among the
group of people with whom I dealt then. And I can think of no
qualities which are more important for a position on the Supreme
Court of the United States than that constant ability to learn, to
grow from the kind of experiences one has, and an inquiring mind
and the dedication to the ideals which made this country great.

  I think none of us, Mr. Chairman, even those of us who are
Members of the Senate of the United States, can quite or fully un-
derstand the awesome and lonesome responsibilities of being a
member of the Supreme Court of the United States and having the
Constitution of this great country in our hands. I feel that David
Souter can take on that responsibility thoughtfully, responsibly,
with an open mind, and that he can contribute greatly to the devel-
opment of legal institutions in this country.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
   Governor Baliles.

                   STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BALILES

   Mr. BALILES. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am
here in support of David H. Souter's nomination by the President
to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. In my judgment, Judge Souter is an individual who brings
objective intellect, integrity, and a centered view of judicial proce-
dure to the Nation's highest Court, an individual who shuns ideo-
logical leanings or prejudices in favor of a considered context of
legal principles and constitutional premise. In short, Judge Souter
is an individual who, in my view, is capable of addressing the
entire spectrum of issues required in a government of laws.

   I base my opinion upon the friendship struck nearly two decades
ago when he served as deputy attorney general of New Hampshire,
and I held the position of deputy attorney general of Virginia. I
worked closely with him for several years on matters relating to
the administration of the offices in which we served and on legal
issues which were of interest to the National Association of Attor-
neys General. We also worked closely together in the gathering of
evidence and in the writing of legal memoranda and briefs filed
before a special master in an original jurisdiction case then pend-
ing before the U.S. Supreme Court.

   During that time, we became good friends. We discussed the
issues of the day. We shared an interest in reading and protection
of the environment. During that period of 3 or 4 years of working
closely together, I do not ever recall him taking positions on major
political issues or promoting any ideological framework from which
                                          418

to approach issues. Simply stated, I knew him as an intellectually
gifted, analytical lawyer, a synthesizer of problems, empathetic, not
a populist but a rationalist, one who is moderate in tone and ex-
pression.

   I especially recall forming an early impression that here was
someone with impeccable integrity and honesty, who possessed a
wry sense of humor which would flash at unexpected points during
conversation.

   In 1976, I began serving in the Virginia General Assembly, and
Judge Souter was appointed attorney general of New Hampshire.
In 1981, I was elected attorney general of Virginia, and Judge
Souter was then serving as a member of the Superior Court in New
Hampshire. In 1985, I was elected Governor of Virginia, and Judge
Souter was serving on the supreme court of his native State.

   Today, I am partner in charge of international trade at the law
firm of Hunton and Williams. You may recall that this is the same
firm from which Justice Powell came, and I am struck by the simi-
larities in the personal qualities of these two men.

   My contact with Judge Souter understandably has not been as
frequent in recent years, but I have no reason to change my im-
pressions or qualify my friendship. Senator Rudman has kept me
apprised of Judge Souter's progress in New Hampshire, and the
judge and I have exchanged an occasional note or call. I count him
as a friend and believe that he will serve with distinction as a
member of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I urge his confirmation.

   Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. General Diamond, we are glad to
hear from you.

                    STATEMENT OF JEROME DIAMOND

  Mr. DIAMOND. Members of the committee, I guess I know David
Souter better than anyone else on this panel. He cost me my trip to
Hawaii because I was in the neighboring State of Vermont, and as
soon as he announced that he wasn't going, the press wanted to
know whether I was going.

  I served three terms as attorney general of Vermont, and the
middle term of 1976 to 1978 I had the pleasure of having David
Souter as a colleague and, as it developed, a friend in the next
State of New Hampshire. And I want to share with you some obser-
vations not only from those years but from some recent years; be-
cause while he left politics and became a judge, we maintained a
relationship that was more particularly focused in the last 4 years
as the result of an annual dinner that is shared--and I guess we
are going to have to give it a new name. It started in 1986 as the
"Annual Frank Bellotti Retirement Dinner," but hopefully today
he will be coming back out of retirement in the Massachusetts pri-
mary.

  The purpose was to bring together all the attorneys general from
the Eastern States, present and former, who had served during the
12 years that Frank Bellotti served as attorney general of Massa-
chusetts. It is a dinner once a year, and for me it was an opportuni-
ty to drive to Concord, NH, and meet up with David and our
mutual friend, Tom Rath, and spend the next IV2 hours going to
Boston that evening, and then IV2 hours in the car coming back,
                                         419

and to do that on an annual basis. It is from those evenings and
from the 2 years that we spent together that I would like to offer a
few comments.

  First, he ran a very, very efficient and effective office. We coop-
erated extensively on issues of law enforcement, antitrust, con-
sumer protection, and the environment. He did so with a handicap,
and the handicap was his method of selection as attorney general. I
think that that method of selection is very important and should
not be overlooked by this committee.

  He was not an elected attorney general. He was not even, like in
the State of New Jersey, an appointed attorney general who had
the right not to be removed from office by the same appointing au-
thority during the term of his office. He had the full extent of the
handicap. He was appointed by Governor and executive council,
and he could be removed by that same Governor and executive
council within his 2-year term. That by necessity made him more
of an attorney for the Governor and the executive agencies than
for the people themselves.

  We even debated this subject once on Rex Marshall's radio pro-
gram at the Hanover Inn. But I mention this because he made a
decision that could have cost him his job from which I gained a tre-
mendous respect for him. He appealed the Seabrook siting decision
on the basis of safety and environmental concerns. He did that in
the face of strong opposition from the Governor that had appointed
him and came close to losing his position. I found that that cour-
age, that commitment to issues, particularly in the tenuousness of
his position, was extremely admirable and something worthy of tre-
mendous respect.

  I had an opportunity to attend a law enforcement meeting back
at the time of the Seabrook protests. They had not begun at that
time, and it was a meeting of law enforcement officers from Ver-
mont and New Hampshire, State troopers, municipal officers, and
David Souter was in charge of the pre-planning meeting. Lots of
people have an opportunity to be treated with dignity if they are
dealing with peers.

   One attorney general to another attorney general, an attorney
general to his staff, you might be expected to see a real dignity ex-
tended towards other individuals. What I saw that day in a situa-
tion where few law enforcement officers ever have an opportunity
to have a one-on-one relationship with the attorney general of their
State was his treating each officer with the same type of dignity
that he extended to his fellow attorneys general and to members of
his staff. And it was something of a personal attribute that I was
extremely impressed with.

   I have to tell you, if it hasn't been brought out so far, that David
Souter does take a drink on occasion; he does smoke a cigar on oc-
casion. But in all the time that we have spent together, the issues
that have been discussed have been issues of politics and economics
and judicial misconduct and the environment--hours of discussion
in which I have to draw two conclusions. First, there is an honesty
and an integrity to him and to his thought processes that is a rare
commodity today. And, second, he is an individual that is about as
prejudice-free as any person I have ever met in my life.
                                                     420

   I can only really say that about two people, and, strangely
enough, by irony, both of them are from small towns in New
Hampshire. One is David Souter, and the other is my wife.

   Lastly, I want to talk about an issue
   The CHAIRMAN. We all have to think that of our wives. Other-
wise, they wouldn't have married us. [Laughter.]
   Mr. DIAMOND. Last, Senator Biden, I want an opportunity to ad-
dress an issue that really is, to me, the most important issue in-
volving his nomination.
   The CHAIRMAN. General, I don't want to push you too far, but I
don't want to get myself in trouble the rest of the day. You are
way over your 5 minutes. So if you could summarize, we would ap-
preciate it.
   Mr. DIAMOND. I will, indeed.
   To me the issue of civil rights and a commitment to the guaran-
tee and protection of civil rights is the most important issue facing
this committee and its decision on a nominee to the U.S. Supreme
Court. When I had an opportunity to work with Pat Leahy for 6
years as a State's attorney in Vermont, we came to know that our
grandparents as immigrants to this country--his Catholic, mine
Jewish--made us extremely aware that the guarantee of those civil
rights was the difference between this country and all others and
what made this country great.

   I am coming to this committee to say to you that I believe there
could be no fairer person than David Souter to sit on the Supreme
Court and to judge and to guarantee the civil rights to me and to
all my fellow citizens in this country. And, without reservation, I
hope that this committee will ultimately unanimously endorse his
nomination to the Court.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, General.
   Senator Thurmond.
   Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I am impressed. I don't know when we have had four more im-
pressive witnesses before this committee sitting at one time: a
former U.S. circuit judge and former U.S. Attorney General, able
former attorney general and able Senator from Washington State,
able former attorney general and able Governor of Virginia, and
able attorney general of Vermont. We thank you for coming here
and testifying. We appreciate your taking the time to do so.
   I am just going to ask you one question. I will ask it, and then
each one of you can answer it. Is it your opinion that Judge Souter
has the competency, the dedication, the courage, the integrity, and
the fairness to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States? We will start with you.
   Mr. BELL. That is my opinion.
   Senator GORTON. Yes, sir.

   Mr. BALILES. Yes.

   Mr. DIAMOND. Yes, sir.

   Senator THURMOND. That is all. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
   Senator HEFLIN. Judge Bell, we are delighted to see you back
here again. You add an element of trust to these proceedings.
Knowing your background on the fifth circuit in dealing with
judges and dealing with the Constitution while serving in the fifth
                                      421
circuit when it was at the forefront of the civil rights controversies,
how do you really develop a trust in a person? In other words,
what do you look at in order to determine whether we should en-
trust the Constitution to Judge Souter if he were to serve on the
Supreme Court?

  Mr. BELL. Well, you just have to make that judgment based on
all of the facts. But that is why I mentioned the vision. If he
doesn't have a vision of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights
and its subsequent amendments, particularly the 14th amendment,
and how that operates in our system with so many diverse people, I
don't think we could entrust the Constitution and our rights to
him. But I thought from what I have heard him say and from the
questions that were asked of him and what I read about him that
he does have that vision. He seems to be a person of--you know,
you can be intelligent, but you have got to put it all together some
way or another. He seems to understand the system. And he under-
stands the role that the Federal Government plays and the role
that the State governments play.

  I think that the federalizing influence, I call it, if you don't un-
derstand the federalizing influence in our Nation, it is difficult to
administer the Constitution. I think all those things added togeth-
er, I have the feeling that we can trust him. And that is all you
can do in the end. All judges in a sense are trustees of the Consti-
tution and all the laws, the precedents, even. That is why you
would have to have a decent respect for precedents. What harm
would it do? What harm is there in leaving the precedent as it is?

  Somebody brought up this morning whether Congress could take
away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Well, that has been
held by a decision shortly after the Civil War that the Congress
could take away the jurisdiction of the courts. That is a case called
Ex Parte McCardle. That case will have to be overruled, if that
ever arose again. I don't look forward in my lifetime to seeing the
Congress take the jurisdiction away from the Federal courts to ad-
minister the Constitution or some constitutional right. So I don't
think it will ever come up.

  All those things together give me the feeling that I could trust
him.

  Senator HEFLIN. He has written over 200 opinions. With you
serving on the fifth circuit with judges who wrote a similar number
of decisions, not restricted to Federal issues, do Mr. Souter's writ-
ings, looked at both collectively and separately, give you some
guidelines as to whether or not he can be a trustee of the Constitu-
tion and the precedents?

  Mr. BELL. Well, I think I read about five of his opinions. I was
struck with one where he dissented, and he dissented on the basis
of history. He cited Justice Holmes who said a page of history is
sometimes worth a volume of logic in his dissent. That shows some
vision. You have to understand history.

  I couldn't get a whole lot out of his opinions because most of
them deal with State issues, not with constitutional law. The one
opinion I didn't read but I read about it in the paper or I guess I
heard it on C-SPAN in the hearing, where he put the burden of
proof to show that someone ought to be confined in a mental insti-
tution as beyond a reasonable doubt, the same as you have in
                                                422

criminal law. That is a civil rights holding. That is in favor of
rights there. That gives you a clue.

  On the exclusionary rule under the New Hampshire Constitu-
tion, what you could call the exclusionary rule, he seemed to me to
come to the position in one case that the Supreme Court has now
come to, and that is a good-faith exception to some defect on a war-
rant in a search. Although he was not talking about the Federal
Constitution, he was talking about the New Hampshire Constitu-
tion.

  I have got a good feel for the way he approaches. He is a very
good writer, incidentally, and that will help a lot. If you can write
an opinion or another Law Review article, it will help the lawyers
of the country understand what the law is.

  That is a long answer to your question.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Diamond, you mentioned something that I
think is very important, that Mr. Souter was an appointed attorney
general and was appointed by the Governor and the executive
council. How is that council made up? Do you know?
  Mr. DIAMOND. I stand to be corrected, but I think there are five
members of the council, and they are elected from districts in the
State. I am not from New Hampshire.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct. I am not either, but I know that
one.
  Senator HEFLIN. And it is a 2-year term that he would serve at
the pleasure of the Governor and that executive council?
  Mr. DIAMOND. That is correct. I think it is a 2-year term, but it is
the appointment.
  Senator HEFLIN. That is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Would you please go to Senator Specter and
then come back to me?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I join in thanking you gentlemen for coming here today. You
make a very distinguished group of ex-attorneys general who have
held some other positions as well. While I never got to that lofty
ran, I served as a district attorney, so a number of our paths
crossed over.
  I don't want to take a great deal of time because we have so
many witnesses, but I would like to ask just one question so that
you do get some questions here.
  Judge Souter was very cautious in his responses, understandably
so. On quite a number of occasions, he responded in a way to avoid
making any enemies, again, an understandable position. I found
one of his answers just a little bit different, a little curious, when
Jie was asked and pressed--not by me but by another Senator--as
to some opinion from the Warren court with which he disagreed.
  Now, you men were attorneys general at a time when the
Warren court was handing down opinions which made life some-
what complicated, and the question that I would ask you relates to
any opinion with which you disagreed. While you think about that,
let me tell you one which came readily to my mind when the ques-
tion was posed, but I didn't have a chance to discuss it with Judge
Souter because of the shortness of time.
                                                    423

  I recall very well the day Miranda v. Arizona came down. It was
a long opinion, and I remember the day, June 13, requiring warn-
ings be given. I was district attorney of Philadelphia and went to
work and got out a warning card by that Friday. It came down on
a Monday, as opinions do, and I was really worried about what that
case was going to do because it required that police officers give
five detailed warnings and extract detailed waivers, as I know you
men remember.

  Then the following Monday, a decision came down from the Su-
preme Court. I think it was Johnson v. New Jersey, but I haven't
reviewed it recently. But the importance of the case was that any
case that went to trial after the date of Miranda had to have had
those warnings. I had hundreds of serious cases, some involving
murder with powerful evidence, where the police officers had fol-
lowed the rules, in effect, the Escobedo warnings, substantially
lesser than the Miranda warnings. And a great many very, very
serious cases had to be dismissed because of what I thought was a
rule that simply couldn't be complied with, to extract a standard
on questioning a defendant on warnings, which no one could have
known about because they hadn't been articulated by the Supreme
Court when the cases were investigated.

  We had one case in May of that year, a robbery murder case. A
man confessed, was given the Escobedo warnings, traced his apart-
ment, found the gun, and then a month later the Miranda warn-
ings came down, and that man couldn't be tried before the Miran-
da warnings came down. So I would ask each of you distinguished
lawyers who have had in part your law enforcement responsibility
to name, if you would, a decision from the Warren court that you
thought was unduly restrictive on law enforcement.

  The CHAIRMAN. AS your attorney, before you answer, be careful
because one of you may be up for confirmation some day, at which
time you may have to reconsider the answer you gave.

  Senator SPECTER. It also bears on the credibility of your prior tes-
timony.

  Mr. BELL. I will go first. I never had the trouble with Miranda
except the retroactivity feature. Miranda has made law enforce-
ment better. It has also protected the rights of the individual in the
country. It turned out to be a very good decision. The retroactive
question is different. It is hard to sit on a court and find a constitu-
tional right and then say, well, we won't apply that to anyone who
has engaged in wrongdoing before the date of this opinion. So you
are trying hundreds of people who have been denied a constitution-
al right. The question is whether it applied to them. You are
driven almost to the position that it has to be made retroactive.
That was the problem you are speaking of.

  The only other opinion that the Warren court handed down in
criminal law that I had any trouble with--and I still do have some
trouble with--is the exclusionary rule, but that has been adjusted
now by a good-faith exception.

  Senator SPECTER. Attorney General Gorton.
  Senator GORTON. I guess that, while great problems were created
for you and your career by the Miranda decision, Senator Specter,
it is rather difficult to imagine that a decision would reverse a con-
viction, as it did in the Miranda case, and apply to that individual
                                                424

only. It does not seem logical that it would not apply to other indi-
viduals who had not yet been tried, as great as the difficulties as it
may have created for law enforcement at the point.

  Now, I have a disadvantage in answering your question, not
shared by Judge Bell, certainly not shared by Judge Souter--I am
not certain about these other two Attorneys General. I had a won-
derful job, as attorney general, but in the State of Washington the
attorney general has absolutely nothing to do with criminal justice,
either in initial prosecutions or in appeals or any other stage of a
process that is entirely localized.

  So, reactions which I would have had to the judgments of the
Warren Court, which, of course, started well before I was attorney
general and ended shortly after I took that position, would have
been academic.

  You put me at a great disadvantage. I would have to tell you
that, if we went through case by case, I am sure I could give you a
number of cases with which I disagreed, both in criminal proce-
dure, in the abstract sense, and the impact that they may have had
on the job which I did at the time.

  I also think it is important to say something else, and your ques-
tion leads to this. I suspect, like Griffin Bell would be, I would
rather imagine that I would criticize Miranda and felt that it was
wrong at the time that it was handed down. I have come to a dif-
ferent view since then, simply by reason of experience and by what
I do think, although there have been some difficulties, there have
been improvements in law enforcement.

  I would be surprised and a little bit suspicious, if you had a
nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States before you
who was willing to tell you how he would rule on some case that
would take place in the future. We give these jobs for life and in a
fairly isolated and insulated position, so that they will be free from
the strictures of politics to which we are properly subjected, so that
they can be scholars, so that they can learn, and they can develop.

  As you know, many of us have had occasions to change our
minds on political issues and on legal issues, as well. Most of the
controversy, not all of them, but most of the controversial decisions
of the Warren court were not unanimous. Many of them were 5 to
4. Very frequently at the time, I found the reasoning of the dissent-
ers to be better than the reasoning of the majority, and on some of
those I have changed my mind and on some of those I have not.
But we can only go through it case-by-case, in order for me to
answer your question intelligently at this stage, since I am ten
years now from having been an attorney general.

  Senator SPECTER. Governor Baliles.
  Mr. BALILES. Senator, by the time I became attorney general, at
the time I worked with Judge Souter, the Warren court rulings
were already on the books. But whether it was a Warren court de-
cision or a subsequent Court decision, I really did not place a lot of
stock in what my own personal opinion might be about the decision
itself, because, just as the Members of the Senate and many other
people in this country, I accept the proposition that when the Su-
preme Court rules on an issue of law, that is determinative, unless
the Constitution is amended or, where appropriate, where Congress
has the authority to change the ruling.
                                         425

  So, when the Court decision came down, whether I agreed with it
or not, my focus was primarily one of determining what did the
Court say, to whom did the decision apply, were there any excep-
tions, what advice should I give the Governor, the General Assem-
bly, law enforcement officials or State agency administrators. Then
I would, on occasion, confer with other attorneys general around
the country, with staff, make a determination and give my advice.

  My personal feelings really did not have very much to do with
the advice I gave, because this was a matter involving the law and
not necessarily a personal feeling about the correctness of a Court
decision.

  Senator SPECTER. General Diamond.
  Mr. DIAMOND. Senator, I think that, like Judge Bell, the retroac-
tivity was more of an issue than Miranda, but it turned out to be,
in our experience, not a significant problem, because most of the
cases that were pending at that time, by chance, did not rely upon
confessions for the central focus of the prosecution, and so we were
not dealing with that particular issue.
  The exclusionary rule was probably, from my standpoint, the
most difficult--and I think I still feel that way--with regard to the
Warren court decisions, and I was very pleased to see a good-faith
exception carved by a later Supreme Court, but still have to deal
with the issue that in the State of Vermont that good-faith excep-
tion is not recognized by our own State law, where Federal issues
are not involved.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, gentlemen. My time is
up. I think that the answers are really significant, for this reason:
When we have gone through these proceedings, we have probed
very hard to find where Judge Souter stands on the line of inter-
pretivism versus judicial activism. There has been an enormous
amount of criticism of judicial activism, and I have been critical of
it in a number of aspects, and there has been a tremendous gener-
alization of criticism about the activist Warren court.

  But when Judge Souter was asked about any opinion that he dis-
agreed with, not limited only to law enforcement, but one-man/
one-vote and many other lines, he did not cite any case, did not feel
comfortable, for a variety of reasons or whatever reason, in not
citing a case. And now we have four very experienced and distin-
guished lawyers, public officials, ex-prosecutors and asked about
the expanse of the activist Warren court, and nothing readily leads
to mind.

  I realize that it is not easy to go back and pick up specific cases,
and the one that is mentioned is the exclusionary, and even in Ver-
mont the exclusionary rule is maintained rigidly, without the good-
faith exception. So, perhaps this question tells us something about
how bad the activist Warren court was, or perhaps how it was not
so bad.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Every day, in my view, the wisdom of the
Warren court becomes more apparent.
  The Senator from Vermont.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I apologize again for being out be-
cause of the farm bill conference, but I see four good friends here--
Griffin Bell, Slade Gorton, Gerry Baliles and Jerry Diamond. I
                                                    426

would just note that, in Vermont, we have been blessed with good
leaders in the law enforcement field.

  To be totally bipartisan about this, Senator Thurmond, I would
mention first a Republican attorney general, who is now Chief
Judge of the second circuit, Jim Oakes, whom I had the pleasure of
serving with when I was State's attorney, and ever since then a
very, very close friend. Jerry Diamond was State's attorney of
Windham County down near the New Hampshire border when I
was State's attorney of Chittenden County. Jerry went on, howev-
er, to a higher position in law enforcement and became attorney
general, while I disappeared into the obscurity of the U.S. Senate.

  I have listened to the testimony of these four witnesses, as I have
been trying to get back from another meeting on an entirely differ-
ent issue. I have no questions, but I did want to welcome all four of
them. The other three I have worked with and know well and they
are all good friends of mine, who will excuse me if I make a special
welcome to Jerry Diamond, a neighbor and a close friend. We
began our careers together as prosecutors, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Bell, you said that there is a rebuttable
presumption that the President's choice ought to be confirmed, and
I agree with you. Many others--I should not say many others on
this committee, a few others, including Chairman Biden, on the
other hand, have spoken in terms of the burden of proof being on
Judge Souter.

  Now, that is quite a different standard from what you enunci-
ated, Judge Bell, at least that is the way it seems to me, and it
seems that we are, in a sense, ratcheting up quite a bit here, you
know, is it the burden of production, is it a burden of persuasion, is
it by a preponderance of evidence, or is it beyond a reasonable
doubt.

  It seems to me that, once you start using this burden of proof
metaphor, that you set up criteria that fails to set a clear, objective
standard. Of course, any Senator can adopt whatever personal
standard that he or she chooses. But I would like to ask you, Judge
Bell, why do you think that a presumption of approval is a better
way?

  Mr. BELL. Well, I think it is a better way, because I do not agree
with the burden of proof being put on the nominee. The President
has already investigated him before he sent his name over here, I
would assume, in all cases, and the Senate then undertakes to
cross-examine him and bring out anything wrong with him. That
has been done. As I said in the beginning, this is a classic hearing.
It is one of the best I ever remember. This man has been vigorously
cross-examined.

  If you put the burden of proof on him, what will the next candi-
date do? He will come over and he will try to get a poll to find out
what everyone is thinking, and maybe he will come over and make
a great statement, taking solid positions on four or five big issues
which have to do directly with what he is going to be called upon
to decide. I do not know where that would take us.

  I am saying that putting the burden of proof on the nominee
would seem to me to be a dangerous approach, and it probably
                                              427

would be better not to get into these standards that you are using,
burden of persuasion, burden of going forwards, and those sorts of
things. Those are highly technical theorems that are used in a trial
and sometimes even the lawyers do not understand them. It is hard
for me to understand what the burden of going forward is, for ex-
ample. That gets too technical.

  Just to let the President send somebody over here, he seems to
have sent a good man here, and then the Senate needs to make cer-
tain that he is good and follow the Biden test, and you have done
that. That is the way I would leave it.

  The reason I use that rebuttable presumption is that is an easy
way to decide something.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I thank you very much. I would like to go on
to another point I would like to make.

  Every one of us, and many Court watchers, as well, since we
have heard Judge Souter now for 3 days, are engaged in the games
of guessing where he will fit into this Court spectrum. I would like
to ask each of you to compare, assuming that Justice Marshall is
on one end and Justice Scalia is on the other end, where you might
feel, after listening to Judge Souter for these 2x/2 days, you think
he might come down.

  Senator GORTON. Somewhere between the two. [Laughter.]
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Bell.
  Mr. BELL. I have the feeling that he is rather moderate in his
views, somewhere around the middle. The thing about a court is
there has to be a middle. It would be a tough country, if we did not
have a middle. We would turn it into a nation of extremists. We
have got 10 percent on each end, but somebody has to be in the
middle, and I have a feeling that is the way he would turn out.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Baliles.
  Mr. BALILES. Senator, based on my own personal knowledge and
working experience with Judge Souter, I would categorize him, as I
stated or suggested in my remarks, that he is moderate in tone and
in expression, and for the reason I stated, the personal qualities
that he possesses remind me a great deal of Justice Powell, who I
think also fits into that category of being moderate in tone and in
expression.

  Mr. DIAMOND. Senator, I think that central to Judge Souter's
philosophy is the dignity and freedom of the individual. I think
that will, rather than put it on a continuum, will probably lead
him to be a strong supporter and guarantor of civil liberties, I
think he will take a strong stand on law enforcement issues, for
antitrust enforcement. I think that those are things he has demon-
strated in the past.

  I do not know how that fits on a continuum between the two Jus-
tices that you named, but I think that that is a very central philos-
ophy to his life, to him as a judge, and that will probably be preva-
lent for him as a Justice.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would not argue with your characterization
of how you suggest he might come down, but that leads me, then,
to my final question, and I would ask this just of the three Demo-
crat partisans on the panel. Is this the best that you can hope for,
in terms of judicial philosophy?
                                         428

   Mr. BELL. Well, I am not a partisan Democrat. I am a Democrat,
but I am not a partisan Democrat and I have rather conservative
views about things.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I will let you describe your
  Mr. BELL. Just because you are a Democrat does not mean you
cannot have conservative views about matters.
  I think the President has sent somebody over here who is moder-
ate in tone, as somebody on the panel said. I do not know where he
will come out. I think that much is being made over the abortion
issue. We seem to overlook the fact that there are two parts of the
abortion opinion, one that receives more criticism is the trimester
system, which was set up by the Supreme Court. Many people
think that the Supreme Court passed a law, a court of law, by set-
ting up the trimester system. That can be totally separated from
the rest of the opinion.

  In addition to that, one of the big things that has happened here
is Judge Souter said that he had no trouble finding the right of pri-
vacy in the 14th amendment. If privacy is a constitutional right, as
the Supreme Court has held in other cases, and five Justices think
it is a constitutional right, then the Congress can deal with the
entire problem under section 5 of the 14th amendment. There is no
danger of anybody losing a right, if it is a constitutional right, be-
cause Congress has got the duty to enforce the 14th amendment. So
you might end up having to deal with the trimester system, and if
so, that would be the end of the matter, you would just simply pass
a code of law.

  That is one of the big complaints that I have heard over the
years about the abortion decision, and it is unfortunate that the
issue of privacy, and a woman's right to control her own body is
one of the most sensitive things that there is in the society, and we
get it totally mixed up by criticizing an opinion which can be
straightened out, if necessary, if that is the way they come out. It
is not necessary that it just be totally overruled. I think out of the
hearing that is the one thing that has gotten almost out of hand, I
think, is that one issue.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Could I hear from Mr. Diamond and Mr. Ba-
liles on my question about how you see it, from the standpoint of
being a Democrat?

  Mr. BALILES. Senator, the fact is that there is a vacancy on the
Court and the President has sent the U.S. Senate a nominee. I
think, if you are asking my opinion, Judge Souter is qualified to
serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. I may not agree with all of his
decisions in the future, but I am satisfied that his approach to legal
issues, the process by which he examines legal questions will serve
this country well.

  In a time in which many things are going on in our society, the
complexity, the mobility, the transient nature of our country, the
issues that will face the Court for many years to come, I think re-
quires someone who has a sense of history, as well as a sense of
humor, someone who has an understanding of the Government
structure in this Nation and the principles upon which our Consti-
tution are based.
                                         429

  I am satisfied that he possesses the qualifications to serve on the
Court, and I think ultimately that is your decision that you are
going to have to make.

  Mr. DIAMOND. Senator, first of all, I adopt Governor Baliles'
statement. I think what he said is very accurate, very true, and I
would just like to offer one addition to that.

  I would consider myself far more liberal on issues than David
Souter. I know of at least three other Democratic attorneys general
that served with him in the New England area that wanted very
much to come to testify on his behalf today, all of them far more
liberal than David Souter, but all of us have something in common.

   The CHAIRMAN. Let us make it clear, so you do not leave the
wrong impression, none of them were prevented from coming
today?

  Mr. DIAMOND. Not by this committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Anyone that wanted to come was able to come,
let us make sure we have got that straight.
  Mr. DIAMOND. They were certainly not prevented by this commit-
tee, no.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sometimes, statements like that, unintended, get
blown out of proportion in these debates.
   Mr. DIAMOND. I think the thing that all of us share with Judge
Souter, at least we believe we do, is his basic philosophy with
regard to the dignity and freedom of the individual, as being a cen-
tral judicial philosophy.
  Now, as far as I am concerned, that is central to a liberal philos-
ophy, as well as a conservative philosophy and is rooted in both.
So, I do not know if that answers your question about whether it is
the best President Bush could have sent up, but he is certainly
someone with whom we felt quite comfortable, from a philosophic
standpoint.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Gentlemen, thank you all very much. We appreciate you taking
the time and making the effort.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me ask--we have each of our caucuses,
the caucuses meaning that the Democrats are caucusing and dis-
cussing important issues that are coming before the Senate, that
started at 12:30, as well as the Republicans doing that. I am trying
to make a judgment here and I will yield to my colleagues for a
moment.
  We have the next panel, a very important panel, as well, made of
three people. Let us see if we can get it finished in half an hour,
because I know myself, and I suspect that others have to be at our
caucus before it closes out, so let us attempt to do one more panel
between now and 1:30.
  Ms. Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel of the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund; Joseph L.
Rauh, Jr., general counsel, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights;
and Joan Bronk, president of the National Council of Jewish
Women.
  Would you please come forward. Ms. Hernandez, why don't we
begin with you and your testimony. Keep in mind our 5-minute
rule, if you would, please.

PANEL CONSISTING OF ANTONIA HERNANDEZ, PRESIDENT AND
   GENERAL COUNSEL, MEXICAN-AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE
   AND EDUCATION FUND; JOSEPH L. RAUH, JR., GENERAL COUN-
   SEL, LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS; AND JOAN
   BRONK, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN

                  STATEMENT OF ANTONIA HERNANDEZ

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Thank you, and I will try to do that.
   I have submitted extensive written testimony and I will not try
to at this point in time read it
   The CHAIRMAN. The entire statement will be entered in the
record.
   Ms. HERNANDEZ [continuing]. But I will try to consolidate the
concerns that we have in my statement.
   I am Antonia Hernandez, I am the president and general counsel
of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund. This
statement is submitted on behalf of MALDEF in opposition to
Senate confirmation of David Souter as an Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   In this statement, I address three primary matters: The back-
ground of MALDEF's concerns about David Souter; second, Judge
Souter's record antagonistic to civil rights and constitutional provi-
sions which protect the rights of Hispanics; and, three, Judge
Souter's refusal to disavow personally those antagonistic positions
during his first 2 days of testimony before this committee.
   Because of the Nation's history of invidious discrimination
against Hispanics, and because of the U.S. Supreme Court's unique
role for more than 30 years in beginning to vindicate the civil and
constitutional rights of Hispanics, we Hispanics have placed par-
ticular reliance on the Supreme Court in assuring our civil and
constitutional rights, and it is in light of our concern that we have
serious fears and concerns.
   We firmly believe that in 1990, no individual should be con-
firmed, unless he or she has demonstrated an understanding and a
commitment to equal justice and views the Court as an appropriate
vehicle to redress these rights and understands these commitments
should be based on past records.
   Our organization withheld opposition until we heard Judge
Souter's testimony, and we take this position not lightly. But in lis-
tening to his 2 days of testimony--and I must confess that I did not
listen to all of it yesterday, I was in flight between Los Angeles and
Washington, DC, but in listening to the last 2 days of his testimo-
ny, we remain seriously concerned that Judge Souter has no under-
standing nor limited understanding or commitment to issues of
concern to Hispanics.
   Because of the fact that the incidents antagonistic to civil rights
occurred when Judge Souter was acting in his official capacity as a
lawyer, advocating the New Hampshire Office of Attorney General,
and even aside from his oath of office and the manner in which he
excessively pursued his position hostile to civil rights, we withheld
judgment. Our hope was that maybe, just maybe his personal posi-
tions had been different from and more compassionate than the
hostile position he had advanced in his official capacity on behalf
of the State of New Hampshire, and that he had been misquoted by
                                          431

the media in his sound bite characterization of affirmative action
as affirmative discrimination. Our hope, however, was quickly
dashed by Judge Souter's own testimony in his first 2 days before
this committee.

   In summary, he repeatedly declined to offer any personal views
at the time contrary to the hostile positions to civil rights, in gen-
eral, and to Congress' power under section 5 of the 14th amend-
ment, in particular. He had aggressively pursued, on behalf of the
State of New Hampshire, and, maybe even worse, Judge Souter
failed to demonstrate any capacity for fairness to and, much less,
compassion for the individuals who would be forever affected by his
rulings and votes as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

   This is not to deny and certainly not degrade the testimony he
gave, finally recognizing that, still today, there is enormous need to
remedy the wrongs done by our Nation and within our Nation
through the history of invidious discrimination.

   Although his testimony constitutes a fairly accurate summary of
the constitutionality and legally permissible scope of affirmative
action allowed under current Supreme Court rulings, nowhere in
his testimony did Judge Souter deny the characterizations reported
in his 1976 speech. In fact, almost nowhere did Judge Souter refer
to his own views of affirmative action, either as a constitutional
matter or as a matter of statutory construction or of congressional
power.

   All that Judge Souter has left with us, with any certainty, is that
there are matters "which will be played out in constitutional litiga-
tion for some time ahead of us." But for those of us who are His-
panic and female, this is not just an intellectual game "to be
played out."

   Moreover troublesome, indeed, determinative for MALDEF, has
been Judge Souter's repeated refusal, after repeated opportunities
to discuss his personal views as possibly compassion on civil rights
and more deferential to congressional power under section 5 of the
14th amendment. From the extreme and cold position he advanced
as an assistant attorney general, as an attorney general, challeng-
ing Congress' pan on the literacy tests for voting as unconstitution-
al, and challenging Congress' title VII recordkeeping requirement
as unconstitutional.

  In Judge Souter's opening statement before this committee, he
has said nothing about civil rights and nothing at all concerning
the power of Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment.

  Judge Souter, on the other hand, did readily concede that one of
the lessons learned by him as a trial judge, a lesson that is readily
apparent to anyone who has ever been before a trial judge, was
that, at the end of our judicial test, some human being is going to
be affected.

  Judge Souter's personal views on civil rights were inquired into
thereafter by several Senators, but Judge Souter refused to disclose
his personal beliefs or positions.

  Apart from Judge Souter's overall nonresponsiveness in his 2
days of testimony, much less his apparently continuing hostility to
the Supreme Court's recognition of Congress' power under sec-
tion 5 of the 14th amendment and under section 2 of the 15th
amendment, the fact of the matter is that, although provided with
                                              432

plentiful opportunity to do so, Judge Souter has not demonstrated
fairness for and any compassion about those of us, particularly
Hispanics who for so long have been denied not just the promise of
the American dream, but, more basically, the equal opportunity of the
law. In addition to Judge Souter's nonresponsiveness, his evident
lack of feeling and of compassion and his continued hostility to this
committee on the issues that we care about should be a consider-
ation. This fact pertains to Judge Souter's admiration for, among
all Supreme Court Justices, of not the first Justice Harlan but the
second Justice Harlan. Please remember that their philosophies
are leagues apart.

  The first Justice Harlan, now often remembered only for one his-
torical dissenting opinion, provided the Supreme Court's sole dis-
sent in Plessy v. Ferguson. This is not the Justice Harlan who
Judge Souter admires. Instead, Judge Souter admires most, among
all Supreme Court Justices, the second Justice Harlan, who wrote
the dissenting opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan, expressing the
view that Congress essentially has no power whatsoever to legislate
under section 5 of the 14th amendment from or beyond that al-
ready deemed to be unconstitutional by the judiciary.

  I must add that in listening to former Attorney General Griffin
Bell in his explanation of the issue of choice, that Congress defi-
nitely has the power under section 5 of the 14th amendment to
deal with the Roe v. Wade issue, we are concerned that there is a
question as to Judge Souter's belief that Congress does, in fact,
have this power.

  Judge Souter has not demonstrated fairness or even compassion
for racial minorities, particularly with regard to our trying to win
nondiscriminatory opportunities to equal employment, and to our
most fundamental right under the Constitution and the laws of our
country, the right to vote.

  Therefore, accordingly, MALDEF opposes the confirmation of
Souter as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Thank you.

                               STATEMENT OF AMTONIA HERNANDEZ

         I am Antonia Hernandez, the President and General Counsel of
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund
("MALDEF"). This Statement is submitted on behalf of MALDEF in
opposition to Senate confirmation of David H. Souter as an
Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

         In this Statement, I address hereafter three primary
matters: (1) the background of MALDEF's concern about David H.
Souter; (2) Judge Souter's record antagonistic to civil rights
laws and constitutional provisions which protect the rights of
Hispanics; and (3) Judge Souter's refusal to disavow personally
these antagonistic positions during his testimony before this
Committee.

I. The Background of MALDEF'3 Oppoaition to Judge Souter

         Because of our nation's history of invidious discrimination
against Hispanics, and because of the United States Supreme
Court's unique role for more than thirty years (1954-1988) in
beginning to vindicate the civil and constitutional rights of
Hispanics, we Hispanics have placed particular reliance on the
Supreme Court in assuring our civil and constitutional rights.

        The history of discrimination against Hispanics in this
country, particularly in the Southwest and especially from the
                                     435

mid-Nineteenth Century to date,1 has been not unlike that

suffered by African Americans. We Hispanics have been subjected

to segregation in schools, in restaurants, and in hotels. We

have been denied employment, and often treated badly when

employed. We have been denied the opportunity to serve on

juries. And we have even been denied the most fundamental of

rights, the right to vote.

         But we Hispanics, like African Americans in our country,

were finally given hope in 1954 by the United States Supreme

Court. In fact, two weeks prior to the Supreme Court's unanimous

ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. 347 U.S. 483

(1954) (holding school segregation unconstitutional), the Supreme

Court in Hernandez v. Texas. 347 U.S. 475 (1954), unanimously

decided that Mexican Americans were protected by the Fourteenth

Amendment, and unanimously held that the exclusion of Mexican

Americans from juries in Texas violated the Fourteenth

Amendment's equal protection clause. In subsequent years, it

again was the Supreme Court -- and thereafter also Congress --

that continued to recognize some of our basic civil rights.

1. This nation's discrimination against Hispanics dates back at
least to the period following the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-
Hidalgo, through which Mexico ceded to the United States
territory which would become the states of Arizona, California,
Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, and which would become parts of
Nevada and Utah. Article IX of that Treaty guaranteed all
persons of Mexican origin continuing to reside in that territory
not only United States citizenship but also "the enjoyment of all
the rights of the citizens of the United States according to the
principles of the Constitution," including of course "free
enjoyment of their liberty and property." Despite these
guarantees, what the once-Mexican population received instead was
more than a century of subjugation.
                                     436

        This fight to establish our basic civil and constitutional
rights has not been an easy one. It in fact has required MALDEF
attorneys to file and to litigate hundreds of lawsuits. And a
number of our lawsuits have ended up in the United States Supreme
Court.

        A prime example is the voting rights case of White v.
Regester. 412 U.S. 755 (1973). In this case, a unanimous Supreme
Court struck down Texas' imposition of a multimember legislative
district in Bexar County, a heavily Hispanic county where San
Antonio is located. Based on such facts as the reality that only
five Hispanics in nearly 100 years had ever been elected to the
Texas Legislature from Bexar County, the Supreme Court upheld our
claim that the multimember district diluted the votes of
Hispanics in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court
thus affirmed the remedial redrawing of single-member districts.

        Apart from the Supreme Court's decision in White and its
earlier decision in Hernandezf few of our victories have been the
result of unanimous decisions by the Supreme Court. Instead --
and increasingly in the 1980s -- we faced a divided Supreme
Court, a Court which in fact often was very closely divided on
issues of special importance to Hispanics.

         For example, in Plyler v. Doe. 457 U.S. 202 (1982), we
challenged Texas' denial of a public school education to
undocumented Hispanic children. These children were Texas
residents most of whom would eventually become legal residents,
but who, without an education, would become a permanent
                                      437

underclass. The Supreme Court in this case agreed that Texas'
policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. But the Court reached this decision
through a bare 5-4 majority, with Justice Lewis Powell joining
the majority decision written by Justice William Brennan.

         Following the resignation of Justice Powell and his
replacement by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court --
within a matter of weeks in June, 1989 -- rendered usually on
five-to-four votes a series of decisions devastating to the
rights of Hispanics, other minorities, and women to a
discrimination-free workplace. These decisions2 are, of course,

2. These decisions, listed roughly in chronological order,
include the following: Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio. 490
U.S. , 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (June 5, 1989)
(reallocating burdens of proof, among other things, in Title VII
disparate impact cases); Martin v. Wilks. 490 U.S. , 109 S.Ct.
2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (June 12, 1989) (permitting "reverse
discrimination" collateral attacks on consent decrees at any
time); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies. Inc.. 490 U.S. , 109
S.Ct. 2261, 104 L.Ed.2d 961 (June 12, 1989) (striking down EEOC
charges as untimely under Title VII when filed shortly after the
discrimination affected the female charging parties); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union. 491 U.S. , 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d
132 (June 15, 1989) (eviscerating § 1981 by limiting it to
intentional discrimination only in the formation of contracts);
Jett v. Dallas Independent School District. 491 U.S. , 109
S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (June 22, 1989) (further eviscerating
§ 1981 in the public sector by subjecting it to the "policymaker"
constraints governing § 1983 lawsuits); Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants v. Zipes. 491 U.S. , 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105
L.Ed.2d 639 (June 22, 1989) (disallowing statutory attorneys fees
to successful Title VII plaintiffs who had to litigate for years
against an intervening defendant's attack on their back pay and
seniority remedies); cf. Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio V. Betts. 492 U.S. , 109 S.Ct. 2854, 106 L.Ed.2d 134

well known to the United States Senate given the vast amount of
time that the Senate has had to expend to try to restore prior
law through the Civil Rights Act of 1990 (S. 2104), legislation
initially passed two months ago by the Senate on a lopsided 65-
34 vote.3 In the meantime, the effect upon Hispanics of these
recent Supreme Court decisions has been particularly devastating
in view of the increased discrimination against Hispanics, as
revealed by recent documentation showing that as many as 19% of
all employers are now engaging in discrimination against
"foreign-looking" or "foreign-sounding" employees and job
applicants.4

        Whether last year's Supreme Court decisions hostile to the
civil and constitutional rights of Hispanics actually signal a
Supreme Court retrenchment or turning-back-of-the-clock on civil
rights, I have little doubt that the next person confirmed as an
Associate Justice on the Supreme Court will in fact have a major
impact upon the future course of Supreme Court adjudication:
either at least occasionally respecting and vindicating the civil
and constitutional rights of Hispanics, or denying our rights
altogether.

        The reason for this determinative impact is obvious. The
next nominee confirmed by the Senate will not this time be

the House last month by a similarly lopsided vote of 272-154.

replacing Justice Powell, who had been a swing-vote moderate on
the Court. Instead, the next nominee will be replacing Justice
Brennan, whose fairness and compassion for civil and
constitutional rights were crucial to the rights of Hispanics.

        With Justice Brennan no longer on the Supreme Court, and
with the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, I am
of course concerned about his possible replacement, and I am
particularly concerned about the capacity for fairness and
compassion of the person nominated to succeed Justice Brennan.

II. Judge Souter1s Record Reflects Antagonism to Civil
         Rights Laws and Constitutional Provisions which Protect
         the Rights of Hispanics

        Judge Souter did not come to his confirmation hearing before
this Committee with an extensive record on matters of national
origin and racial discrimination barred by federal civil rights
laws and by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

         On the other hand, Judge Souter does have a limited written
and oral record on these matters, a record which is noteworthy
for the singular fact that in every instance in which he
expressed himself his actions and expressions were hostile not
only to civil rights laws but also to constitutional provisions
essential to protect the rights of Hispanics. Equally troubling
to me is the fact that several of these hostile actions and
expressions were taken by Judge Souter at a time when, as an
                                      440

Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General, he was under
an oath of office requiring him to uphold the Constitution of the
United States.

         The hostile incidents to which I am referring, as the
Members of this Committee are aware, involve Judge Souter's
actions and expressions in the areas of employment discrimination
law, voting rights, and affirmative action. I briefly review
hereafter Judge Souter's past actions and expressions in each of
these three areas of particular importance to Hispanics.

         A. Employment Discrimination Law
         Two of the most troublesome parts of Judge Souter's record
are both the arguments he made and the extent he went to make
those arguments in his constitutional challenge to Title VII's
recordkeeping requirements in the case of United States v. New
Hampshire. 539 F.2d 277 (1st Cir. 1976), cert, denied. 429 U.S.
1023 (1976). In order to understand both aspects, it may be
useful first to set forth the factors relevant to both the
factual and constitutional context of this litigation.
         1. Our nation's basic law barring employment
discrimination, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
initially barred discrimination only in the private sector.
Based thereafter on a record of discrimination in the public
sector and of a need for effective remedies therefor, Congress
through the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 extended
                                      441

Title VII to the public sector.5 It is thus at this time that
Title VII became applicable to New Hampshire.

         2. At the time of Congress' extension of Title VII to the
states under its enforcement power in Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, it had been hornbook Supreme Court law for nearly one
hundred years that "Congress is authorized to enforce the
prohibitions [of the Fourteenth Amendment] by appropriate
legislation." Ex Parte Virginia. 100 U.S. 339, 345 (1880)
(emphasis by the Court, brackets added). And it is pursuant to
Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment that the Supreme Court
upheld the constitutionality of the arguably more intrusive
Voting Rights Act of 1965.6

         3. A section of Title VII crucial to its effective
enforcement expressly requires every employer covered by Title
VII to maintain and to preserve "records relevant to the
determination of whether unlawful employment practices have been
or are being committed," and to make "such reports therefrom" as

requirement, and despite the routine provision by employers to
the EEOC annually of employer workforce data by national origin,
race, and gender, New Hampshire refused to provide the EEOC with
national origin and race data for 1973 and refused to provide any
data whatsoever for 1974. New Hampshire, in fact, was the only
state to refuse compliance.

        Against this backdrop, the United States had to file suit
against New Hampshire in mid-1975 to compel compliance with our
nation's most fundamental employment discrimination law. New
Hampshire's answer to this lawsuit was that the information
required by the statute was irrelevant and that Title VII in any
event was unconstitutional. On cross motions for summary
judgment, the United States District Court entered a one-page
order ruling against New Hampshire and thus compelling
compliance. United States v. New Hampshire. No. 75-197 (D.N.H.
Dec. 22, 1975).

        The extent of Assistant Attorney General Souter's
involvement in formulating this "states' rights" policy of
resistance and in initially defending the policy remains unclear.

Undisputed, on the other hand, is his direct involvement in the
appeals he zealously pursued after being sworn in as Attorney
General in January, 1976.

         The appellate brief he filed in the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit reflects a profound
misunderstanding (or a hoped-for refutation) both of evidentiary
proof in civil rights cases and of established congressional
power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The essence
of both misunderstandings (or hoped-for changes in the law) is
reflected in Attorney General Souter's summary contention that
the statutorily required recordkeeping "adds nothing essential to
the program against unlawful employment practices; it only
creates a gratuitous layer of accountability to the federal
government, contrary to constitutional principles limiting
federal power." Brief for Appellant at 7. This summary
contention, like his subsidiary claims, was unanimously rejected
by the Court of Appeals. United States v. New Hampshire. 539
F.2d 277 (1st Cir. 1976).

         As to the probative value of statistical evidence, Attorney
General Souter incredibly claimed: "For a determination of an
individual's charge of an unlawful employment practice, group
statistics are not 'relevant.'" Brief at 14. Rejecting this
claim, the Court of Appeals observed that, to the contrary,
statistical workforce data in fact are "highly useful when an
agency or court attempts to make the often difficult inference
that illegal discrimination is or is not present in a particular

                                                        10
                                      444

factual context," 539 F.2d at 280; and the Court of Appeals cited
four other Courts of Appeals1 decisions all standing for the
still-extant evidentiary rule that in cases of alleged "'racial
discrimination, statistics often tell much, and Courts listen,1"
id. (citations omitted).8 Equally compelling if not more so at
this time -- except to Attorney General Souter -- were nearly
half-a-dozen Supreme Court decisions referencing the relevance of
statistical data in Title VII cases.9

         Having constructed his factual claim on a foundation of
sand, Attorney General Souter subsequently advanced as one of his
legal claims that Title VII's recordkeeping requirements could
only lead to the use of "quotas," making Title VII's
recordkeeping requirements themselves unconstitutional and hence
beyond congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Brief at 24, 37-45. The Court of Appeals dismissed
Attorney General Souter's foundation-of-sand "quotas" claim in
two cursory footnotes, 539 F.2d at 280 nn. 4 & 5; and easily
dismissed his lack-of-congressional-power assertion under Section
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 539 F.2d at 280-81, through

reliance on solid supreme Court: precedents commencing with Ex
Parte Virginia. 100 U.S. 339, 345 (1880), running through
Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384 U.S. 641, 648-51 (1966) (upholding the
constitutionality under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment of
Congress1 limited ban on literacy tests in the Voting Rights Act
of 1965), and most recently in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer. 427 U.S.
455 (1976) (unanimously upholding Congress1 power under § 5 of
the Fourteenth Amendment to make the states liable for monetary
remedies under Title VII).

        Apparently not content with arguing Title VII's
unconstitutionality only under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, Attorney General Souter also challenged at length the
constitutionality of Title VII under the Constitution's commerce
clause, as unauthorized "evidence of unchecked centralized
government." Brief at 29. This claim was rejected by the Court
of Appeals with little discussion in view of Title VII's obvious
constitutionality under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
539 F.2d at 281-82.10

        Apparently so as to leave no stone unturned in his crusade
to defeat proof of discrimination on grounds of national origin,
race, and gender, Attorney General Souter also asserted that
Title VII's recordkeeping requirements somehow also violated the
Tenth Amendment's reservation of power to the states, the

claim of unconstitutionality under the commerce clause was
entirely "beside the point, however, because Congress principally
relied on the fourteenth amendment when in 1972 it included
states within the purview of Title VII." 539 F.2d at 281.

rights of the state's employees to liberty, privacy, and due
process. Brief at 45-59. The Court of Appeals in a footnote
dismissed these claims as not even "deserving of discussion".
539 F.2d at 282 n. 6.

         Having been soundly trounced on appeal, Attorney General
Souter nevertheless zealously continued his attack on Title VII
and on congressional power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment
by filing with the Supreme Court a Petition for a Writ of
Certiorari. A mere three-page Memorandum in Opposition was filed
by Solicitor General Robert Bork. The Supreme Court denied
certiorari. New Hampshire v. United States. 429 U.S. 1023
(1976).

         B. Voting Rights
         Attorney General Souter's misunderstanding of -- or his
disagreement with -- congressional power under Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment in his challenge to the constitutionality of
Title VII is even more profound in view of the sound judicial
rejection of his virtually identical challenge to congressional
power six years earlier in United States v. New Hampshire. No.
3191 (D.N.H. Oct. 27, 1970) (three-judge court).
         This is the case -- listed in his Senate Questionnaire at 29
as one of the most significant cases he had ever handled -- in
which Assistant Attorney General Souter unsuccessfully challenged
Congress1 power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to

                                                        13
                                     447

ban literacy tests, as a prerequisite to voting, through Title II
of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970.11

        At the time that Assistant Attorney General Souter in the
fall of 1970 defended New Hampshire's literacy tests in this case
by challenging Congress1 power, four significant developments
affecting the right to vote had occurred in the previous decade,
significant developments which fundamentally changed this
nation's approach to suffrage. One such development was
Congress1 recognition of historical and continuing denials of the
right to vote on grounds of race and national origin, coupled
with Congress' enactment of highly creative remedies therefor
through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The other three
developments were judicial, involving the Supreme Court's
reiteration of congressional power under Section 2 of the
Fifteenth Amendment to remedy racial and national origin
discrimination in voting; the Supreme Court's reiteration of
congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment
to break down barriers to equality in general; and the Supreme
Court's entry into the political thicket of legislative
reapportionment to curtail vote dilution through the Court's
application of the one-person-one-vote principal under the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, coupled with the
Supreme Court's declaring unconstitutional various restrictions
on the right to vote. Because of the fact that all of these

developments in combination should have affected the approach
taken by any reasonable attorney to New Hampshire's literacy
tests and to congressional power in the fall of 1970 -- but did
not at all appear to affect the position taken that fall by
Assistant Attorney General Souter -- it may be useful here to
summarize initially each of these four developments which
together so substantially altered and improved our nation's new
commitment to the constitutional promise of equal protection
under law.

         1. Denial of the right to vote through practices such as
literacy tests, and dilution of a vote through myriad other
practices, not only have limited the franchise in our democracy
but also have historically disenfranchised Hispanics, African
Americans, and other minorities altogether. Based on an
extensive record of disenfranchisement, and based upon Congress1
intent to provide new and effective remedies therefor, Congress
initially enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and subsequently
extended and strengthened the Act in 1970, 1975, and 1982. As to
the initial 1965 Act, one section of the Act barred the use of
literacy tests in jurisdictions where Congress deemed the effects
of past discrimination to have been most severe; another section
of the 1965 Act barred the use of literacy tests in New York
without regard to any past discrimination whatsoever. Both
sections of the 1965 Act were challenged thereafter as an
unconstitutional exercise of congressional power.

         2. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach. 383 U.S. 301 (1966),

                                                        15
                                      449

the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of various
sections of the Voting Rights of 1965, including Section 4(a)
which temporarily suspended literacy tests in seven southern
states, in Alaska, and in various counties in Arizona, Hawaii,
and Idaho where such tests had been recently used and where voter
registration was low. Rejecting the contention that only the
judiciary could strike down state statutes and procedures, the
Supreme Court unanimously upheld Section 4(a) of the Act as an
appropriate exercise of Congress1 power under Section 2 of the
Fifteenth Amendment (which states that "Congress shall have power
to enforce this article by appropriate legislation").

         3. Several months later, in Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384 U.S.
641 (1966), the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of
Section 4(e) of the Act, through which Congress had suspended
English literacy tests for all persons educated through the sixth
grade in a language other than other English in American-flag
schools. Although Congress in enacting Section 4(e) had not
relied on the racially discriminatory effect of English literacy
tests, and although the use of such tests was not then forbidden
by the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause itself, the
Court in seven-to-two decision authored by Justice Brennan ruled
that Congress1 enactment of section 4(e) was "a proper exercise
of the powers granted to Congress by § 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment [which states that "The Congress shall have power to
enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article"]." 384 U.S. at 646 (footnote omitted, brackets added).

                                                        16
                                      450

In reaching this result, the Court relied on its holding in Ex
Parte Virginia. 100 U.S. 339, 345 (1880):

                  It is the power of Congress which has been
                  enlarged. Congress is authorized to enforce
                  the prohibitions by appropriate legislation.
                  Some legislation is contemplated to make the
                  amendments fully effective.
Katzenbach. 384 U.S. at 648, quoting Ex Parte Virginia. 100 U.S.
at 345 (emphasis in original). The Court also noted that its
fairly recent "decision in Lassiter v. Northampton Election
Board. 360 U.S. 45 (1959), sustaining the North Carolina English
literacy requirement as not in all circumstances prohibited by
the first sections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments is
inapposite" because Lassiter "did not present the question [of
congressional power] before us here." Katzenbach. 384 U.S. at
649. In other words, the recently sustained constitutionality of
literacy tests is irrelevant to congressional power under Section
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
         4. The final and arguably most profound development during
the decade was the Supreme Court's guarantee against
unconstitutional vote dilution under the Fourteenth Amendment
through application of the one-person-one-vote principle in
Reynolds v. Sims. 377 U.S. 533 (1964) (per Justice Brennan).
Additionally, and in part because of the Court's recognition in
Reynolds that the right to vote "is of the essence in a
democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at

                                                        17
                                      451

the heart of representative government," 377 U.S. at 555, the
Supreme Court thereafter began striking down as unconstitutional
under the Fourteenth Amendment numerous restrictions on the right
to vote. See, e.g.. Carrincrton v. Rash. 380 U.S. 89 (1965)
(state could not deny the right to vote to persons solely because
they were members of the armed services); Harper v. Virginia
Board of Elections. 383 U.S. 663 (1966) (persons unable to pay
poll fees could not be denied the right to vote); Kramer v. Union
School District. 395 U.S. 621 (1969) (bachelors cannot be barred
from voting in school board elections).

         Against this backdrop, Assistant Attorney General Souter, in
United States v. New Hampshire. No. 3191 (D.N.H. Oct. 27, 1970),
defended New Hampshire's literacy tests, which had been suspended
by Congress through Congress* nationwide suspension of literacy
tests in Title II of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970.
Important here is not so much the fact of his defense, but the
manner of it, as is set forth in his Memorandum of Law filed on
October 2 in opposition to the United States' motion for a
preliminary injunction.

         On the law, as noted, Assistant Attorney General Souter
challenged Congress1 suspension of literacy tests as beyond
Congress' power. Although he cited Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384
U.S. 641 (1966), nowhere in his Memorandum did he describe it,
much less analyze it. Instead, he claimed that New Hampshire's
literacy tests were constitutional on their face under Lassiter
v. Northampton Election Board. 360 U.S. 45 (1959) -- a case which

                                                        18
                                      452

the Supreme Court had held to be "inapposite" in Katzenbach. 384
U.S. at 649 -- and he incorrectly argued in the face of
Katzenbach that "authority is wanting for the proposition that a
blanket suspension of all literacy tests may be compelled by
Congressional legislation, absent the showing of correlation
between areas in which suspension is effected and areas in which
the tests have been used for ultimately unconstitutional
purposes." Memorandum at 4-6.

         Ignoring the constitutional dimensions of every adult
citizen's right to vote, Assistant Attorney General Souter
actually asserted that the "individuals [denied the right to
vote] can claim, therefore, no more than that they are the
fortuitous and incidental beneficiaries of a legal, rather than a
constitutional, right to vote"; that their right to vote is "of a
merely legal nature"; and that the right is "of a wholly
incidental legal nature." Memorandum at 8-9 (brackets added).
He also asserted, even more shockingly, that "allowing
illiterates [persons not literate in reading and writing English]
to make a choice in such matters is tantamount to authorizing
them to vote at random, utterly without comprehension," and that
"detriment to the state and its citizens will occur in watering
the value of every literate citizen's vote." Memorandum at 7-8
(brackets added).

         Assistant Attorney General Souter's narrow view of
congressional power was unanimously rejected by the three-judge
federal court. United States v. New Hampshire. No. 3191 (D.N.H.

                                                        19
                                      453

Oct. 27, 1970). Less than two months later, in an original-
jurisdiction action, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected
better formulated arguments and upheld Congress1 ban on English
literacy tests under either or both of Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.
Oregon v. Michel1. 400 U.S. 112 (1970).

         C. Affirmative Action
         Following his 1976 argument to the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit that Title VII's recordkeeping
requirements would lead to the unconstitutional imposition of
quotas, Attorney General Souter gave a commencement speech on May
30, 1976. Under a banner headline stating "Souter Raps Ethnic
Preferment" in the Manchester Union Leader the following day,
Attorney General Souter was quoted as characterizing affirmative
action as "affirmative discrimination," and stating that
government "should not be involved in this." "There are some
things government cannot do," he was reported to have said, "and
our whole Constitutional history is a history of restraining
power."
         In the years subsequent to his delivery of this speech, the
Supreme Court upheld as constitutional or otherwise as lawful
race-conscious affirmative action admissions to obtain diversity
in higher education, University of California v. Bakke. 438 U.S.
265 (1978); voluntarily adopted affirmative action goals and
timetables in employment to overcome minority

                                                        20
                                   454

underrepresentation, United Steelworkers of America v. Weber. 443
U.S. 193 (1979); see also Johnson v. Transportation Agency. Santa
Clara County. 480 U.S. 616 (1987) ; strict goals and timetables
ordered by courts to remedy past discrimination, United States v.
Paradise. 480 U.S. 149 (1987); and minority set-aside programs
authorized by Congress to alleviate underrepresentation,
Fullilove v. Klutznick. 448 U.S. 448 (1980).

III. Judge Souter, in His Testimony Before This Committee,
         Did Not Reveal Personal Positions Sufficient to Rebut
         His Record of Antagonism to Civil Rights

         Because of the fact that the first two of the three
foregoing incidents antagonistic to civil rights occurred when
Judge Souter was acting in his official capacity as lawyer-
advocate in the New Hampshire Office of Attorney General -- and
even aside from his oath of office and the excessive manner in
which he excessively pursued his positions hostile to civil
rights -- MALDEF withheld final judgment pending his testimony
before this Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

         Our hope was that maybe, just maybe, his personal positions
had been different from and more compassionate than the hostile
positions he had advanced in his official capacity on behalf of
the State of New Hampshire; and that he had been misquoted by the
media in his sound-bite characterization of affirmative action as
"affirmative discrimination." Our hope, however, was quickly
dashed by Judge Souter's own testimony in his first two days

                                                        21
                                      455

before this Committee. In summary, he repeatedly declined to
offer any personal views at the time contrary to the hostile
positions -- to civil rights in general, and to Congress1 power
under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in particular -- he
had aggressively pursed on behalf of the State of New Hampshire.
And, maybe even worse, Judge Souter failed to demonstrate any
capacity for fairness to, much less compassion for, the
individuals who would be forever affected by his rulings and
votes as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

         This is not to deny and certainly not to degrade the
testimony he gave finally recognizing that still today there is
an enormous need to remedy the wrongs done by our nation and
within our nation through a history of invidious discrimination.
For example, under questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy, Judge
Souter to his credit testified:

                           I hope one thing will be clear and this
                  is maybe the time to make it clear, and that
                  is that with respect to the societal problems
                  of the United States today there is none
                  which, in my judgment, is more tragic or more
                  demanding of the efforts of every American in
                  the Congress and out of the Congress than the
                  removal of societal discrimination in matters
                  of race and in the matters of invidious
                  discrimination which we are unfortunately too
                  familiar with.

                           That, I hope, when these hearings are
                  over, will be taken as given with respect to
                  my set of values.
Hearing Transcript at 150 (Sept. 13, 1990). And, during his
testimony the following day in response to questioning by Senator
Paul Simon about Attorney General Souter's reported
characterization of affirmative action as "affirmative
discrimination," Judge Souter testified that he hoped he hadn't
been quoted exactly:

                           I think that -- I hope that was not the
                  exact quote because I don't believe that.
                  The kind of discrimination that I was talking
                  about in the speech was discrimination, as I
                  described it and as I recall being quoted in
                  the paper about it, a discrimination in the
                  sense that benefits were to be distributed
                  according to some formula of racial
                  distribution, have nothing to do with any
                  remedial purpose but simply for the sake of
                  reflecting a racial distribution.
Hearing Transcript at 111 (Sept. 14, 1990). Judge Souter
continued:

                          That is to be contrasted in two
                  absolutely essential respects, from on the
                  one hand affirmative action and on the other
                 hand the kind of distributive remedy which it

                                                        23
                        457

is appropriate for courts and, to a degree
yet to be fully developed, appropriate for
Congress to consider.

         I would suppose it would go without
saying today that if we are in the United
States to have the kind of society which I
described yesterday as the society which I
knew or found reflected in my home, there
will be a need -- and I am afraid for a
longer time that we would like to say -- a
need for the affirmative action which seeks
out qualified people who have been
discouraged by generations of societal
discrimination from taking their place in the
mainstream and in all of America and in all
the distribution of its benefits and its
burdens. That is an obligation of
individuals, and it is an obligation of
government.

         I think it also goes without saying that
when we consider the power of the judiciary
to remedy discrimination which has been
proven before the judiciary, the appropriate
response is not simply to say stop doing it.
The appropriate response, wherever it is
possible, is to say undo it. That is a

                                      24
                                    458

                  judicial obligation to make good on the
                  Fourteenth Amendment.

                           And as I said a moment ago, one of the
                  developments in American constitutional law
                  which is at the stage, I would say, of
                  exploration now is to the development about -
                  the particular power of Congress to address a
                  general societal discrimination as opposed to
                  a specific remedy for a specific
                  discrimination. That is a concern which will
                  be played out in constitutional litigation
                  for some time ahead of us.
Hearing Transcript at 111-13 (Sept. 14, 1990).
         Although the foregoing testimony constitutes a fairly
accurate summary of the constitutionally and legally permissible
scope of affirmative action allowed under current Supreme Court
rulings, nowhere in his testimony did Judge Souter deny the
characterizations reported in his 1976 speech, and in fact almost
nowhere did Judge Souter refer to his own views of affirmative
action either as a constitutional matter, or as a matter of
statutory construction or of congressional power. All that Judge
Souter has left with us with any certainty is that these are
matters "which will be played out in constitutional litigation
for some time ahead of us." Hearing Transcript at 113. But for
those of "us" who are Hispanic and female, this is not just an
intellectual game to be "played out."

                                                        25
                                     459

        More troublesome, indeed determinative for MALDEF, has been
Judge Souter's repeated refusals -- after repeated opportunities
-- to distance his personal views, as possibly compassionate on
civil rights and as more deferential to Congress' power under
Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, from the extreme and cold
positions he advanced as an Assistant Attorney General and as
Attorney General challenging Congress* ban on literacy tests for
voting as unconstitutional, and challenging Congress's Title VII
recordkeeping requirements as unconstitutional.

         In Judge Souter's opening statement before this Committee,-
he said nothing at all about civil rights, and nothing at all
concerning the powers of Congress under Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Hearing Transcript at 93-100 (Sept. 13,
1990).

         Judge Souter, on the other hand, did readily concede that
one of the lessons learned by him as a trial judge -- a lesson
that is readily apparent to anyone who has ever been before a
trial judge -- was that "at the end of our [judicial] task some
human being is going to be affected." Hearing Transcript at 99
(Sept. 13, 1990).

         Judge Souter's personal views on civil rights were inquired
into thereafter by several Senators, but Judge Souter refused to
disclose his personal beliefs or positions. For example, Senator
Kennedy pointedly asked Judge Souter:

                           Did you agree with the position of the
                  State of New Hampshire that it is

                                                        26
                                     460

                  unconstitutional for Congress to require
                  employers to provide statistics about racial
                  composition of the workforce?
Hearing Transcript at 141-42 (Sept. 13, 1990). Judge Souter
declined to state his personal position, stating instead only:
"I did not know whether it was unconstitutional or not." Hearing
Transcript at 142 (Sept. 13, 1990). As to Judge Souter's
personal views about Congress' power under Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, Judge Souter again provided no such
personal views but instead -- despite the Supreme Court's
seemingly definitive ruling in Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384 U.S. 641
(1966) -- stated that to him there was "probably no question that
there will be further years of litigation before the exact limits
of that power are defined." Hearing Transcript at 142 (Sept. 13,
1990).
         Pursuing a follow-up question to try to learn about Judge
Souter's personal views, Senator Kennedy again quite pointedly
asked:

                           So, did you at the time formulate any
                  personal view about the legitimacy of the
                  Congress in attempting to root out
                  discrimination in the workplace?
Hearing Transcript at 143 (Sept. 13, 1990). Despite the
opportunity again provided to Judge Souter to distinguish his
possibly compassionate personal views from those he over-
zealously had advocated on behalf of the State of New Hampshire,

                                                        27
                                     461

Judge Souter instead coldly replied that he had come "to no
comprehensive view of Section 5 at that time." Hearing
Transcript at 143 (Sept. 13, 1990).12

         With regard to Judge Souter's arguments defending the
literacy tests and again challenging Congress1 power under
Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Judge Souter in his
testimony again refused to give his personal views, and also
declined to recognize the practical effect of maintaining
literacy tests. Hearing Transcript at 147-51 (Sept. 13, 1990).
As to the practical effect, the most compassionate response that
Judge Souter could summon was that: "There is some question as
to what its practical effect was in those days." Hearing
Transcript at 151 (Sept. 13, 1990). As to the governing law
applicable at the time flowing from the Supreme Court's decision
in Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384 U.S. 641 (1966), which validated
Congress1 power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,
Judge Souter most inappropriately and misleadingly stated in his

12. Interestingly, although Judge Souter refused to distance his
personal view from the legal position he had advanced in 1976 to
strip Congress of its powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, he indicated a lack of knowledge about the relevant
facts of the case even at that time. For example, Senator
Kennedy asked:

                           Tell me, why did you file information
                  with regard to gender in employment ... but
                  not with regards to race?

Hearing Transcript at 146 (Sept. 13, 1990). To this question,
Judge Souter responded, id. at 147:

                           If you were to ask me cold whether the
                  State was filing gender information at that
                  time, I could not have told you.

test: imony, Ad.:

                           There was one thing that we did know
                  very clearly about the law in those days, and
                  that was that the use of a literacy test for
                  a non-discriminatory purpose was
                  constitutional under the Fourteenth
                  Amendment.
         Judge Souter, in his second day of testimony and again under
questioning by Senator Kennedy, showed himself to be even more
hostile to civil rights than he had previously proved. Hearing
Transcript at 182-208 (Sept. 14, 1990). For example, with regard
to Judge Souter's aggressive litigation attacks challenging the
unconstitutionality of Title VII's recordkeeping requirements and
of the Voting Rights Act Amendments' nationwide ban on the use of
literacy tests for voting, Senator Kennedy asked:

                           What I would like to ask you is whether
                  you formed any personal view when you were
                  preparing those cases. Did you form any
                  personal view about the rightfulness or
                  wrongfulness?
Hearing Transcript at 190-91 (Sept. 14, 1990). Judge Souter
dodged this question yet again. In fact, eschewing any personal
views, opinions, or even responsibilities, Judge Souter ducked
behind his often-asserted advocacy mantle, stating in part: "Our
responsibility in those circumstances is the responsibility to be

                                                        29
                                     463

the best advocates that we can." Hearing Transcript at 191
(Sept. 14, 1990).

         Desiring at least a semblance of a personal response,
Senator Kennedy pressed the point. He reminded Judge Souter of
the testimony the day before in which Judge Souter had stated
that in judicial decision making, "at the end of our task some
human being is going to be affected," Hearing Transcript at 99
(Sept. 13, 1990); and Senator Kennedy thereupon asked whether
Judge Souter had ever weighed the negative impact upon Hispanics,
African Americans, and women in his personal views while
challenging the constitutionality of Title VII's recordkeeping
requirements and of the Voting Right Act Amendments' suspension
of literacy tests, Hearing Transcript at 191-92 (Sept. 14, 1990).
The best -- any yet worst -- answer that Judge Souter could
master was to deny any different personal views: "Senator, I
doubtless formed an opinion, but the opinion was related to the
case that I was arguing," whereupon Judge Souter again lapsed
into another defense of his them-and-now-meritless challenges to
congressional power. Hearing Transcript at 192 (Sept. 14, 1990) .

         Pressed yet again by Senator Kennedy -- this time as to
whether Judge Souter's unsuccessful arguments had been wrong, and
whether the judiciary's rejections of his arguments had meant
that "the right result was achieved" -- Judge Souter finally
conceded that "the right result for the Nation was, indeed,
achieved." Hearing Transcript at 192-92 (Sept. 14, 1990). But
he refused to say that he "agreed" with any of the court

                                                         30
                                     464

decisions rejecting his challenges to congressional power under
Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hearing Transcript at 193
(Sept. 14, 1990).

         Finally, under even more questioning, Judge Souter at last
made the minor concession that under today's Supreme Court
precedents recognizing Congress* power under Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, "I think today the outcome [in each case]
is right." Hearing Transcript at 194 (emphasis and brackets
added). But what about tomorrow? Indeed, what about tomorrow if
Justice Souter is recommended by this Committee for confirmation
by the Senate as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court?

         Apart from Judge Souter's overall nonresponsiveness in his
two days of testimony -- much less his apparently continuing
hostility to the Supreme Court's for-now recognition of Congress'
power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and under
Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment -- the fact of the matter is
that, although provided with plentiful opportunities to do so,
Judge Souter has not demonstrated fairness for or any compassion
about those of us (particularly Hispanics, African Americans, and
women) who for so long have been denied not just the promise of
the American dream, but more basically the equal protection of
the laws.

         In addition to Judge Souter's nonresponsiveness, his evident
lack of feeling and of compassion, and his continued hostility to
Congress1 current power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, there is yet another fact that this Committee and the

                                                        31
                                     465

full Senate need to bear in mind. This fact pertains to Judge
Souter's admiration, from among all Supreme Justices, of not the
first Justice Harlan but of the second Justice Harlan. Please,
please remember that the philosophies of the these two jurists
were leagues apart.

        The first Justice Harlan, now often remembered only for one
historical dissenting opinion, provided the Supreme Court's sole
dissent in Plessv v. Ferguson. 163 U.S. 537, 552-64 (1896).
This, alas, is not the Justice Harlan who Judge Souter admires.
Instead, Judge Souter admires most among all Supreme Court
Justices the second Justice Harlan, who wrote the dissenting
opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan. 384 U.S. 641, 659-71 (1966),
expressing the view that Congress essentially has no power
whatsoever to legislate under Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment different from or beyond that already deemed to be
unconstitutional by the judiciary.

                                                 CONCLUSION

        Judge David H. Souter has not demonstrated fairness to or
even compassion for racial minorities, particularly with regard
to our trying to win nondiscriminatory opportunities to equal
employment; and to our most fundamental right under the
Constitution and the laws of our country, the right to vote.

        MALDEF accordingly opposes the confirmation of David H.
Souter as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Hernandez.
  Mr. Rauh, welcome.

                    STATEMENT OF JOSEPH L. RAUH
  Mr. RAUH. Thank you, sir.
  The leadership conference organizations range from those for-
mally opposed to Judge Souter's confirmation to those deeply trou-
bled. The importance of this cannot be exaggerated. The Court has
reached the stage where one more conservative or reactionary Jus-
tice will create a serious problem for the Bill of Rights.
  We ask, the leadership conference is unanimous in this request,
that the record be left open for a significant time and that Judge
Souter be called back for further questioning. I will now in the
short time available try to give you as much understanding of the
new material that we have in this case.
  On page 198 of the transcript, Judge Souter makes a remarkable
statement that we definitely challenge. This is the statement: "The
State of New Hampshire does not have racial problems." Let me
say that again. What he said was, "The State of New Hampshire
does not have racial problems."
  Now, let me make perfectly clear to you that I am not blaming
Judge Souter for the racial problems. It is a fact that judge of the
Supreme Court ought not be one who cannot see what is right
under his nose: the terrible racial problems in New Hampshire. It
is not that it is worse than anything else. It is just as bad as any-
thing else. It is not that--I am not saying that Judge Souter did it.
I am saying that he has shown such an insensitivity to it. He has
done nothing about it. He has over and over again tried to brush it
under the rug. Indeed, it is even worse than that. He said that was
his justification for refusing information on racial breakdown. It is
connection with that that he said we do not have it. He repeated
that.
  Now, if you want that insensitive a man on that Court, why, I
am only one citizen. But I tell you that the most frightening thing
is to put people on that Court who have no sensitivity to the race
problem in this country.
  Let me just show you some of the things about New Hampshire.
There are only two States in the Union that don't have a King hol-
iday. One is Montana. One is New Hampshire, and they have had
fights over and over again.
  Mr. Chairman, I hope that the documents I am going to show
you here can be put into the record, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, they will.

_ 1 the question, David Souter, are you a racist?

2   Judge Souter. The answer is, no.

3   Senator Simpson. A crazy question to ask, is it not?

4   Judge Souter. Well, far be it for me to say that a

    question from you, Senator, is crazy.

6   [Laughter.]

7   Senator Simpson. No, do not. Just stop right there.

    Senator Hatch. But we all agree.

9   Senator Simpson. Do not listen to them, just go ahead

10  Judge Souter. In a way, I think that answer might have

11 been impressive to some people if I had grown up in a place

12 with racial problems, and some people have pointed out that I

13 did not. The State of New Hampshire does not have racial

15  So you can ask, well, what indication is there, really,

16 as to whether you mean it or not. And you did not provoke

17 this thinking on my part by your question immediately because

18 I thought of it before I came in here. I can think of two

19 things to say.

20  The first is something very personal and very specific

21 to my family. In a way, it surprises me when I look back on

22 the years when I was growing up that never once, ever in my

23 house that I can remember did I ever hear my mother or my

24 father refer to any human being in terms of racial or ethnic

25 identity. I have heard all tHe slang terms and I never heard

  BODY:
       The New Hampshire Supreme Court has upheld a state Commission on Human

Rights' decision that a New Hampshire construction company discriminated
against a worker because he was black.

     In a three to one vote Friday the court ruled in favor of a suit filed by
Leonard Briscoe. The court ordered E.D. Swett Inc. to pay Briscoe $2,338.56 in
back wages and $750 in attorney's fees.

     Briscoe had filed suit with the commission after he was passed over for work
on a 1979 project in Lisbon. Briscoe said that he had worked for Swett before,
and was qualified to do the work. The company instead hired three workers who
they had not employed before, although the company had a policy of giving
preference to former workers.

     Officials of the commission said Friday they are pleased to have won one of
the few discrimination cases to have come before the state's courts.

      11 The commission's general way of evaluating discrimination cases has been
upheld here,'1 said Merryl Gibbs, the commission's executive director.

     The commission had originally awarded Briscoe $1,000 in compensatory damages
in addition to the money awarded by the court. The decision not to award the
compensatory damages was the basis for the lone dissenting opinion.

     Justice Charles Douglass wrote in his decision, ''Pecuniary loss and mental
anguish can be the effects of discrimination. The award of compensatory
damages will serve to eliminate the effects of discrimination, prevent future

  discriminatory practices, and ensure that victims of unlawful discrimination
are made whole.''

KEYWORD: Nh-Thomson

 BODY:
       Eormer Gov. Meldnm Thomson, just back from a trip to South Africa, said

Monday Bishop Desmond Tutu is willing to embrace communism to end the white
minority rule of his racially torn nation.

     The ultra-conservative Thomson, who toured South Africa for 17 days last
month, said he met with the Nobel Prize winner in Cape Town and Tutu said he was
more interested in full political power for blacks rather than just eliminating
apartheid.

      ''Tutu doesn't have any trouble socializing with communists and I think he
rather likes it,'1 Thomson said in a telephone interview from his home in
Orford. He said the religious leader would risk civil war and communist
intervention to bring full power to the nation's black majority.

     Thomson returned from South Africa and went directly to Washington last
week to lobby against U.S. economic sanctions. He said South African blacks
oppose the sanctions, which survived a presidential veto.

      ''They know they will lose their jobs,11 Thomson said. ''We're nuts. They
have been our friends and allies since World War Two.''

        Thomson said the South African government had made ''tremendous strides
   toward eliminating apartheid'' since his visit in 1978, when he was serving his
- third term as governor.

     Thomson, 74, who once ordered state flags lowered on Good Friday, stirred
controversy during his first trip to South Africa when he described the black
ghetto of Soweto as a ''wonderful place'' and proclaimed Prime Minister John
Vorster a ''great world statesman.1'

     He said his latest tour found ''marked improvement'' in black housing. He
also said blacks' rights and working conditions had improved.

    Thomson said coal-to-oil converting plants and uranium mines offered
11 fabulous,'' high-paying jobs for black South Africans.

                    He described the poverty-stricken Cross Roads section of Cape Town as
               ''rather terrible,'1 but said the government was working hard to provide food
               and medical services for black residents.

                     In his weekly Monday column in The Union Leader newspaper of Manchester,
               Thomson said South Africa needed patience and understanding, not the ''dirty
               game'' economic sanctions approved by Congress last week.

                    He described South Africa as a ''peaceful, hard-working little nation of
               less than 30 million.1'

                    Thomson said he financed his own trip to South Africa. He represented the
               Conservative Caucus in his 1978 tour, which was financed by a group of South
               African businesses.

Thomson-Carter

 BODY:
     Gov. Meldrim Thomson accused President Carter of making a "false statement"

about Thomson's position on South Africa and demanded an apology Sunday.

     In an open letter to the president, who visited New Hamsphire on Saturday,
the conservative Republican governor challenged the administration to a debate
on U.S. policy concerning South Africa.

     Carter, addressing high school pupils in Nashua on Saturday, had said Thomson
is "the only American leader that I know who has endorsed, in effect, apartheid
and condoned or approved the attitude of the South African government."

     Thomson, national chairman of the Conservative Caucus, recently toured
white-ruled South Africa. He praised the government of Prime Minister John
Vorster and said South African blacks have more economic and political freedom
than blacks in other African nations.

     "I have never endorsed, condoned or approved apartheid, and no one in America
can point to a word that I have ever written or said that would give that
impression," Thomson said in his open letter to Carter. "In the American spirit
of fair play and decency, I respectfully call on you to retract your false
reference to me."

     Rex Granum, deputy press secretary to Carter, said Sunday that the president
"stands by what he said. I would further direct you to other comments the
president made . . . when he said, "There are very few matters upon which your
governor and I agree.'"

HEADLINE: Jackson seeks meeting with ultra-conservative

DATELINE: WARNER, N.H.

KEYWORD: Nh-Jackson-newhamp

 BODY:
       Jesse Jackson's supporters pressed Friday for a meeting between the

Democratic presidential hopeful and a state senator who publicly told a racial
joke about Jackson.

     Sen. John H.P. Chandler, whose racial comments cost him his honorary position
with the presidential campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y-, said he saw no need to
meet Jackson Sunday night when the candidate comes to the state to formally
announce his candidacy.

     Chandler, who is white, described the proposed meeting as an attempt to draw
news media attention to Jackson's campaign.

      ''We still are trying,11 Steve Cancian, Jackson's New Hampshire
coordinator, said of efforts to have the two men meet. He said the meeting idea
originated with New Hampshire supporters and was accepted by Jackson.

      ··I think our true intent is a reconciliation,'1 Cancian said Friday from the
campaign's Manchester headquarters.

      ·'Jesse Jackson would not change 80 years of Jack Chandler's thoughts,
but they can reach some understanding,11 Cancian said. ''It's a sincere effort
on the part of Jesse Jackson.

     1'Part of Jesse Jackson's message is people can always talk to each other,''
Cancian added.

* _ . Chandler, 76, who could not be reached Friday at his Warner home, told the
     Jackson joke at several public events during the summer. He later was quoted as
     saying that he almost ''threw up'' when he saw Jackson kiss a young white girl.

           In an interview Thursday, Chandler said of the kissing incident, lfI wasn't
. actually sick to my stomach.''

           flI have got a very strong stomach, but I didngt like seeing him (Jackson)
     kiss a pretty young woman with blond hair and a peaches and cream complexion,1'
     Chandler was quoted as saying by The Union Leader newspaper.

                    Asked if he considered himself a racist, Chandler said, " I an loyal to the
               race I am a member of, like Indians and black men are loyal to their race.11

                    Chandler, a Republican, has enraged his critics with his ultra-conservative
               views. He has led the fight in New Hampshire against a holiday for Martin
               Luther King Jr., calling the slain civil rights leader an ''evil man.1'

                      The joke Chandler told about Jackson was: ''Jesse Jackson has stopped
               running for president because it was found out that his grandmother had posed
               for the centerfold of National Geographic.1'

       BODY:
          The presidential campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) last week removed New

       Hampshire state Sen. John Chandler Jr. as an honorary county chairman in the
     campaign when he refused to repudiate or apologize for what he said was a joke
     he told about Jesse L. Jackson.

          "Not only wouldn't he apologize," said Kemp press secretary John Buckley, "he
     then wouldn't resign."

. .  Chandler said he still will support Kemp, but added, "I'm not going to

     apologize for anything I said because this is a free country . . . . I believe I

     have a right to express my opinion."

          What Chandler said at various public events last month was that "Jesse
     Jackson has stopped running for president because it was found out that his
     grandmother had posed for the centerfold of National Geographic."

          Chandler, who denies he is a racist, also has complained that "race mixing"
     is threatening the white race.

          "We feel there's no room for that in our campaign," said Paul Young, director
     of Kemp's campaign in New Hampshire, although he did not disavow Chandler's
     support.

          Young said Kemp, who earlier repudiated Chandler's remarks, demanded the
     apology last week after he was told Chandler had not made one.

HEADLINE: Rights nominee's company cited in past

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

KEYWORD: Nh-Discnminate

  BODY:
       The construction company of a nominee to New Hampshire's human rights

commission previously has been found guilty by the same panel of discriminating
against a black construction worker.

       Richard H. Cole, who is president of E.D. Swett Inc., was nominated
Wednesday by Gov. John Sununu to the New Hampshire Commission for Human

 Rights.

     In January 1983, the state Supreme Court upheld a decision by the human
rightscomcnission against E.D. Swett. The court ruled 3-1 that E.D. Swett was
guilty of discriminating against Leonard Briscoe, who had been passed over for a
job on a 1979 project in Lisbon.

     Briscoe, who was awarded $2,3338 in back pay and $750 in attorney's fees,
said the company hired three workers with no experience. He said he had worked
for E.D. Swett before and was qualified to do the work.

E.D. Swett had a policy of giving preference to former workers.

     Sununu said he had been informed of the past racial discrimination complaint
and was investigating it.

     ''Obviously, I am concerned that both the reality and perception of the
fairness of the human rights commission be maintained,'' Sununu said in a
statement. ''If the record is verified, then I will withdraw the nomination.''

" " Swett could not immediately be reached at his home in Bow or at his
  construction company.

     The Executive Council is scheduled to consider the nomination at its next
meeting in early September.

     The rights commission investigates complaints of sexual or racial
discrimination. It was not clear when the panel ruled on the Briscoe complaint.

HEADLINE: Discrimination ruling forces withdrawal of rights nominee

BYLINE: By RICHARD MARCH

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

KEYWORD: Nh-Sununu

 BODY:
       Admitting he made a mistake, Gov. John Sununu said Wednesday he will

withdraw his human rights panel nominee whose construction firm was found
guilty of discriminating against a black worker.

     Sununu also said his nomination of state university system trustee Max Hugel
is on hold pending the outcome of an attorney general's investigation into
accusations that Hugel associated with a reputed organized crime figure.

      Richard H. Cole, president of E.D. Swett Inc., was nominated last week by
Sununu to the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights.

     The commission previously ruled that E.D. Swett was guilty of discriminating
against Leonard Briscoe, who had been passed over for a job on a 1979 project in
Lisbon. The state Supreme Court upheld the commission's decision in January
1983.

     Sununu said his administration never ''made the connection'' between the
discrimination ruling and his human rights nominee. He said Cole had been
contacted and the nomination would be officially withdrawn Sept. 4. when Sununu
meets with the Executive Council.

     ''We made a mistake there,'' Sununu told reporters. ''In that particular
case, we missed the lawsuit.''

     Sununu said Cole is a ''good person'1 of ''solid character,11 but ''the
perception of that commission is that it has to be fair.1'

     In a letter to Sununu, former commission member Nancy Richard -Stower said
 Cole's nomination sent a message that ''John Sununu cares not one iota about
the enforcement of New Hampshire's laws against discrimination."

     Sununu said Attorney General Stephen Merrill and state safety officials are
conducting ''an infomial review'' of charges that Hugel associated with George
Kattar at a televised boxing match at Hugel's Rockingham Park in April 1985.

                    Kattar, 67, who has homes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, is awaiting
               trial on federal extortion charges. Kattar was convicted of tax evasion in 1970.

                    Four men, including Sen. Robert Stephen, D-Manchester, and state highway
               safety official Jay McDuffee, have said Hugel introduced them to Kattar. Hugel
               has denied that.

                    Sununu said one aspect of his administration's investigation will focus on
               whether federal authorities have a record of Kattar's whereabouts on the night
               the introductions allegedly occurred.

                     ''I'm trying to get that,1' Sununu said.

                    Sununu said he had no idea when Merrill would finish his investigation into
               the incident and Hugel's nomination would remain ''on hold1' until Sununu has
               results. He said he would then decide whether to continue with Hugel's
               nomination.

                     ''There's a man's lifetime reputation at stake there,'' Sununu said.

                    Asked whether the Huyel allegations were politically motivated, Sununu said
               the election year ''makes people bring forward things. I don't know if that's
               the particular case in this instance,1' Sununu said.

                    Republican Executive Councilor and congressional candidate Louis Georgopoulos
               delayed Hugel's nomination vote last week because of the alleged Kattar-Hugel
               connection.

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, N.H.

KEYWORD: NH-KINGDAY

  BODY:
     An organizer of an effort to establish a Martin Luther King holiday in New

  Hampshire said Tuesday that a vote for a local King holiday in Portsmouth will
encourage the Legislature to take similar action.

       New Hampshire and Montana are the only two states that do not observe the
third Monday in January as a holiday to honor the slain civil rights leader.
Half-a-dozen attempts to pass a King holiday bill in the New Hampshire
Legislature have failed and supporters have turned their attention to
municipalities and school districts.

       Portsmouth City Council approved the King holiday Monday night on an 8-1
vote.

       ''I think it's very helpful,11 said Arnie Alpert of the Martin Luther King
Day Committee. ''It will serve as a reminder to the state that the issue has not
gone away and will be back in the next legislative session. There will be
increasing national attention on New Hampshire. ''

       Alpert cited a planned Ku KLux Klan rally in Exeter and the sale of
Nazi paraphernalia at the Cheshire County Fair last week as examples to show
that racism still exists.

1'That makes King Day more important for us,11 he said.

       King Day will be a paid holiday in the Portsmouth School District next year
and for all Portsmouth city employees in 1992.

       This year the King holiday was celebrated in 35 New Hampshire school
districts and in the cities of Dover and Nashua. Alpert said more school
districts will celebrate the holiday in 1991.

       Monday night's vote prompted a standing ovation among the 100 City Hall
spectators.

       The measure to establish King Day as a city holiday was introduced by
Assistant Mayor James Splaine, who introduced the first King holiday bill in the
Legislature when he was a senator.

KEYWORD: NH-RACISM

      BODY:
          Organizers of an upcoming ''Race Unity Day'1 have turned down the request of

    a Ku Klux Klansman who wanted to recruit town residents to his white supremacist
- group during the annual event.

            ''The sole purpose of Race Unity Day is to focus on proclaiming the oneness
    of humankind,'' said Jonathan Ring, secretary of the Exeter spiritual assembly
    of the Baha'i Faith, which is organizing the event next Sunday. The Baha'i Faith
    preaches the family of Man and world peace, Ring said.

            State KKK leader, or ''Grand Dragon,11 Thomas Herman, 29, ran unsuccessfully
    for selectman in Exeter·s March election. He came in last among five candidates
    with 145 votes of 2,651 ballots cast.

       11 In Exeter, this is a particularly attractive issue,'' Ring said. ''The
Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has forced the issue
to attention in our community.''

       Herman has been seen trying to recruit Klan members in Exeter, a blue-collar
town of about 13,000 people and home of the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy.

       About a week ago, Ring said, Herman asked to set up a display table on Race
Unity Day next to presentations by groups such as the National Association For
the Advancement of Colored People.

            Ring turned him down. ''Only tables which accentuate positive steps are
' _ permitted,'' Ring said.

       Herman said he and other Klan members will show up anyway and distribute
literature.

       ''They are discriminating against us,'1 Herman said. " I am definitely going
to be there.''

     -Although Herman says he he will not start any trouble, a town official is
worried about potential clashes.

HEADLINE: News Focus: Rights commission faces complaint crunch

BYLINE: By JACQUELINE HUARD

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

KEYWORD: Nh-Rights

  BODY:
       The New Hampshire Human Rights Commission is handling a record number of

complaints, and a serious backlog will develop without a permanent third
investigator, the executive director said Thursday.

     Gov. John H. Sununu and the Executive Council last week approved a nearly
$62,000 federal Housing and Urban Development grant for a two-year project to
educate the public about housing discrimination.

     The commission is using part of the money to hire a third investigator for
one year. Director Merryl Gibbs said she will ask the Legislature to make the
position permanent.

      ''Two investigators is simply not enough,'' she said. ''Without a third
investigator, we are going to be running into very serious backlogs.'1

     The commission enforces all state laws prohibiting discrimination in
employment, housing and public accommodation, and all federal laws prohibiting

  discrimination in employment and housing.

     There were 197 formal complaints filed with the commission in fiscal 1981;
164 in fiscal 1982; and Ms. Gibbs expects 216 for fiscal 1983 -- a record
number of discrimination complaints for the agency.

At the end of May, there were 247 complaints pending.

     The high number of complaints can be attributed to an improvement in the
economy, she said. The drop off in fiscal 1982 occurred when the economy was
faltering.

     ''People were just not willing to rock the boat,11 Ms. Gibbs said.

     A person filing a complaint with the commission will have the dispute
assigned to an investigator within two days to two weeks. A fact finding
conference for both parties will be scheduled within six weeks to be held at a
future date.

                    Although most complaints are settled within three to four months, a few rare
               and complicated cases could take two to three years, Ms. Gibbs said.

                    More than 50 percent of the complaints are settled through negotiation before
               a hearing is held. The person who filed the complaint usually will get what they
               consider is most important -- a job, back wages, a raise, promotion, or a policy
               change -- but generally not complete relief, she said.

                     ''But, I will not agree to settlements which will allow the discriminatory
               practice to continue,1' Ms. Gibbs said.

                    Sex discrimination complaints alleging unequal treatment in hiring, firing,
               layoffs, wages, promotions, working conditions, as well as claims of sexual
               harassment and discrimination against pregnant women continue to make up the
               bulk of complaints, she said.

                    Persons who believe they have been discriminated against because of age or
               physical handicap are filing more complaints. There also is a small increase in
               allegations of discrimination based on race and national origin, she said.

                    There are dangers in delaying investigations. Witnesses may move or die.
               Memories fail. Documents may become lost. Damages sought by the complainant pile
               up.

                     ''And the burden on the staff can become tremendous,'' Ms. Gibbs said.

Dear Sir:

We the Minority Students at Daniel Webster College in Nashua,
New Hampshire are terrified and fear for our safety and lives;
by the threats, verbal abuses and harassments that are made on
us daily by fellow students and members of the college's
administration. (principally Fred Schatz, Dean of Students).

These harassments range from students dressing as members of
the Klu Klux Klan, walking around the college yelling, "We
don't want your Jod/id around here," to the breaking, entering
and destruction of our rooms and personal properties. The
slurs K.K.K. and NIGGER SUCKS are frequently written on the
walls of our rooms. We are calling on you as responsible
authorities to investigate on behalf of us to help uphold our
Constitutional Rights as citizens of the United States of
America, and Foreign Students.

Thank you for your help in this matter.

Sincerely Yours,

(25 s ignatures)

                                                       3 April 1979

To whom it may concern:
         I am a student at Daniel Webster College who is concerned

about the recurring incidents of racial discrimination. A
number of black students have suffered verbal abuse from white
students. The only two black women living on campus have
suffered verbal abuse, vandalism, and burgulary of their
rooms. They have been humiliated in front of their fellow
students. There is no reason why anyone should be subjected to
such harassment.

         My major concern (and I am sure many other minority
students feel this way) is that if incidents such as these go
untreated, then trouble makers will not think twice before
causing disruptive incidents such as these in the future.

                                                      Respectfully,

                         called it "modern racism.'9

                            "We are deeply troubled by what
                         we perceive as a rising intolerance in
                         the nation,'1 said Arnold Alpert of
                         the New Hampshire American
                         Friends Service Committee.

                            The resolution- urging New

                         civilized side of modern American
                         racism," Alpert told the House
                         State-Federal Relations Committee.
                         He compared it to attempts by the
                         Ku Kiux Klan to stifle support for
                         racial equality.

                           Those who indicated opposition --
                         either by speaking or in writing --
                         outnumbered supporters 4-1.

                           Supporters argued it is essential to
                         national security and to ensure

       Chandler: resign

                Jack Chandler's Latest outrage
             must be answered. His blatant rac-
             ism is not only a disgrace and em-
             barrassment to the constituents he
             (theoretically) represents, but also
             to the state of New Hampshire.

                 His 'repulsion" of a black man
             kissing a white girl and his disbe-
             lief in "race mixing" reeks of pre-
             Civil War bigotry and is in concert
             with the thinking of members of
             present-day racist organizations
             such as the Order and the Ku Klux
             Klan.

                 I disassociate myself from my
             "'representative," as I'm sure all
             civil people do, and respectfully
            . suggest that he excuse himself
             from public office His credibility
             as an effective senator was dis-
             missed years ago by his peers, and
             znw be bas exposed to the rest of
             us histotallack of human decency.
             Barring his own resignation, at
             best should be soundly defeated in
             any future attempts to hold any po-
             sition that allows bun to represent
             more than just himself.

       Mistaken belief

                 I think it is very sad that a man
             like Jack Chandler represents New
             Hampshire. He perpetuates the
             mistaken belief that people from
             this state are ignorant and back-
             wards. He is a racist -- nothing
             more, nothing less.

                 If Jack Kemp really opposes
             Chandler's statements, let's see
             some action -- replace him as hon-
             orary chairman.

Swastika,

Slur Painted

On Temple

   Someone spray-painted a swastika and
the words "blood drinkers" on the roof of
the Temple Beth Jacob on Broadway Sun-
day night

   Rabbi Robert Schenkerman said mem-
bers of the temple were shocked and out-
raged.

   "It's something that belongs back in the
days of the Holocaust," he said. "We do not
6nd this a prank at alL It was a malicious
act of unwarranted hatred and bigotry and
stupidity and ignorance."

    The graffiti is the first sign of bigotry
against Jews in Concord in a long time,
Schenkerman said "There are people who
have lived in this community for 30 years
who have never seen anything like this."

   The temple was vulnerable to vandal-
ism during the construction of Its addition
recently, but suffered none, Schenkerman
said.

    The graffiti was scrawled high on (fie
sloping roof hi white paint sometime after
II p.m., according to a police report A pas-
serby saw it from the road Monday morn-
ing, Schenkerman said.

   The fire department covered the graffiti
with black paint yesterday, but the paint is
darker than the roof, so the words and sign
are still obvious, Schenkerman said.

  Mr. RAUH. YOU will recall that Judge Souter made a statement
in his speech in 1976 to the Daniel Webster College that affirma-
tive action was affirmative discrimination. Well, he has said that
he hoped he didn't say that. He hasn't denied it. He ought to be
asked about that.

  But you ought to know something about the Daniel Webster Col-
lege. Daniel Webster College is the Bob Jones University of the
North. Souter's speech to Daniel Webster College in 1976 was just
exactly what they were looking for: calling affirmative action af-
firmative discrimination. If you have any question about it, here is
the letter that was received 2 years later from minority students at
Daniel Webster College talking about the harassment of black stu-
dents there, the slurs the KKK made, and "niggers suck" are fre-
quently written on the walls of our room. Judge Souter should be
asked, is this the kind of a place that you can say does not have
any discrimination? Were you aware of the kind of place you were
going to? Then the idea that there is no discrimination there.

  This is a piece from the Atlanta Constitution, making clear the
exact degree of discrimination. This is what the Atlanta Constitu-
tion says about this matter. It says, "White Bias in America, Part
2, New Hampshire." Then over here it says, "Racism is not a
Southern or even a regional phenomenon," and New Hampshire is
their example.

  You have over here another absolutely frightening example of
the problems in New Hampshire that our friend, Judge Souter,
couldn't see. When Meldrim Thomson, the Governor of New Hamp-
shire, visited South Africa, he is the one person who came back
and said blacks in South Africa were doing very well under apart-
heid. His attorney general never spoke out against that. I can only
say for myself I could not work for a man who said in 1978 that
blacks in South Africa were doing very well under apartheid.

  We have here the story of a racial club that wouldn't serve a
black man, a black referee of a well-known reputation. And I don't
know. Maybe there is no discrimination, but the press up in New
Hampshire doesn't say that. It is only Judge Souter who has said
that, and in this particular instance, he should have been asked--
and will be asked, if you recall him, as we beg for--whether he has
ever been a member of or even gone to such a club. I don't think
the members of this committee which has voted on that subject
would want to go to a club that wouldn't admit a black man.

  There is also here the story of "Klan holds King Day area re-
cruitment effort." There are two stories on that.

  Now, he says we really don't have a problem here, we don't do
anything wrong in New Hampshire on race, but they have defeated
under acrimonious terms, time and again, having a person to deal
with this problem. Here is a story of a man he appointed to the
Human Rights Commission who had to be withdrawn when it was
found his own company was guilty of international intentional race
discrimination.

  Here is the story of the Human Rights Commission case on a
man named Rallett who was harassed by being called "nigger." Is
this the place where there is no racial discrimination?

  Finally, just on these, Senator Chandler is the district senator
from Weare, the home of Judge Souter. Shouldn't he be asked what

       39-454--91-
                                              534

his relations are with his own senator? He was the attorney gener-
al. This is his own senator. Listen to what he said as a racial joke:
"Jesse Jackson has stopped running for President because it was
found out that his grandmother had posed for the centerfold of Na-
tional Geographic."

   That is a pretty rough joke.
   I want to make perfectly clear that I am not accusing Judge
Souter of ever having done these things. I am saying he should be
questioned about them when he brought up--the leadership confer-
ence didn't bring up here that the State of New Hampshire does
not have racial problems. Nobody on our side has ever said that.
That was brought up by Judge Souter.
   I am saying if Judge Souter is so insensitive to these problems of
race, to these problems that are going to come before the Court, so
insensitive that he says they don't exist, I don't see how a man can
get a fair deal from him.
   Finally, I see my time is up, and I have appreciated what you
gave me, Senator. But I do want to make this point because it is so
important. There are ways of finding out Judge Souter's views
without asking him how he is going to vote. What you simply
didn't do that you should have--and I think if you will recall him,
you can do it--you can ask him what he ever said to people about a
particular case, using Roe v. Wade as an example, although I don't
mean it as the thing. He should be asked, Did you ever discuss Roe
v. Wade with your nice friends and lawyers in the situation there?
Why, he would have had to answer, and if he hadn't told the truth,
why, someone would have come forward. There is a way of finding
what a person said about a thing, and that is a fact, not an opinion.

   I thank you for the chance to be here. I hope you will recall the
judge. I think we are entitled to that. Everything that I have said
has come up since last night because we didn't know what you
would ask about. Please analyze the record, work with us, and
there will be plenty to ask. I have only given you 10 examples.
There are at least that many more in here of racism in New
Hampshire, which Judge Souter says doesn't exist. I hope that
these can all be put in the record, and I hope your staff will exam-
ine them to see whether we do not have a real case of new items
for a new interrogation. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Bronk.

                        STATEMENT OF JOAN BRONK

  Ms. BRONK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senators, I am Joan Bronk, national president of the National
Council of Jewish Women. I am not an attorney. I am not a consti-
tutional law scholar, and my testimony has not been prepared in
consultation with such experts. I proudly speak as an American
Jewish woman on behalf of an organization of 100,000 volunteers
serving women and their families through community service, edu-
cation, and advocacy in 500 communities nationwide.
  Each day, NCJW volunteers deal with the outcomes of court ac-
tions, as volunteer service providers for homeless families, juve-
niles involved in abuse and neglect cases, victims of domestic vio-
                                             535

lence, and youngsters in correctional facilities. These people are af-
fected by the courts and so, too, by the outcome of your delibera-
tions. They depend on the courts to make "the promises of the Con-
stitution a reality," an obligation expressly recognized in Judge
Souter's testimony before this committee.

  We have listened carefully to the nominee's comments and expla-
nations to discover the extent to which he is likely to fulfill that
obligation. In two areas of vital importance to the National Council
of Jewish Women, we were not reassured.

  Time and again throughout his testimony, Judge Souter ada-
mantly refused to discuss the issue of reproductive rights. Despite
the fact that the nominee expounded on issues related to other up-
coming or controversial cases, such as church-state relations and
criminal justice, he would not elucidate even his methodology for
approaching reproductive rights. He merely promised to listen to
both sides--a restatement of what we know to be the obligation of
all jurists.

  Based on the testimony we have heard, it would require a leap of
faith to assume that Judge Souter recognizes and would protect the
fundamental right to privacy beyond the right of married people to
bear children. And as for the fundamental right of privacy for un-
married people, the judge remains silent.

  Reproductive rights, including abortion, is not just a woman's
issue. It is a family issue. If women are not free to control their
reproductive lives without Government intervention, what kind of
future can their families expect? If the Court continues to limit or
eliminates the ability of women to make this basic personal and
private decision, how can women ever hope to realize equality and
freedom? In fact, NCJW believes that reproductive freedom is a re-
ligious liberty issue. When Government eliminates that freedom, it
preempts individuals from basing their decisions on religious be-
liefs and practices.

  In addition to our concern about Judge Souter's silence on repro-
ductive rights, we are wary of his views on gender discrimination.
Although Judge Souter recognizes that such cases should not be
left to the minimum scrutiny, his vagueness on how to handle
gender discrimination is disturbing. So, too, was his statement to
you, Mr. Chairman, expressing concerns about the present middle
tier because he has yet to support this as a minimum starting
point.

  In recent years, NCJW's community service and educational
projects have focused on women in the workplace. From our experi-
ence, we are aware of the importance of protections against gender
discrimination in employment and on the worksite. We are con-
cerned that antidiscrimination protection for all workers has been
severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions. We cannot risk
continued setbacks in this critical area.

  The committee's deliberation on this nomination covered many
areas beyond those we have addressed in our testimony. NCJW
also has a wider range of concerns and activities. However, the Na-
tional Council of Jewish Women believes that the right to privacy
and equality for women are promises of the Constitution that must
be kept.
                                      536
  Judge Souter's intellect and apparent warmth are to be admired,
but Judge Souter's failure to respond directly and adequately to
questions concerning privacy and equality for women lead us re-
spectfully to ask you to oppose this nomination.
  Thank you for inviting us to participate in the process.

                                     Testimony of Joan Bronk
                   President, National Council of Jewish Women
                 Senate Judiciary Committee, September IS, 1990

I am Joan Bronk, National President of the National Council of
Jewish Women. I am not an attorney. I am not a constitutional law
scholar, and my testimony has not been prepared in consultation
with such experts. I speak as an American Jewish woman on behalf
of an organization of 100,000 volunteers serving women and their
families through community service, education and advocacy in 500
communities nationwide.

Each day, NCJW volunteers deal with the outcome of court actions,
as volunteer service providers for juveniles involved in abuse and
neglect cases, homeless families, victims of domestic violence, and
youngsters in correctional facilities, among others. These people
are affected by the courts and so, too, the outcome of your
deliberations. They depend on the courts to make "the promises of
the constitution a reality," an obligation expressly recognized in
Judge Souter's testimony before this Committee.

We have listened carefully to the nominee's comments and
explanations to discover the extent to which he is likely to
fulfill that obligation. In two areas of vital importance to the
National Council of Jewish Women, we were not reassured.

                                                       -2-
Time and again throughout his testimony, Judge Souter adamantly
refused to discuss the issue of reproductive rights. Despite the
fact that the nominee expounded on issues related to other upcoming
or controversial cases, such as church-state relations and criminal
justice, he would not elucidate even his methodology for
approaching reproductive rights. He merely promised to listen to
both sides--a restatement of what we know to be the obligation of
all jurists.

Women cannot afford to take the leap of faith required to assume
that Judge Souter would recognize and protect the fundamental right
to privacy. Does the nominee only recognize that fundamental right
as it pertains to procreation within a marriage? Based on the
testimony we have heard, we have no indication to the contrary, and
we are deeply concerned.

Reproductive rights, including abortion, is not just a woman's
issue--it is a family issue. If'women are not free to control their
reproductive lives without government intervention, what kind of
future can their families expect? If the Court continues to limit
or eliminates the ability of women to make this basic personal
decision, how can women ever hope to realize equality and freedom?
In fact, NCJW believes that abortion rights is a religious liberty
issue. When government eliminates freedom of choice in abortion,
it pre-empts individuals from basing their decisions on religious
beliefs and practices.

                                                       -3-
In addition to our concern about Judge Souter's silence on
reproductive rights, we are wary of his views on gender
discrimination. Although Judge Souter recognizes that such cases
should not be left to the minimum scrutiny, his vagueness on how
to handle gender discrimination is disturbing. So, too, was his
statement expressing concerns about the present middle tier test
because he has yet supported this as the minimum starting point.

In recent years, NCJW's community service and educational projects
have focused on women in the workplace. From our experience, we are
aware of the importance of protections against gender
discrimination in employment and on the worksite. We are concerned
that anti-discrimination protection for all workers has been
severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions. We cannot risk
continued setbacks in this critical area.

The Committee's deliberation on this nomination covered many areas
beyond those we have addressed in our testimony. NCJW also has a
wider range of concerns and activities. However, the National
Council of Jewish Women believes that the right to privacy and
equality for women are promises of the constitution that must be
kept. Because of Judge Souter's failure to respond directly and
adequately to questions concerning privacy and equality for women,
we respectfully ask you to oppose his nomination.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Ms. Bronk, for a well-reasoned and
succinctly stated statement, and within the time. Let me begin
with you.

  With regard to the issue of the equal protection clause of the
14th amendment, let me be the devil's advocate for a moment. It is
true, isn't it, that the last part of his discussion on this issue and
the least part of his criticism, when he talked about the middle
tier, when he was refusing to say precisely what tier he would
apply, attempting to avoid discussion of the precise principles he
would apply, he said that his concern was, and his concern with
the middle tier as presently constructed, was that it too easily "col-
lapsed into the very lowest tier of review."

  Now, so while you are correct in saying that he did not establish
that he was for a test more exacting than the current test, some of
his comments suggest that he might be inclined in that direction.
Do you find his concern about collapsing into the lowest tier some
evidence of the fact that he at least thinks that the middle tier is
an appropriate test?

  Ms. BRONK. Yes; as a matter of fact, for a few moments there, I
was encouraged when I was listening to him speak. However, since
he has obviously thought about the question in depth and written
about it, I was very disappointed and we were disappointed to
know that he could not clarify his position better, that he hadn't
thought it through so that he did have one, when the minimum
tier has been accepted for such a long period.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Hernandez, as you probably know, the news-
paper articles referred to Judge Souter's speech, as you did, the
speech that was made in the mid-seventies. In that speech, the arti-
cle reported that he called affirmative action affirmative discrimi-
nation.

  Now, during the hearing, Judge Souter testified that he did not
believe that he had made that statement. I don't know whether he
did or not, but I am sure that all of us have wondered sometimes
whether we have been properly quoted, I suspect yourself included.

  He also argued that in the face of discrimination the appropriate
response was to undo the wrong, undo the wrong rather than just
call for the discrimination to stop. That is a distinction.

  Now, what are your views with regard to Judge Souter's testimo-
ny that, first, he doesn't think he made such a statement; and,
second, that he was in his statement willing to go beyond merely
stopping the discrimination, ending the discriminatory practice,
and saying he wished to, felt we must undo the wrong? Do you find
any significance in either of those two statements?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, as to the first statement as to, you
know--

  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize. You must pull that very close. None
of us can hear you.

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. AS to the first question as to whether he, in
fact, made that statement or not, he questioned whether he was
quoted properly, but he never denied the statement or disavowed
the statement. And so, you know, in reading

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are making a distinction. He said, "I didn't
say it," so you are saying that that means that because he didn't
say "I never said it in my whole life, or I never thought it," there-
                                      541

fore he must have thought it or he must have said it some time? Is
that what you are saying?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. NO. If you look at what he said, he said, you
know, that he could possibly have been misquoted, or he doesn't re-
member saying it. He never said, "I didn't say it," or, more impor-
tantly, "That statement, if I did say it, did not represent what I
believed then," or, more appropriately, "does not represent where I
stand today." That is one.

  Now, on the second question--which I forgot. What was it?
  The CHAIRMAN. That is understandable. The second question, I
almost forgot, was that he indicated that with regard to the stand-
ard that should be applied when discrimination is found, he was
asked by me and others what action the Government should take--
because, as you know, the debate is just stop it and don't let it go
forward, or go back and attempt to undo the wrong that was done.
And he said that the appropriate response was to go back and undo
the wrong, that Government must go back and undo the wrong.
  Obviously, you find no solace in that assertion.
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Let me tell you why I find no solace. In review-
ing our position as to Judge Souter, not only did we look into the
few instances in which he had dealt with civil rights, and in those
instances had been antagonistic, but we also reviewed the 200-some
cases that had come before him. And our concern is his view of the
courts, of the legal profession, and they are very limited. Whenever
possible, and in the cases that he has taken, he has not seen the
courts as an avenue for redress. Moreover, which is something that
is of great concern to us, we want to know on what past record
must we place our belief that he understands and that he is com-
mitted to these issues.
  It is surprising that in his entire opening statement he never
raised or addressed the issue of civil rights, and it was the prodding
of you, Senator Kennedy, Senator Simon in which he was given op-
portunity after opportunity to say something about these issues,
that he addressed questions that you posed. He had no problem ad-
dressing, you know, his values, his positions on, let's say, criminal
justice, the death penalty and other issues. Those are values. And
the questions that we asked ourselves is: What are his values as to
these issues? Upon what is he going to draw? On what experi-
ences--when he says that there is no discrimination in New Hamp-
shire--is he going to draw when he decides issues of concern to us?
  You know, the English-only issue has been very divisive in New
Hampshire if you go beyond affirmative action. For the Hispanic
community today and in the 1990's, the issue of access to the
voting booth is critical to us. And for him to make those state-
ments--so, yes, I was heartened that he made some statements
after some prodding, but I would like to see much more than that.
And why is this critical? This is not just another Associate Justice
to the Supreme Court. That is what is at stake here today.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. My time is up.
  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  There was a reference made to Daniel Webster College. I have
been informed that Daniel Webster College was founded by Senator
Rudman about 1965, that he was chairman of the board until 1980,
                                      542

that it is an aeronautical training and business college. I just
wanted to put that on the record.

  I have no questions of these witnesses.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. I want to join the chairman in wel-
coming the panelists to the committee and express our apprecia-
tion for the time that you have spent in the consideration of your
recommendation.
  I would just ask of Mr. Rauh, were you able to complete your
thought on the kinds of incidents which had taken place in New
Hampshire? Were there additional points that you wanted to make
in just completing the testimony?
  Mr. RAUH. Thank you, sir. I did say a sentence or two in a hurry
about each of the 10 examples. We have then another 10 or a dozen
that we are putting in the record. I don't know if you were here
the whole time, but I wanted to make sure that I had made myself
clear.
  We are not charging anything on the judge. We are charging he
didn't do anything. We are charging he hasn't done anything. He
claims that there is no discrimination. How can a man who says
there is no discrimination find discrimination? How can he be so
insensitive to our problems? We are not making an attack on him.
  I would like, if I might, to address myself to Senator Thurmond. I
have a letter here from 22 students there which includes this state-
ment:

  These harassments range from students dressing as members of the Ku Klux
Klan, walking around the college yelling "We don't want your kind around here,"
to the breaking, entering, and destruction of our rooms and personal property. The
slurs "KKK" and "niggers suck" are frequently written on the walls of our rooms.

  Now, to forget that, to try to put that under the table or sweep it
under the rug because Senator Rudman may have had a connec-
tion with this about which I didn't know, but the fact of the matter
is, Senator Thurmond, that this letter shows what kind of a place
it is, and that these students that were harassed, there was no
outcry from the attorney general. They made a plea for help. No
help whatever. This is an insensitive man that you are foisting on
us.

  Senator KENNEDY. I think all of us, including my own State,
have gone through and continue to go through a good deal of an-
guish, in terms of trying to deal with the problems of racism, and
that continues even today and has existed for a long period of time.
I think we understand that that certainly is not limited to the
problems in any particular part of the country. It is more wide-
spread than is generally understood.

  There is the Human Rights Commission in new Hampshire and
they deal with a number of allegations, charges, and complaints.
And as I understand the procedure, when there is some finding and
when the Human Rights Commission then is challenged by a de-
fendant, then the attorney general represents the Human Rights
Commission, so there is this association with the Human Rights
Commission. I believe that to be the situation.

  I was wondering, in your review of the record, whether the prob-
lems dealing with race had been raised with the Human Rights
Commission and what the record--do you know from your own
                                               543

  Mr. RAUH. Some of the cases I gave you, at least one or two of
them, the attorney general's office was the lawyer for them and,
therefore, he would have been aware of the discrimination charges
there, and, therefore, you do not get the situation where he did not
know about the charges.

  We have not been able, as I understand it--I have not been up
there, but others of the Leadership Conference have--we under-
stand that we may not see the record of the Human Rights Com-
mission, the various records. I am not being critical of that. That is
to protect some of the witnesses, I am sure. But what has happened
is that we only know there were a certain number of complaints
and we know some of the things that got in the newspapers. We
have not been allowed to look at the actual transcripts.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me go back to a line of questioning that I
had in the opening day of the hearings, and that had to do with
representing the State's position on the question of collecting data
and information relevant to the EEOC, and also representing the
Governor on challenging the literacy tests, both situations which
were eventually overturned by the Supreme Court, in one instance
9 toO.

  The judge indicated that he was just effectively living up to the
kind of ministerial function of attorney general in pursuing the
State's interest. I tried to point out during the questioning that the
attorney general of New Hampshire takes an oath to uphold the
Constitution, as well as the New Hampshire Constitution, and I
read in the record the particular New Hampshire statute that indi-
cated that part of his functions relate not just to the attorney gen-
eral, but to the public at-large, and we had an exchange on that
issue.

  My question is this: If the position that was taken by the Judge
in those particular cases had prevailed, what would have been the
impact, in terms of Congress' power to enforce the 14th amend-
ment with regards to race discrimination?

  Mr. RAUH. Well, there could not have been any affirmative
action, without it. When he denies the words "affirmative discrimi-
nation," he is going contrary to the whole thing, he against affirm-
ative action. How can you have affirmative action, if you do not
know the results, if you do not know whether people are getting
hired, if you do not know whether there are any blacks on the
roster.

  The whole thing is a pattern, Senator Kennedy. What you have
is a speech at a racist school which I read to you, and then after
the speech, in the same year, he is saying that you cannot get a
racial breakdown. There is no way that you could possibly have af-
firmative action.

  There has been a rewriting of history. What he has done is to say
I am for affirmative action, in a sense. He has made that state-
ment, but everything in his career has opposed it. If there was any
conversion, confirmation conversion, Senator, when Judge Bork
was up here, this is a constitutional rewriting. It has just changed
the whole thing, from what the facts were during the time he was
there and what they have been since Thursday morning, this state-
ment of his.
                                      544

  Remember--and I think it was in answer to you, sir--that he
said one of my reasons for taking that position was there is no dis-
crimination in New Hampshire. He made that statement in con-
nection with the answer to you, in addition to the statement that I
read the committee in my testimony.

  Senator KENNEDY. YOU provided the information with regard to
gender, but not with regards to race.

  In talking about the sensitivity, did you form any impression
about his comments during his pursuit of the challenge to the
United States on the suspension of the literacy tests? Remember,
New Hampshire had a literacy test that was used to suspend it. I
know you have been involved in the long history of the battles over
the 1965 act and the 1970 act, I know from personal experience.

  I stated at that time that the reason that we were abolishing the
literacy test nationally was really to indicate, when that issue was
raised by many sections in the southern part of the country, that
we were going to lift them with regard to the South, why do we not
do it nationwide, and the Congress responded to that, and he chal-
lenged Congress' power under section 5 of the 14th amendment to
do so.

  Then he made some comments about the illiterates and how that
watered down the rights of others. Did that statement trouble you,
with regards to this issue of sensitivity to individuals? I think, by
and large, those are going to be the poor individuals, working men
and women, in many instances I suppose minorities, people who
are often left out, left behind. I would ask you both, or any mem-
bers of the panel--maybe you would make a comment and then
Ms. Hernandez make a comment.

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, that is most troubling, in watching Judge
Souter testify, that there is no question about his intelligence,
there is no question that, in many ways, he is a legal scholar. The
problem is in his value system and what he uses as a resource to
make his decisions, the human compassion, the understanding, the
experience to really understand how the law is applying to human
beings, particularly those that in the past have been deprived of
their constitutional civil rights. He reverts back to very analytical
frame of mind.

  Well, the law is meant to protect people, it is for the benefit of
people. It is not for the benefit of intellectual theorizing of how one
point of view might go or the other. And if you listen to his testi-
mony for the last three days, when pushed on these issues--and I
believe if you looked at my testimony, I go specifically to those
questions--is that you really push on those issues, he reverts back
to that, because of the fact of the lack of--well, there is a lack of
experience there from which to choose from.

  You have judges who are going to be put on the Supreme Court
for life, who are going to judge on cases that deal with human
beings, and if you do not know, if you do not understand, if you do
not have a feel for their problems and what they are encountering,
then it is very easy to fall back.

  The other point, as far as the issue of Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, is that, you know, he questioned Congress' ability to
legislate in that area. And what is most troubling to us is the Jus-
                                      545

tice that he most admires, Harlan II, is the one that dissented in
Katzenbach v. Morgan.

  So once again, there is a paucity of any affirmative statements or
activities that show a sensitivity, and the only thing that we have
to go on is on his statements here before you,and I will tell you
that I was here before you on the Kennedy nomination and we
were asked to rely on the same thing.

  And we are asking once again, on a very critical nomination to
the Court, to once again take a leap of faith based on some state-
ments for the first time made before here in this hearing that he
will be open-minded and neutral. We are not asking his views spe-
cifically on how he would deal. We are asking him to be open-
minded, neutral and to have a reservoir of experience from which
he is going to use when he decides the cases that impact our lives.

  Mr. RAUH. I agree with that completely, and I think the word
"open-minded" is good, because, in fact, what you have, you cannot
be open-minded if you are unwilling to look, and he is unwilling to
look.

  Senator, you will recall that in one of the answers to your ques-
tions was, Judge Souter saying, "I was persuaded that this was a
reasonable argument, because there was no discrimination in the
literacy tests." What he meant by that, there was no discrimina-
tion against black voters, well, we do not know the answer to that,
because we were not there and we did not do it, but there was dis-
crimination. This happened to be a poor education discrimination
against the people who could not read, but he will not see. You
cannot be open-minded, unless you are willing to have an open
sight and look at the problems. He says there are no problems. He
answered that on both of your questions, he answered there are no
problems.

  Senator KENNEDY. What is the significance of those range of dif-
ferent reports and newspaper articles in relationship to the Judge's
statement that he does not believe that there are racial problems?
I mean what conclusion can you draw?

  Mr. RAUH. Well, I do not see how you can look at the ten cases I
gave--these are going into the record, the ten cases I gave--and
say that New Hampshire is not a discriminatory State. I do not say
it is the worst State, it just happens to be the worst State on
Martin Luther King's birthday, but it is not the worst State on ev-
erything, but it is a State where there is substantial discrimina-
tion, which Judge Souter has refused to see.

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Let me add another point as to that. As I indi-
cated, we are looking to those newspaper articles. He was an attor-
ney general, a deputy attorney general, and, as you know, that
office in most States or at least the States that I am familiar with,
has the responsibility to monitor and sometimes to prosecute in
cases involving issues of discrimination.

  It is difficult for me to sit here and understand and believe that,
during his tenure as deputy attorney general or attorney general,
that he never ran across such complaints or such problems. That is
the problem in this nomination.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me add, Joan Bronk, you said that NCJW
views reproductive freedom as a religious liberty issue. Can you
                                                546

give an example of how Court action to overturn Roe would im-
pinge on your religious liberty?

  Ms. BRONK. Yes, sir, the fact of the matter is that, in my own
religion, I am taught that the mother's life is paramount to the
fetus, and if, obviously, Roe were overturned, that would put
women of the Jewish faith in an untenable position.

  Senator KENNEDY. DO other religious organizations agree that
this is a religious liberty issue?

  Ms. BRONK. Yes, we work in coalition with many partners, other
Jewish organizations and Protestant organizations, as well, who
would agree with me on that, yes.

  Senator KENNEDY. OK. Is there any further comment?
  [No response.]
  Well, I want to thank you all very much. You have been very
provocative in your comments and I think all of us are going to
certainly give them a good deal of weight. I certainly will.
  I want to thank you very much, and we will recess until 3:00
p.m.
  [Whereupon, at 1:50 p.m., the committee was in recess, to recon-
vene at 3:00 p.m., the same day.]

                                           AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order, please.
  We are, as I indicated earlier, voting in the Senate, so the Con-
gressman understand, I suspect, better than anyone how the proc-
ess is working here, and my colleagues are still there, anticipating
there may be another vote. I have taken the chance of thinking
that the vote that we just took will prevail, which would preclude
another vote, so one of two things is going to happen very shortly: I
am either going to leave or a number of people are going to appear,
but I thought it important that we start.
  Our fourth panel consists of four highly respected citizens of the
State of New Hampshire: John T. Broderick, Jr., current President
of the New Hampshire Bar Association, an extremely well-respect-
ed member of the community, and I think in this context it is rele-
vant to say is active in the Democratic Party and here to testify on
behalf of the nominee.
  Steven J. McAuliffe, president-elect of the New Hampshire Bar
Association, who worked under Judge Souter as an assistant attor-
ney general and equally involved in the community; and Deborah
Cooper, former deputy attorney general of New Hampshire, who
also served with Judge Souter and very involved in the community,
as well; and Congressman Chuck Douglas, whose comment to me
earlier is he is in a sea of Democrats at the table.
  Congressman, welcome to the body. Congressman Douglas repre-
sents Judge Souter's hometown in the United States Congress, and
obviously is here to testify on behalf of the nominee.
  Now, unless you all have worked it out, I would like to reverse
the order and give the Congressman the opportunity to speak first,
because I know there are votes on the House side off and on and he
may have to leave to vote, so why don't we just work our way back.
Actually, we should go then to the current president, President
                                             547

Broderick, and then to Steve McAuliffe, and to you, Ms. Cooper,
and we will do it in that order, if we may.

  Congressman.

PANEL CONSISTING OF HON. CHUCK DOUGLAS, A REPRESENTA-
  TIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE;
  JOHN BRODERICK, PRESIDENT, NEW HAMPSHIRE BAR ASSO-
  CIATION; STEVEN J. McAULIFFE, PRESIDENT-ELECT, NEW
  HAMPSHIRE BAR ASSOCIATION; AND DEBORAH COOPER,
  FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF NEW HAMP-
  SHIRE

                     STATEMENT OF CHUCK DOUGLAS

  Mr. DOUGLAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   In addition to representing the Town of Weare, I also was a col-
league of Dave Souter's. From 1983 to 1985, we served together on
the New Hampshire Supreme Court, in a former life I had before
coming here and serving on House Judiciary. But I go back even
farther than that in knowing Dave Souter, back into the early
1960's.
   His father and my father both worked at the same bank in Con-
cord. My sister Margaret dated David on occasion during a couple
of summers when he was home from college. I had the chance to
work with him when he was a trial judge and I was on the State
Supreme Court and then, of course, in 1983 he came up and joined
the rest of us on the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
   What I wanted to do is just mention two things that I think are
special strengths that Judge Souter will bring to the U.S. Supreme
Court, and I say that as one who worked with him on a day-to-day
basis for 2 years.
   First, the way we conference cases in the Supreme Court of New
Hampshire is unique, I think, among most appellate courts, be-
cause we actually sit down around a table and talk about the cases,
line by line, and when you do that, that process that they still go
through--even though David and I are no longer there, the process
continues--it is very conducive to the fact that you will also be
working with these folks on the next case and the next case and
the next case. You do not personalize the interplay. You have your
intellectual argument, you fight over the law, but then you know
there is another case and you may be teamed up together for that
next opinion, and I think that brings the law to the forefront and
keeps personality disputes and feuds out of the process.
   That is the experience. I always enjoyed working with Judge
Souter and I know he will bring an open mind and an ability to
work in a very good way with his colleagues at the U.S. Supreme
Court.
  The second thing that I know from my experience of sitting on
the bench with him is his keen intellect that you all have obviously
observed, but also the fact that he is an intense questioner, and in
an appellate court that is very important. This is the apex of our
judicial branch of Government.
  You do not go any higher than the U.S. Supreme Court, and if
there is a loose end or a point that has to be clarified or some argu-
ment that is shaky, key questioning from the bench is very, very
                                          548

important, and Jude Souter is an aggressive questioner and I know
he will do so, if he is approved by the Senate, which he should be,
for service on the U.S. Supreme Court.

   I am very proud to have known him and to work with him and I
certainly can say nothing but that I know the hearing that he has
been through would not have been dramatically different, if you
had gaveled it in the morning after he was nominated. It is the
same Dave Souter and the questions and the answers would have
been handled the same way.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Congressman.
  Mr. Broderick.

                     STATEMENT OF JOHN BRODERICK

  Mr. BRODERICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee.

  My name is John Broderick and, as the chairman said, I am the
current president of the New Hampshire Bar Association. On
behalf of its members, acting through its Board of Governors, I am
genuinely privileged to appear before this distinguished committee
today to report the enthusiastic support of the New Hampshire Bar
Association for Judge Souter's nomination to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  The bar's 21-member Board of Governors recently passed, by
unanimous vote, a resolution urging this committee to act favor-
ably on Judge Souter's nomination and requesting confirmation by
the U.S. Senate.

  The board whose resolution I carry to this committee today has a
diverse membership of men and women representing all geographic
areas of the State of New Hampshire. The board also reflects the
breadth and scope of the practice of law in New Hampshire.

  Judge Souter has been a highly valued member of our bar asso-
ciation for almost 25 years. He has served with true distinction and
vigor for the last 12 years on the Superior and Supreme Courts of
New Hampshire. His service as attorney general of our State was
exceptional and admired by those who worked with him and by the
public which benefited from the professional leadership he provid-
ed.

  Earlier this year, we were pleased to support his nomination and
confirmation to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and were hon-
ored, as Judge Souter was, with the unanimous vote of the U.S.
Senate, and we are not surprised that he has been nominated by
the President of the United States for service on the Supreme
Court.

  Let me tell you a little something about my State. New Hamp-
shire is a small State, with a bar of 3,400 lawyers and judges. We
tend to know one another in New Hampshire, and because of our
size and constant interaction, we are uniquely positioned to recog-
nize quality.

  Our bar is politically diverse and reflective of the demographics
of our State. The quality of our membership is high and our practi-
cal approach to the practice of law is well respected. The people of
my State are fiercely independent and we revere our individual lib-
                                      549

erties. However, we fully understand that our strength derives
from our diversity and sensitivity to the rights of others. Judge
Souter exemplifies that tradition.

  My colleagues are sensitive to the critical importance of constitu-
tional stability and the compelling need to entrust the interpreta-
tion of individual freedoms and liberties only to those who have
demonstrated the highest standards of intellect, fairness and per-
sonal integrity. Judge Souter is such a person.

  Those of us who have witnessed Judge Souter's judicial perform-
ance first-hand can, in good conscience, report to this committee
that he possesses, as I think you have seen, a first-rate legal mind,
a flexible and curious appetite for the law, an unbiased ear for ar-
gument, an uncommon civility and, I think it is fair to say, a quiet
compassion. He also, from our observation, understands the world
in which he lives and the need for a judge to protect our system of
justice from the whims of transient public opinion.

  Judge Souter has never practiced or pursued any political or ide-
ological agenda while serving on the bench in New Hampshire, and
we would not expect any change in his commitment to the integri-
ty and predictability of the law and our system of justice, if con-
firmed by this Senate to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  In the final analysis, it is the considered and respectful opinion
of the New Hampshire Bar Association that Judge Souter is an
outstanding nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. Those of us in
New Hampshire know him, we like him, we respect him, and, more
importantly, we trust him to fairly and consistently interpret the
Constitution of the United States for the protection of the rights
and liberties of the American people.

  In closing, and on a personal note, on my behalf and on behalf of
two members of our bar, Terry Shumaker and Bill Glahn, who
have sat with me in the public gallery throughout this hearing, I
would like to compliment this committee and the nominee on an
extraordinary hearing. As a trial lawyer who has practiced law for
18 years and as a practitioner of constitutional rights, it has been a
genuine honor to be present before this hearing.

  Mr. Chairman, I would like to leave with this committee the res-
olution passed unanimously by my Board of Governors on August
16, 1990, and have it made a part of the official record of this pro-
ceeding. ^

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be entered in the record.
  Mr. BRODERICK. Thank you very much.

                  STATEMENT OF STEVEN J. McAULIFFE

   Mr. MCAULIFFE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and members of the Judici-
ary Committee, my name is Steven McAuliffe. I practice law in
Concord, NH. I also serve as president-elect of the new Hampshire
Bar Association and vice chairman of the university system of New
Hampshire's board of trustees.
   Mr. Broderick has just spoken for our bar association, and I cer-
tainly endorse his comments, but, with your indulgence, I would
like to take a few moments to speak for myself about Judge Souter,
in perhaps a slightly different way, based upon my own observa-
tions and experiences.
   After completing military service here in Washington, my family
and I moved to New Hampshire, where I had been hired by then
Attorney General Souter to work in his office. Like every other as-
sistant attorney general who enjoyed the privilege of working for
him, my initial interview with David Souter remains a vivid
memory, even after 13 years.

   In that interview, I first experienced what I suspect this commit-
tee and the American public has experienced these past few days,
the enormous depth and breadth of David Souter's intellect, his
dignity, his strength, his humility.

  The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office under David
Souter was an extraordinary place. He demanded only three
things: practice of law the highest level; as apolitical an office as
was humanly possible, both in fact and appearance; and absolute
integrity.

  Beyond that, David Souter demanded only that we each follow
our own path, and that we be ourselves. The office was diverse in
personality, background, attitudes, and approach, yet it was warm,
dedicated and effective. David Souter's character and personality
recruited and molded our diverse group into the best public law
firm anywhere.

  The graduates of that office still consider it, as do I, one of the
most rewarding and fulfilling growth experiences of our lives, be-
cause contact with David Souter made it so.

  In David Souter's attorney general's office, we sought the right
answer, not the expedient answer and never the political answer.
When it was our unhappy duty to represent unpopular positions or
positions with which we personally disagreed, David Souter taught
us about professionalism, and the higher, more noble duties re-
quired of advocates in the American adversarial system of justice.
He also taught us that an informed conscience is the individual's
ultimate guide.

  To know and to have worked for David Souter is to know both
honor and frustration. Frustration, because the standards of char-
acter and integrity he sets finds the rest of us so often wanting in
its pursuit.

  Let me tell you what I think David Souter is not. He is not iso-
lated. His friends are many and diverse, from baseball fans to phi-
losophers to bishops to politicians to ordinary small town new
                                      552
Hampshire neighbors. He is not sanctimonious, he helps people. He
helps them with their problems according to their abilities. He is
not pretentious. He is easily teased and teases easily.

  He is not an elitist, either intellectually or socially. David Souter,
as you have seen, is a humble and insatiable student of life, learn-
ing from and curious about everyone. He is not humorless. He
laughs easily and easiest at himself. Neither is David Souter per-
fect, except in recognizing the imperfections that we all share.

  David Souter is the kind of person who, although a lofty judge,
unhesitatingly takes strangers to out-of-the-way gas stations for
emergency fuel. He is the kind of person who maintains close per-
sonal relationships with the children of his closest friends, who
treats Ben and Brooks Glahn and Tim and Ervin Rath as any
father treats his own children. He reaches out to thank every kind-
ness and to extend many more to others, quietly and with dignity,
who listens to others' distress and provides calm and guidance.

  The other day, as I was sitting in the public gallery, an issue was
raised in this hearing concerning David Souter's capacity for un-
derstanding and human feeling. I have some experience with per-
sonal pain, as do most of you. I know many of you share my pain,
as I share yours, and I want you to know that David Souter feels
and shares and understands the pain of others with great compas-
sion and great dignity. I can tell you that under oath. Tom Rath,
Warren Rudman, and scores of others who know David Souter can
tell you that, as well. It would be unjust for this record to contain
any doubt about that, or for the American people to wrongly think
that this man might not appreciate the human condition. He does.

  Concerned groups on opposing sides seem to predict with ease,
yet contrarily, this nominee's unknown and unknowable future
vote on current social-legal issues. No one knows how David Souter
will vote--no one. David Souter does not know. David Souter does
not know, and those of us who know David Souter know he does
not know.

  David Souter, the judge, simply does not prejudge cases. He
never has. David Souter, the judge, is scrupulous about process and
thought and consequences and human impact and precedent and
integrity. Those who believe that David Souter is somehow commit-
ted or is an idealogue or is known by the White House better than
by the Senate, are mistaken.

  I, too, care about my children and the life of ordered liberty they
necessarily entrust to the U.S. Supreme Court. I, too, care about
the social issues of our time. But I also care about the continued
power and vitality of our Constitution 30 years from now. I know
that David Souter is all that he appears to be, a great judge in the
mainstream of legal thought, in whom the Nation can safely and
securely place its trust to preserve, protect and defend the Consti-
tution of the United States.

  Mr. Chairman, the special privilege of testifying before people I
greatly admire, obviously including yourself, on behalf of a person I
greatly admire, Judge David Souter, is not a privilege that I will
soon forget.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. McAuliffe.
  Ms. Cooper.

                    STATEMENT OF DEBORAH COOPER

  Ms. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the
committee, my name is Deborah Cooper. I am a lawyer in private
practice in Lebanon, a small town in New Hampshire. In my
former life, I was a member of the New Hampshire attorney gener-
al's office.

  I met David Souter in 1976, when I was a third-year law student.
It was the day that then retiring Attorney General Warren
Rudman was having his testimonial. It was David Souter's first day
as attorney general.

  Judge Souter was interviewing me for a job in the office of the
attorney general. Earlier in the year, I had had a previous inter-
view with a member of his staff. Prior to the first interview, I had
noted that the office letterhead listed only men. Curious as to
whether there were any women attorneys in the office, I asked that
question during my first interview. The staff attorney responded
that we had one, but she died. As you can imagine, I faced my
second interview with a fair amount of trepidation and substantial
reservations about whether this was the office in which I wanted to
start my legal career.

   Within the first 5 minutes of my interview with Judge Souter,
my reservations disappeared. It was clear that Judge Souter was a
man of unquestionable intellect, integrity, and warmth, and with a
true devotion to public service. For David Souter, the office of at-
torney general was governmental, not political. He did not espouse
a political philosophy, nor did he ask mine.

  The role of an assistant attorney general was to enforce the laws
of the State of New Hampshire and to act as the State's lawyer. It
was not to establish and implement a political agenda.

   While the interview itself was a grueling experience, I left the
office with a strong conviction that Judge Souter was a man for
whom I would like to work. I was one of two women hired by Judge
Souter that year, putting an end to the all-male bastian. I do not
know whether David Souter had his own affirmative action plan. I
do not know Judge Souter's position on affirmative action. I do
know that David Souter treated the women in his office with pro-
fessional respect and that he gave me and other women equal op-
portunities.

  David Souter inspired those who worked for him and challenged
them to excel. His leadership and counsel enabled us to develop
our legal skills in a way that might not have occurred elsewhere.
But equally important, David Souter's warmth, wit, and daily in-
volvement with his staff made the office of attorney general a
great place to be. There was a sense of mutual respect, loyalty, and
camaraderie among those who have worked there that is seldom
found anywhere else.

  After Judge Souter left the attorney general's office, I had the
privilege of being named deputy attorney general, a position second
only to that of attorney general. I am confident that that opportu-
nity arose largely because of the opportunities and training that I
was given during David Souter's term as attorney general.

  At the time I was named deputy attorney general, the media
gave great coverage to the fact that I was the first woman in New
                                      554
Hampshire to hold that post. Until our society reaches a level of
total equality, such a qualification will always make headlines.
Judge Souter made me believe that my gender was not the reason
for my appointment. I know that, to him, my sex was not a factor.

  I am here today because I respect and admire David Souter.
Judge Souter commands the respect and admiration of countless
others throughout the State of New Hampshire, regardless of their
political philosophies. I have unshakable confidence that Judge
Souter, if confirmed, will approach the issues before the U.S. Su-
preme Court as he did the issues before him as attorney general,
not with a preestablished political agenda or ideology, but with su-
perior legal skills, intellect, and unparalleled integrity.

  Judge Souter is the best this country has to offer.
  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Those are four eloquent statements on behalf of
a man with whom all four of you or three of the four of you have
worked.
  Mr. Broderick, have you appeared before Judge Souter?
  Mr. BRODERICK. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I have tried cases in front of
him when he was on the trial court, and I have argued in front of
him in the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Cooper, one of the things that he was ques-
tioned on at length by a number of us were cases relating to the
Equal Protection Clause and gender discrimination. I assume New
Hampshire has no such constitutional provision relating to gender.
Were there any cases argued in
  Ms. COOPER. I believe there is a State constitutional provision
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge Souter indicated, and it seems to me very
unclear, that the test, the principle that should be applied in deter-
mining whether or not a State, a governmental entity can impact
upon what a woman can or cannot do, the level of scrutiny re-
quired to impact upon her constitutional right to equal protection
under the 14th amendment is somewhere between strict scrutiny
and a rational basis test.
  As you know, governmental agencies can almost always meet a
rational basis test and find it very difficult to pass a strict scrutiny
test. He indicated that he thought the test should be somewhere in
between, and he indicated, though, that he was not particularly
happy with the middle-tier scrutiny. He said it was--I forget his
phraseology--fuzzy, not very firm, or whatever.
  After having worked with him, do you have any thoughts as to
where he is likely to come down on those issues?
  Ms. COOPER. I cannot predict how Judge Souter would come down
on those issues, Senator. I know that he would approach them with
the fundamental sense of fairness and I believe that, based on my
personal experience and working with him, that he has great re-
spect for women and for women in the profession.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS a woman, do you have any, not doubts about
his integrity or his capability, but do you wonder where he will
come down on issues relating to sex discrimination and on repro-
ductive rights? Does it concern you at all?
  Ms. COOPER. Yes, it certainly does. I do wonder. I have concerns
and I have questions, but I have ultimate faith in David Souter's
                                      555

ability to approach those in a professional and skilled manner. He
is not

  The CHAIRMAN. Congressman--excuse me, go ahead.
  Ms. COOPER. I just wanted to add that he is not insensitive to the
issues that affect women.
  The CHAIRMAN. Congressman, you served with him on the Su-
preme Court

   Mr. DOUGLAS. Yes, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. You as a Supreme Court Justice and
he as a Supreme Court Justice. For how long a period?

  Mr. DOUGLAS. From 1983 to 1985, when I resigned to go back into
practice, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. He indicated that there was a ninth amendment,
which came as a surprise to many of us, and he seemed to imply,
although, when pressed, did not give much to back it up, that there
were unenumerated rights potentially yet to be discovered in the
Constitution.

  I had great trouble, along with the Senator from Pennsylvania, I
had great difficulty squaring his asserted judicial philosophy with
the statements that he made in attempting to explain it. He sound-
ed to me, when he spoke, just like a man who admitted that there
was as good deal of subjectivity in application of the Constitution.
Could you enlighten us at all on what you believe his judicial phi-
losophy to be?

  Mr. DOUGLAS. Well, I would not want to attempt to do that in the
sense of summarizing what you folks have heard for 3 days from
Judge Souter. I will say that, with regard to the ninth amendment,
if the text of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights itself is read,
the ninth amendment's very words say that there are rights unen-
umerated and they are reserved to the people. The writers of the
Bill of Rights were concerned, as any group of lawyers would be,
what if we forget something, what if we leave something out, we
have search warrants and we have got freedom of religion and
speech, but we might forget something, and whatever those funda-
mental and inherent rights are that the citizens have, they are pro-
tected in the ninth amendment.

  There is a recent book out about the forgotten ninth amendment
and it is very helpful reading, because it is one of those amend-
ments that rarely gets used. It was cited in Griswold. I am not sure
it has been cited much at all since then, possibly, you know, a foot-
note somewhere, but the ninth amendment is in the text, it is part
of the 10 amendments that form the Bill of Rights, and I think all
he was saying is that there is a textual recognition in the Bill of
Rights itself that you cannot just put blinders on and say unless it
is right here in these first eight amendments, the tenth being re-
served to the States, it does not exist.

  The CHAIRMAN. My time is up. Let me yield to my colleague
from South Carolina.

  Senator THURMOND. I want to thank the witnesses for coming
here today, and you are people who know the judge personally.
You worked with him and know him well and I am not going to
take more of your time. I appreciate your testimony.
                                      556

  He has impressed me as being a very fine, able man and an ex-
cellent lawyer and has a good record as a judge. I presume you
agree with that.

  Now, I have just one question I want to ask each one of you and
I will just start with you, Mr. Broderick. Incidentally, you are now
president of the New Hampshire Bar Association?

  Mr. BRODERICK. Yes, I am, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Cooper, you are former deputy attorney
general under Judge Souter?

   Ms. COOPER. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Douglas, you are now a Representative
from the State of New Hampshire?

   Mr. DOUGLAS. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. I just want the record to show that. The
question is a very simple question. Is it your opinion that Judge
Souter has the competency, the dedication, the courage, the integri-
ty, and the fairness to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States? We can start, Mr. Broderick, with you.

  Mr. BRODERICK. Yes, Senator, I think he is uniquely qualified in
that regard. I think he has all of those qualities.

  Senator THURMOND. MS. Cooper.
  Ms. COOPER. I concur wholeheartedly.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. McAuliffe.
  Mr. MCAULIFFE. Absolutely, Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Douglas.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. Same answer. Absolutely.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much. I have no more ques-
tions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. I just want to welcome all of the panelists and
thank them very much for joining us here and for your statements
and comments. I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Ms. Cooper, you commented about being the first woman to join
the attorney general's office. Were you recruited or were you a
walk-on?
  Ms. COOPER. I think I wrote a letter to the Office of Attorney
General, along with 1,000 other letters, during my third year in
law school, and I received a response and an invitation to an inter-
view in response to that.
  Senator SPECTER. Was there any active recruiting program by
Judge Souter to bring in other women or minorities into the State
attorney general's office?
  Ms. COOPER. I don't know that, Senator. I am not aware of any at
the time that I was hired, and I was not in a position to know
whether he was doing that at the time he was making the hiring
decisions.
  Senator SPECTER. Was there any Afro-American on the staff?
  Ms. COOPER. Not during the time that I was there.
  Senator SPECTER. Was the Office of the Attorney General an ac-
tivist in the sense of pursuing consumer rights cases or antitrust
cases if you had jurisdiction there, or activist in the sense of being
                                      557

concerned about issues like prison overcrowding, if your prisons
were overcrowded in that era?

  Ms. COOPER. I think that it was becoming during the time of
Judge Souter's appointment as attorney general increasingly active
in the fields of consumer protection and environmental law. I be-
lieve it was under Senator Rudman's term that those divisions of
the office were established, and they continued to grow and become
more involved in those issues in New Hampshire during Judge
Souter's term.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I know that the Office of Attorney Gener-
al of New Hampshire has responsibility of trial of murder cases, as
I understand it. Was the office active in programs such as police
education programs to try to give instruction on observing constitu-
tional rights to make valid arrests without infringing on constitu-
tional rights?

  Ms. COOPER. At some point during my term--I don't know exact-
ly when--there was established a State agency called the Police
Standards and Training Council that was charged with the respon-
sibility of training police officers. And I know that there were
members of the staff that would provide seminars and assistant
teaching during any of the continuing type of education provided to
police officers in that context.

  Senator SPECTER. Congressman Douglas, were you on the State
supreme court at the same time that Judge Souter was?

  Mr. DOUGLAS. I was from 1983 to 1985. I was appointed in 1977,
and he went on the Superior Court in 1978. So we served as judges
for about 8 years at the same time, but for 2 of those years we were
at different levels of the court system.

  Senator SPECTER. During the course of Judge Souter's testimony,
I think there was a uniform reaction among committee members as
to the powers of his intellect. We have very wide ranging discus-
sions on many subjects, and he has a thorough command of the
cases and of the rationale and of the reasoning and constitutional
history. You might be in a position to give us some insight into his
potential as a Supreme Court Justice. I would be interested to
know what your speculation would be as to his potentiality as an
intellect of some substantial dimension.

  The Court is characteristically occupied by men and women of
significant talent, but there are some legal giants in the Court
from time to time. You have had a unique opportunity to work
with him. I am not asking you to divulge any confidences of your
court conferences, but I would be interested in your speculation or
judgment on that question.

  Mr. DOUGLAS. Well, Senator, if I could, I think that one thing
that I observed, yesterday afternoon I sat in for about IV2 hours to
see the questioning and how Judge Souter handled it. It impressed
me at the time that this is the same David Souter I have known for
years. He basically could have done the same job if the hearings
had begun the morning after his nomination. You could have had
him in here sitting here at 9 o'clock just the day after, and he
would have been the same.

  Senator SPECTER. All that preparation was for naught?
                                      558

  Mr. DOUGLAS. NO. I am sure he was more prepared than he
would have been, but his style, his demeanor, his ability to under-
stand cases--I won't get into any specifics in conference, but

  Senator SPECTER. Was he a leader on the Court?
  Mr. DOUGLAS. It would depend on the issue, as with any court. In
other words, on a given case, each of the five of us might have
stronger views than on the next case. Frankly, some areas of the
law are less of interest to each particular Justice, just as all of us
in the legislative body find some bills more interesting than other
bills. But always he was on top of the material, could synthesize
the arguments. If we seemed to be drifting aside and had not quite
gotten the thing nailed down, Judge Souter would always be the
one who could say, well, what you really want us to say is such-
and-such, and if we were to change this paragraph, this would keep
the principle of the law the way you want it but wouldn't do vio-
lence to the concern of Judge X over here.
  Senator SPECTER. Excluding yourself, perhaps, was he a leader, a
cut above the other justices?
  Mr. DOUGLAS. Oh, yes, yes, in terms of intellectual capability,
reasoning skills, writing skills, he is definitely not like most of the
judges I have had contact with, and that is true around the Nation.
He is an exceptional human being with a phenomenal ability to
hear the arguments and synthesize the case and come out with
something that I know will be a great credit, not only to this body
who will hopefully confirm him, but also the Court.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU may not want to answer this question, but
I would be interested in your observation. We discussed extensively
interpretivism and original meaning and judicial activism. In read-
ing Judge Souter's cases, I had the firm impression that he was re-
strictive is his interpretation of the law, not expansive, selecting
those words as opposed to liberal or conservative which have so
much baggage which attaches to them.
  In one of his cases, Richardson, he found a liberty interest. That
was the only one that I could find. And while he recognized crimi-
nal rights in a number of cases, he was strong on law enforcement.
I thought there was good balance in the criminal law.
  In the civil side, it seemed to me that his opinion in the Estate of
Dionne was more characteristic of his approach, where he went
back to original meaning, wanted to find out the intent, the con-
tent of the drafters at the time the doctrine was entered. Judge
Bell cited that this morning as a case of vision. I disagreed with
that characterization. It seemed to me that that was restrictive,
and that is all right if that is where he was.
  His testimony was really significantly different, I thought. He
was prepared to have the Court fill a vacuum which was not acted
on by the legislature and by the executive. He found the liberty
clause expansive. It wasn't just an incorporation of the Bill of
Rights into the due process clause of the 14th amendment. The or-
dered concept of liberty of Cardozo in Palco was only a starting
point for him. That is the bane of the existence of the interpreti-
vists, as I read their writing.
  I would be very interested to know, if you would care to com-
ment, to whatever extent you would care to comment, about where
                                      559
you saw Judge Souter on the philosophical spectrum in your work
with him.

  Mr. DOUGLAS. I wouldn't want to even speculate on that because
we were in a different situation. When you serve on a State su-
preme court, you are not the free agent that you are in the sense of
making a final decision as the U.S. Supreme Court does. A State
supreme court does not have, in certainly Federal constitutional
law, any variant. You are really an intermediate court.

  When it comes, however, to our own common law, which, again,
State supreme courts make but the U.S. Supreme Court does not--
areas of law like torts, contract, family law--he is--I don't want to
label anything. He did the job that we had to do. We are makers of
law in the areas torts, contracts, whole varied areas where judge-
made law is what you administer and you decide on a case-by-case
basis the common law for New Hampshire, or in your State, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

  He knows the distinction between those two roles. So I don't
know what label that gives you, but he knows the difference be-
tween where you are making law as a judge, where you are trying
to figure out what a legislature or a Congress meant, perhaps inar-
ticulately, and where you are looking at a constitutional provision
such as one of the fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights. And
that is all I would say.

  He does not view it with one label that would sweep all of those.
He can make those distinctions, did on a day-to-day basis, and I
think his cases reflect that, that he did so very admirably.

  Senator SPECTER. One final question for you, Mr. Broderick. Sen-
ator Thurmond has a wonderful comment which he makes on nom-
ination proceedings about Federal judges being courteous. The
more power someone has, the more courteous they should be.

  You practiced before Judge Souter. In terms of courtesy and per-
haps better characterized as patience, not only for you, a former
associate of his, but was he a patient judge, a very patient judge, a
very, very patient judge? How many very's" would you give him?

  Mr. BRODERICK. Well, I would say this, Senator Specter: I have
tried jury cases in front of him, and I think you can appreciate, as
a former practicing lawyer, that things tend to get heated on occa-
sion in a trial setting. Sometimes judges are given to get involved
in that.

  Judge Souter resisted that temptation. He was painfully courte-
ous to lawyers, although expected quality performance and compe-
tence. He was a task-master in that regard but very civil, and pain-
fully courteous to litigants.

  I think if you had jurors here and litigants in front of this com-
mittee who appeared in front of Judge Souter, they would tell you
that he is a gentleman. And so I think he has a unique tempera-
ment, and I think he will exercise it consistently on the Supreme
Court of the United States. He is a very unusual man.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  First of all, two of the witnesses are old friends, Steve McAuliffe
and John Broderick, and we are very pleased to have you here.
                                      560
  If I may follow the first question of Senator Specter just a little,
structuring it a little differently, Ms. Cooper, you talked about
Judge Souter's professional and skilled manner. But there is one
other thing that we look for--at least I look for--in addition to
being a champion of basic civil liberties. That is, some compassion,
some understanding of those who are less fortunate.
  The testimony of Judge Souter, I have to say, was somewhat dif-
ferent in tone, more compassionate than the opinions I read, than
the record I read. Any reflections, if I may ask each of you, of how
Judge Souter would be as a Supreme Court Justice in this area?
  Ms. COOPER. I have not made a great study of Judge Souter's
opinions, and I cannot comment on what compassion might be re-
vealed by his record. I can state that having worked with him and
having known him since 1976, there is a deep human compassion
there. He understands the issues that are there, whether he has
personally experienced them or not. And I am sure that he will
bring that with him when he addresses any issues that would be
before the Court if he is confirmed.
  Senator SIMON. Did you see evidence of him reaching out to
those who clearly are the least fortunate in our society?
  Ms. COOPER. NO, but I am not sure that I was in a situation
where I would have witnessed something like that firsthand. I
think what I can describe and perhaps am not articulating well is
more a sense of the man from knowing him and from having had
general discussions with him over a period of years.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Broderick.
  Mr. BRODERICK. My associations, Senator, with Judge Souter
have been largely professional. Therefore, I can't cite a specific in-
stance other than by hearsay.
  I would say this, however, on that topic: What strikes me most
about the judge is his enormous sense of humility. I find that
people who are humble, who have very little to be humble about,
are rather extraordinary people. And I think Judge Souter is a
man of enormous humility, and in my personal contact with him,
he has a great sense of humor. And I find that people that have a
sense of humor have a sense of proportion.
  I have no question in my mind, having seen him for 12 years in
our State, about his instincts or about his ability to be both intel-
lectual and compassionate. And I think Mr. McAuliffe, in his state-
ment today, indicates that in his own personal experiences, knows
the judge to be a compassionate man.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. McAuliffe.
  Mr. MCAULIFFE. Senator, I think, as I said in my statement, I
would like to reiterate that the issue of compassion, of course, was
raised in this hearing while we had the pleasure of sitting in the
back and listening. And as I said, I think it would be terribly
unjust for this record to contain any doubt about David Souter's
compassion and humanity. As Deborah Cooper said, there are
many ways to approach it. I think I would approach it as follows:
  Having worked for the gentleman, I can assure you that every
person--and this was doctrine. I mean, anybody in the attorney
general's office, from the lowest staff person to the deputy attorney
general, understood very, very clearly that any person, however
low in stature, however high and mighty in the State of New
                                      561
Hampshire that came to our office for any matter, was treated
with incredible respect, uniformly.

  David Souter does not distinguish between people of low station
in life or high station in life. He is not a man easily impressed by
titles or position, and he is not a man that is adversely impressed
by a low station in life.

  There is a great story, and I will take a few minutes, since you
have tempted me, and I will tell it to you, although it is probably
going to take up somebody's time. But there is a wonderful woman
who runs a convenience store near the office where I am now a
partner. It is what I am sure everybody is familiar with. It is like a
7-Eleven where you go in and buy bread and milk and so forth.

   When Judge Souter's nomination was announced, I was in there
getting my daily candy bar, and she said, "You know, David Souter
is quite a fellow." And I said, "Oh, Mary, I didn't know you knew
David Souter." And she said, "Well, he comes in here to pick up
milk or cokes and things when he is on hiking trips." And she said,
"You know, one day he was in here, and he was in a rush and on
his way to a hiking trip. And he was clearly in a rush. And there
was a man behind him who was in, who I knew, whose car had run
out of gas. And he was telling me about it, and he was about ready
to hike off to a gas station and get some gas. And David Souter
said, without even hesitating, turned to him and said, 'Oh, don't
worry about it. Hop in my car. I'll take you.' "

  You know, is it a monumental experience? Is it dramatically im-
portant in the universe in the sense of universal concerns that are
discussed in this body? No. But I think it gives you an insight into
the kind of man David Souter is. And I don't think you will find
anybody who knows this man that has a doubt about that. I think
you will understand--I hope--the frustration that we in New
Hampshire sometimes feel when questions like that are asked, be-
cause it is the kind of question where you say, "my God, how can
anybody ask a question like that about David Souter?" Then you
hear the stumbling responses that we have.

  It is simply not an issue. And as I said in my statement, I can
tell you under oath without hesitation, David Souter is a compas-
sionate man and a man of great dignity in his compassion. And I
know Warren Rudman can tell you that from his personal experi-
ences, and I know Tom Rath can tell you that from his personal
experiences.

  Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. Congressman.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. We are a small State, and I am going to ask Mary
Hill sometime about you, Steve. [Laughter.]
  I know just who she is.
  Senator, if I could, the only thing that I can suggest as an indica-
tor is one of those things that the record probably doesn't reflect.
But when you sit on an appellate court, as I did, and you review
the appeals from the superior court, you get a very strong feeling
about who the problem judges are in terms of excessive sentencing,
people who are going far beyond a fair and strong sentence and
just, frankly, being excessive.
  I had a chance to sit on our sentence review board, which was a
group of judges on the superior court, and also on the supreme
                                      562
court. We could always see who the peaks and valleys were. And I
can tell you that we never had any sense at all that Dave Souter
was being unfair, too strict in his sentencing. He was in the normal
range, which means on a day-to-day basis, when someone had a le-
gitimate argument, he heard it and he listened. We had judges who
did not and, quite frankly, one of the reasons we had to create a
mechanism was that there were some members of the bench who
were overdoing the sentencing and in cases when it frankly wasn't
appropriate.

  So I can see it, having sat there and reviewed the sentences. You
didn't get complaints that it was excessive, unfair, outrageous,
heartless, done to play to the galleries, and that tells me a lot
about that human being. And Dave Souter I know to be someone
who is aware that those decisions have a big impact on someone's
future and their life.

  Senator SIMON. One final question, if I may address it to each of
you. It is a speculative question. If you were to guess where on the
spectrum of the Court Justice Souter ends up--presumably he will
not be where Justice Brennan is, but Justice Stevens, Justice
Powell, Justice Rehnquist, anywhere in that spectrum--what
would you guess, Mr. Broderick?

  Mr. BRODERICK. My initial instinct, Senator, as a trial lawyer is
never to guess, but I would be happy to answer your question.

  I don't know, to be honest, directly with you. My sense is--and
that is all it is--that Judge Souter, if confirmed by this Senate,
would be in the tradition of Justice Powell, perhaps.

  Senator SIMON. MS. Cooper.
  Ms. COOPER. I don't know either, and I am not sure I can charac-
terize Judge Souter in comparison to someone else who has been on
the bench, except when you asked the question, the word "moder-
ate" came to mind.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. McAuliffe.
  Mr. MCAULIFFE. Senator, you know, one thing that struck all of
us from New Hampshire watching this is how beauty is in the eye
of the beholder in terms of whether Judge Souter is a conservative,
so-called, or a moderate, so-called. And I can tell you this: Wherev-
er he falls, it will not be because he has a particular personal view-
point that he will bring to the Court. He just doesn't do that.
  I said in my statement even David Souter doesn't know what he
is going to do in a particular case, and that is true. He doesn't.
What he will do will, indeed, be a product of his analysis and sensi-
tivity and respect for law and precedent. And I, being a Democrat
and having worked for him, differ quite much, I am sure, with
other people who think of where David Souter might be on the
Court. I agree with Mr. Broderick. I think David Souter is going to
be not only a great Justice, but I think he is going to be a pivotal
centrist Justice.
  Senator SIMON. Congressman Douglas.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. I wouldn't want to try to speculate, Senator, if I
could. The one thing I do say is this: Unlike the present Court that
very often divides over footnotes and paragraphs and part 1, part 4,
part 7, what he does bring to the Court is a goal that we always
had for unanimity, if at all possible. And that requires some com-
promise, because five judges don't always see every case alike, and
                                               563

yet our court had in the high 90 percentile unanimous opinions.
You have to search long and hard in a pile of our cases to find dis-
sents and concurrences. And so I think Judge Souter will bring a
feeling of trying to give some better consistency to the law, and
where that puts him on the scale I couldn't begin to speculate.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Congressman, if Judge Souter becomes Justice
Souter and he brings unanimity to this Court
  Mr. DOUGLAS. Oh, well
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. I will be the first to move for canon-
ization. [Laughter.]
  I understand your point.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. I am not saying he is
  The CHAIRMAN. He has one heck of a job cut out for him.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. He won't pull it off, but at least his approach will
not be to look for these little fine line differences. That is, I think,
important.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand the point you are making, and I
thank you for making it.
  Senator Humphrey.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to welcome my
neighbors from New Hampshire. This, I think, you have to ac-
knowledge, colleagues, represents a pretty fine mesh, this panel,
people of diverse political points of view, probably diverse points of
view on controversial decisions, judicial decisions; and yet, to a
person, unanimous in their support of David Souter, both with re-
spect to his professional competence and his personal attributes.
  I don't know what finer mesh the committee can devise through
which to push the nominee. Maybe we should subpoena his person-
al diaries or something or have somebody inventory his house or
something. This is reaching ridiculous proportions.
  The testimony of the witnesses is eloquent and speaks for itself. I
can't embellish it further by questions, so I shall not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. I would just like to welcome you all here. I think
your testimony has been very persuasive. Representative Douglas,
having served with him on the court, we are happy to have your
viewpoint in particular. And, Mr. McAuliffe, Ms. Cooper, and Mr.
Broderick, we really appreciate you.
  Chuck, I have to say, being the authority that you are on the
Constitution over in the House, I have a lot of respect for you. I am
really happy to have you here speaking for Judge Souter. I think it
makes a lot of difference here.
  Mr. DOUGLAS. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. YOU bet.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, it is good to hear people that
know someone best. I think that is a very important thing, the
people that have their daily lives entwined with any person that
we are having before us. And it has actually been quite moving in
some of the things you say about this man, and I think this is a
very important part of it for me. I always look at little things with
people, especially politicians. I would never vote for a man who I
                                      564
didn't think listened to anything that I was saying, that he wasn't
home when I was speaking. There are people like that. Their eyes
just glaze over, and you know that you are cut out of the process.

  Then I am always interested in politicians and what vote they
get in their home precinct. I always like to mess around. I say get
me the election results, and let me look at the results in District
25-1 and see how that guy does right there among the people that
he or she lives with. Ten years, 20, 5, that is always an interesting
study for me as to how they really do in their lives and their inter-
action with others.

  Well, I had some questions, but I am not going to ask those. We
have a lot to do, and the chairman is very patient and would have
allowed that. But I think we are ready to go forward.

  Thank you very much for your testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before I dismiss the panel, in the interest of full disclosure, so it
is not printed somewhere later and given a meaning or put in a
context that it maybe shouldn't be put in, both Mr. Broderick and
Mr. McAuliffe are very, very close personal friends of mine, and
they were the cochairs of my effort to be the Democratic nominee.
So I just thought that should be stated at this point before one of
the reporters concludes that they found something out. I will just
make it easy for them. I thank them and, as you might guess, I am
somewhat prejudiced with regard to both of them. I thought their
statements were eloquent, although not totally persuasive. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Mr. BRODERICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank them both. I thank Ms. Cooper for being
here. And, Congressman, thank you for coming over. I have one
question for you before you depart and we go to vote. Would you
rather be on the bench or in the Congress?
  Mr. DOUGLAS. Congress.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. MCAULIFFE. Mr. Chairman, if I might, just because I know
you would otherwise have mentioned it, I think that the record
should also reflect that we did not testify at your request, but actu-
ally were requested by the administration to testify and sought
your permission.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct on both scores, and I thank you
all for being here. This panel is dismissed.
  Now, before we go to the next panel, let me discuss out loud with
my colleagues the way to proceed here. We have a very important
panel that is coming next made up of Ms. Smeal, Ms. Yard, Ms.
Allred, Ms. Neuborne, and Ms. Holtzman, and they all represent
important groups and are important persons in their own right.
  We have two votes. One has just been signaled. There will be two
votes that are, as we say in this business, back-to-back, which
means they will be in a row. I would suggest, depending on what
my colleagues think, rather than bring such a distinguished panel
up and then interrupt them and go and vote, why don't we go and
vote, catch the tail-end of this one and the front-end of the next
one and then get back here as quickly as we can.
  Although I now look at the photographers who have good reason
to be angry with me for not allowing them to be in that well
                                         565

during the Souter hearing, and they are already to take their pic-
tures, is that all right with you guys? [Laughter.]

  All right, if it is all right with the photographers, that is the way
we will do it. We will recess for the approximately 15 minutes it
will take us to make both votes and come back. We will recess
until then.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  We are prepared to proceed, and I thank our fifth panel for being
so gracious. As I indicated, our panel is made up of a very distin-
guished group of Americans: Ms. Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Fund for the Feminist Majority; Molly Yard, president of the Na-
tional Organization for Women; Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles attor-
ney, Ms. Allred is accompanying her client, Ms. Norma McCorvey,
who was a plaintiff in the landmark case of Roe v. Wade; Helen
Neuborne, executive director of NOW Legal Defense and Education
Fund; and Elizabeth Holtzman, former U.S. Representative from
New York and now the comptroller of the city of New York, who is
not representing the city, but is here representing herself.
  It is nice to see you, Liz.
   I welcome you all and appreciate your great concern and inter-
est, and I for one am going to have a number of questions, but let
me begin by inviting opening statements. Unless you all have
agreed to another way to proceed, I would like to suggest that we
begin with you, Ms. Smeal, if you would go first, and then we will
just work our way across the table, if that is appropriate. Is that
the way you would like to do it, or does anybody have a preference?
  Ms. YARD. Unless you want our former Congresswoman to go
first.
   The CHAIRMAN. OK. We will start with Liz and we will work our
way down the other end of the table, then.
  Again, welcome. It is good to see you back here. I wish you had
never left.

PANEL CONSISTING OF ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, COMPTROLLER,
  CITY OF NEW YORK, NY; HELEN NEUBORNE, EXECUTIVE DI-
  RECTOR, NOW LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND, NA-
  TIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN; GLORIA ALLRED, LOS
  ANGELES, CA, ACCOMPANIED BY NORMA McCORVEY; MOLLY
  YARD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN;
  AND ELEANOR CURTI SMEAL, PRESIDENT, THE FUND FOR THE
  FEMINIST MAJORITY

                 STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. Mr. Chair-
man and members of the committee, I am very grateful for the op-
portunity to testify here today, and it also gives me particular
pleasure to be here to see a number of colleagues with whom I had
the great privilege of serving together with at the time that I was
in the House of Representatives.

  The vacancy left on the U.S. Supreme Court by the resignation
of Justice William Brennan, Jr., is slight, compared to the deeper
void felt by the people of America throughout these confirmation
proceedings. There is too little in these hearings, and in the past

       39-454--91 19
                             566

record of the nominee, to reassure those concerned about civil
rights, human rights or women's rights that Judge David Souter is
suited to interpret our constitutional rights on the highest Court in
the Nation.
For women, Judge Souter has failed to pass muster in three basic
areas, three R's as fundamental as any subject in modern-day life:
rape, Roe, and the right to be free from discrimination. Because he
has failed to assure us of his fitness in these three basic subjects,
he should not be confirmed.
Nothing exposes Judge Souter's sentiments more clearly than his
attitude toward rape. In this regard, I refer to an opinion that he
authored in 1988, as a Justice on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, State v. Colbath (130 N.H. 315, 540 A.2D 1212). As a former
district attorney, and the first woman district attorney in New
York City, I have overseen the prosecution of more than 1,000 rape
cases. Judge Souter's opinion demonstrates a lack of understanding
of the human dimensions of rape.
Rape is a crime that for too long was shrouded in myths. For
many years, rape was a word barely mentioned in polite company.
After all, it was thought, nice women did not get raped. Rape was
perceived as something that happened to women who asked for it.
Women, it was thought, brought rape upon themselves by being in
a public place, wearing certain clothing, or conducting themselves
in a certain manner.

Alternatively, it was believed that women falsified claims of rape
to preserve their reputation. A woman's word was not considered
trustworthy and corroborating testimony was necessary for convic-
tion. And the woman's prior sexual activity was considered proba-
tive to showing  that  she consented  "toyest>h"e  conduct in question on
the theory that  once  a woman said                she would not be likely
to say "no."
In those instances, a rape defendant was permitted to show that
the victim was not "chaste," "upon the theory that it is more prob-
able that an unchaste woman would have consented to intercourse
than one of strict virtue"--this is Richardson & Prince, "The Law
of Evidence." Or, as Judge Cowan said in an 1835 rape case in New
York: "Will you not more readily infer assent in the practiced Mes-
salina, in loose attire, than in the reserved and virtuous Lucretia?"
Over the years, rape began to be recognized for what it was: a
crime of assault and violence. Courts and legislatures began to rec-
ognize that the attention at trial should focus on the activity of the
offender in causing the rape, not on the activity of the victim. Rape
shield laws were specifically enacted to prevent the mistreatment
of rape victims and to protect juries from the introduction of evi-
dence that fostered the myths of rape.
The premise of rape shield laws is that a woman has an absolute
right to say "no" to any man at any time. Forced sex is rape.
Whether or not a victim said "yes" to some man at some time
should be irrelevant to whether or not a man attacked and raped
her.
In 1977, as a Representative in Congress, I introduced the Feder-
al rape shield law, which became rule 412 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, still in force. Today, all 50 States have rape shield laws.
                                      567
  Yet, in the Colbath case in 1988, Judge Souter cast the rape
shield aside. His opinion is disturbing, because it resounds with the
very myths that the rape shield was designed to remove.
  Colbath was an appeal from a rape conviction under a charge of
aggravated felonious sexual assault. The defendant argued on
appeal that the trial judge improperly excluded from jury consider-
ation the activities of the rape victim in a bar several hours before
the rape. At worst, the prior activities consisted of very flirtatious
behavior. The trial judge barred consideration of the victim's con-
duct under the rape shield law, but the normally pro-prosecution
Judge Souter overturned the conviction.
  In language reminiscent of Judge Cowan and without any analy-
sis, Judge Souter found that the victim's "openly sexually provoca-
tive behavior" was crucial evidence and highly relevant to an as-
sault by the defendant hours later. Judge Souter said that a de-
fendant was entitled to show that the woman had earlier in the
day invited "sexual attention." The victim may have alleged rape,
the Judge wrote, as a way "to explain her injuries (she was beaten
around the breasts and arms) and excuse her undignified predica-
ment."
  Judge Souter draws entirely upon the myths of rape--from the
view that the victim had a motive to falsify a rape claim to the
idea that she "asked for it." In a "blame the victim" stance, he
states that the victim's flirtation was "provocative" behavior--as if
that would justify the attack upon her.
  While Judge Souter is promoted as a scholar, in the Colbath
opinion, examples of such scholarship are lacking. References are
not current and the many relevant, then-current Law Review arti-
cles and cases are ignored. For example, he dismisses as trivial the
possibility that admission of the victim's prior activity could preju-
dice the jury, despite numerous studies that prove otherwise. But
what is striking about this opinion is the willingness--even as late
as 1988, only 2 years ago--to rely upon an antiquated and demean-
ing view of women.
  The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of a
rape shield law, but it might find an unreceptive audience, if Judge
Souter were among the Justices.
  Judge Souter has also been unwilling to discuss Roe v. Wade. It
is no secret that Judge Souter could be the vote that would send
abortion to back alleys, across borders, or to endless statehouse bat-
tles. Judge Souter's refusal to respond to repeated inquiries on this
subject suggests a further remoteness from the reality of women's
lives. We cannot play hide and seek with the fundamental right of
women to privacy and to the control of their bodies.
  Unlike Judge Souter, women do not find the right to choice to be
distant. To women and girls, reproductive rights are not faraway
memories of a conversation in a dorm room 24 years ago. They are
right here, right now; they are teenage pregnancy; they are poor
women who cannot find family planning services; they are women
who have become pregnant through rape and incest. Yet, Judge
Souter will not so much as endorse the result of Griswold and ac-
knowledge the right to use birth control.
  Enforced pregnancy will never be acceptable to women. Nations
around the world--Italy, Spain, France--have changed their laws.
                                      568
Like the people of those countries, the women of America have
torn down that wall and they do not want it erected again by a
hostile Court. For many women, a life without reproductive free-
dom is a life of limited freedom.

  Appeals from decisions striking down restrictive legislation in
Pennsylvania and Guam are working their way to the Supreme
Court. Already on the docket is New York v. Sullivan, which will
review the ability of federally funded family planning agencies to
furnish information about abortion.

  In the area of civil rights, Judge Souter once again has demon-
strated a cold technocratic approach to matters of vital concern.

  Judge Souter asserted that new Hampshire could enact a voting
literacy test, and tells us that the voting of illiterates would dilute
the votes of literates. Judge Souter called that a mathematical
statement. He is wrong. It is a statement of values, a statement
that the system would do better without the votes of some of its
citizens. Some would say it is a statement that is deeply anti-demo-
cratic.

  Judge Souter tells us that the middle level of scrutiny for sex dis-
crimination cases under the 14th amendment is too vague, but he
cannot tell us what level of scrutiny he would consider appropriate
in sex discrimination matters.

  Judge Souter, in these hearings, refuses to affirm the power of
Congress to address equal opportunity and affirmative action
issues, unless, in his words, it involved "a specific remedy for a spe-
cific discrimination." This limited view does not promote broad-
ranging legislative solutions to the rectification of discrimination.

  Judge Souter has repeatedly stated that, if confirmed, he will
listen, and I believe him. But his past has shown little indication
that he can hear the voices of people. He did not hear the need in
the voices of two elderly brothers in their late seventies, when he
rejected their unemployment compensation claim, because they
could only work 4 hours a day. He wrote, "It is neither common
knowledge, nor do the plaintiffs claim, that a weak back, poor eye-
sight, or angina necessarily prevents an individual who can work
four hours a day from working eight."

  He did not hear the pain in the childhood voice of the only
Jewish student in his elementary school class who was excused
from class during the recitation of the Lord's Prayer when, years
later, he fought for the use of the Lord's Prayer in schools.

  He did not hear the voices of environmentalists when he refused
bail and demanded jail sentences for Seabrook Power protestors,
while the State was contemporaneously accepting funds for pros-
ecution of the cases from the company.

  And he does not hear the voices of women and their loved ones--
women who could be injured, mutilated, killed or sterilized from il-
legal abortions--when he describes the possible consequences from
overruling Roe v. Wade, merely in terms of political struggles, leg-
islative battles and a tug of war over federalism.

  Given this, we have no assurance that when he listens, he will
hear the human voices--the pain, the trouble, the need. And how
can we entrust him with a position on the most powerful tribunal
in the Nation otherwise?
                                         569

  Watching these hearings, reviewing Judge Souter's record, has
been a disquieting experience. People in general, women in particu-
lar, feel they have been left in a void.

  A vote to affirm Judge Souter could be a vote against important
rights, a vote against rape victims, a vote against a woman's right
to control her body, a vote against birth control, a vote against the
right to equal opportunity.

  Instead of tearing down the walls of discrimination, Judge
Souter's confirmation could mean the erection of new barriers, a
step backwards into dark ages we will no longer accept. I urge the
rejection of Mr. Souter as a Justice to the United States Supreme
Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Before I move to you, Ms. Neuborne--by the way, I would like to
thank you for all the help you have personally given me and the
committee on the Violence Against Women's Act that you played a
major part in helping us draft.
  I say that and now I am going to say something else, that I
would really appreciate it, if it is possible, to try to keep the state-
ments to 5 minutes. We have roughly 20 or 25 more witnesses and
a lot of questions, and so to the extent that you can all keep it at 5
minutes, we would appreciate it. I understand that may not be able
to be done, and I am not going to go banging the gavel down, but it
will give us a chance to ask some more questions, as well.
  With that, Helen, why don't you proceed.

                    STATEMENT OF HELEN NEUBORNE

  Ms. NEUBORNE. Thank you, Senator. We look forward to continu-
ing working with you on this legislation which, we agree, is very
important.

  I will keep my statement to 5 minutes and would ask that a
longer women's rights analysis that we have prepared on Judge
Souter be placed in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Your entire statement will be placed in the
record.

  Ms. NEUBORNE. Thank you.
  I am the executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Edu-
cation Fund, which is a women's rights organization founded 20
years ago. During those 20 years, the status of women in American
society has advanced dramatically, not to the point where a woman
sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but certainly to the point
where concerns of women, half of the electorate, must be taken se-
riously by the Senate.

  NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund is not a single-issue or-
ganization, any more than women are single-issue citizens. It is
Judge Souter in these hearings who has arbitrarily singled out one
issue, an issue of bedrock importance to all women, the scope of the
right to privacy. He has refused to answer questions about this one
issue, in the same forthcoming way that he has addressed all other
questions. This selective refusal and Judge Souter's own imposition
of a "litmus test" to determine what he will or will not tell the
public about his opinions on prevailing law requires us to oppose
him.
                                      570
  We call upon members of this committee and the Senate to vote
against this nomination. When privacy hangs in the balance, as it
does today, and women live under the threat that our fundamental
constitutional right to decide for ourselves when and whether to
have children may be taken away, Supreme Court nominees must
be assessed according to their candor on that subject. Judge Souter
has made up his own rules on what he will answer, which are dif-
ferent for privacy than for all other issues. This is not a game and
we cannot condone such a selective approach.
  We know that you cannot force Judge Souter to answer, but just
as you would in a civil proceeding, it is fair in this proceeding to
draw a negative inference from his selective silence, especially
when so much is at stake. He has failed to meet the burden that so
many of you so eloquently described. Therefore, the responsibility
is now yours to reinforce the integrity of the confirmation process
and the important role that you play under the advice and consent
clause of the Constitution.
  If you do not know--and none of us know--where Judge Souter
stands on the settled law that was announced in Roe v. Wade and
applied in every abortion-related case since, you must oppose him.
You have no right to gamble with our bodies and our lives.
  What has Judge Souter said and what has he refused to say? His
insistence on referring to marital privacy instead of the generally
accepted individual privacy rights that now exist, and his state-
ment that not all privacy rights, even marital privacy rights are
fundamental, in themselves mark a retreat from the principles ar-
ticulated by the Supreme Court, even before Roe. It is, therefore,
meaningless to say, as he did, that he has no agenda on what
should be done with Roe v. Wade, when it is clear that his view of
the law diverges from the established practice of the past genera-
tion. The Court will overrule its settled privacy precedents, only if
Judge Souter wants it to and becomes the fifth vote to make that
change.
  The current Supreme Court is divided on, and constantly re-
evaluating, many issues other than privacy, issues like affirmative
action, church-state, equal protection doctrine, aspects of criminal
procedure, modes of statutory construction, as well as the role of
the 10th amendment. However, the real prospect of Supreme Court
reevaluation has not precluded Judge Souter from discussing his
views on these subjects, sometimes very forthrightly and fully with
this committee.
  For example, Judge Souter was prepared to tell this committee
where he stands on affirmative action ordered by Congress to
remedy past discrimination, always a controversial subject. He was
also prepared to discuss fully his views on the continuing develop-
ment of legal doctrine based on the religion clauses of the first
amendment. He criticized existing law, but expressed reluctance to
overrule precedent, without knowing what comes next.
  Similarly, he discussed equal protection doctrine critically, but
cautiously.
  By contrast, his adamant refusal to be candid in the area of pri-
vacy and abortion can do nothing but create the very reasonable
and strong inference that he is prepared to jettison established law
in this most important area for women. It was, therefore, simply
                                      571
wrong for Judge Souter to have told Senator Biden that the reason
he was so expansive on some issues, yet so reticent on privacy, is
because "there is no serious possibility" that the Court will change
its basic approach on any issue but privacy and abortion. Judge
Souter provides that serious possibility; where the Court is closely
divided, he will dictate its future direction.

  Judge Souter has created the single-issue problem. The only area
he declined to discuss openly was privacy and abortion. It is your
responsibility to look beyond what he has said to what he has re-
fused to say. Judge Souter's selective silence on the issue of privacy
speaks louder than words.

  Thank you.

                                            SEPTEMBER 4, 1990

         Since David Souter was selected by President Bush as his
Supreme Court nominee to replace retiring Justice William
Brennan, the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund has researched
Souter's judicial opinions, spoken with attorneys who appeared
before M m while he was a judge on the superior court (1978-1983)
and the state supreme court (1983-1990) in New Hampshire, and
reviewed his opinions and briefs as New Hampshire Attorney
General (1976-1978). Contrary to popular media pronouncements,
Souter is not a blank slate. Although there is not a long paper
trail, all of the information about him indicates that we have
ample reason to fear what his appointment would mean to the
future of reproductive and other women's rights, civil rights
and individual rights.

         NOW LDEF has serious concerns about this nomination and will
oppose it unless these concerns are addressed satisfactorily by
Souter upon questioning at the Senate Judiciary Hearings. If
Souter does not recognize that the Constitution guarantees the
fundamental right to privacy and gives women the right to equal
protection of the law, he does not belong on the U.S. Supreme
Court.
                                     573

.TUDTCTAL PHILOSOPHY ON THE CONSTITUTION

         The Bork confirmation hearings were noteworthy for the
Senate Judiciary Committee's thoughtful and thorough questioning
of Judge Bork as to his judicial philosophy. Bork's adherence to
extremist theories of constitutional and legislative interpreta-
tion doomed his nomination. Evidence suggests that Souter's
theories are similarly troubling.

          Souter's record on the New Hampshire Supreme Court reveals
 that he is a judge who apparently believes that perplexing
 constitutional law issues of our time should be decided solely by
 reference to the intent of the framers of the Constitution. This
 posture has dramatic negative implications for equal protection
 and privacy rights, which are rights of citizens not written into
 or interpreted as part of the Constitution until long after the
 document was originally framed. Throughout the nineteenth
 century and the first seventy years of this century, equal
 protection challenges were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court to
 such obviously discriminatory sex-based classifications as laws
 denying women the right to enter into contracts or practice as
 lawyers. Only in the 1970's did the Court develop a new test for
 evaluating such challenges, the application of "intermediate
 scrutiny," which resulted in many sex-discriminatory laws being
 struck down.
                                  574

         Souter has questioned the development of this level of
scrutiny, which requires the Court to find that a sex-based
classification in a law is substantially related to an important
government interest or to strike it down. This level of scrutiny
is not as rigorous as that applied to race-based classifications
or those based on national origin, alien status or being born out
of wedlock. It is, however, more likely to result in a statute
being struck down than "rational relationship" scrutiny, which is
applied to all other types of legal classifications and which
requires a challenger to show that the classification has no
rational relationship to the legitimate government interest
allegedly served by the statute.

          In one case in 1978, Helqemoe v. Meloon. while Souter was
Attorney General of New Hampshire, the Attorney General's office
filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme
Court requesting that the Court review a decision by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The brief was submitted
under the names of Souter and an assistant Attorney General, but
given the importance of petitions for writs of certiorari to the
 nation's highest court, it is likely that Souter approved all the
 contents. The appellate court had struck down the New Hampshire
 "statutory rape" law which criminalized sexual intercourse
 regardless of consent between a man and a female less than
 fifteen years old. The court had done so after applying
 intermediate scrutiny to the law, which it found to contain a
                                   575

sex-based classification because only females could be victims
and only males could violate the law. The Attorney General's
brief to the Supreme Court argued that the intermediate scrutiny
test, which had been fully articulated by the Supreme Court two
years before for the first time in Craig v. Boren. 429 U.S. 190
(1976), "lacks definition, shape or precise limits," that it
would "permit subjective judicial preferences and prejudices
concerning particular legislation," and that "the instant case
represents an opportunity for the Court to define, shape, limit,
or even eliminate the new standard." Helgemoe v. Meloon,
petition for writ of certiorari at 18-19.

          This is strongly negative language about a test which ended
 nearly two centuries of state sanctioned sex discrimination.
 While the intent of the petition for review may have been to
 argue for upholding laws protecting young women from being
 coerced or manipulated into sex by older men, this legal approach
 would have sacrificed the larger goal of protection for women
 from sex discriminatory laws. The Supreme Court chose not to
 review the case, but ironically, in 1981, in Michael M. v. Super.
 Ct. of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464 (1981), when the Court did
 review the equal protection issues raised by sex-specific
 statutory rape laws, intermediate scrutiny was applied and the
 identical Californian statute was upheld.

           Souter's reliance on an extremist original intent method of
                                  576

analysis can also be seen, for example, in In Re Estate of
Dionne. 518 A. 2d 178 (N.H. 1986). Souter was the lone dissenter
in this case arising from a will contest. Under a New Hampshire
legislative scheme, the parties are required to pay a fee to the
judge if the will is probated at a contested hearing on a day the
probate judge is not scheduled to sit. In this case, both
parties argued that the lower court ruling was null, void and
unconstitutional under the state constitution because they were
required to pay for the probate judge. The relevant section of
the state constitution, part I, article 14, provides the "right
to obtain right and justice freely, without being obligated to
purchase it." The majority of the state supreme court held that
the imposition of such fees was unconstitutional. Souter makes
several interesting statements in his dissent. He first
concludes that although he disagrees with the fee system, the
 system is not "subject to the regulation of the judicial branch
 in accordance with its own notions of good public policy,"
 Dionne. 518 A.2d at 183, and is subject to review only under the
 state constitution. Souter then rejects the constitutional
 argument based on his analysis of the legislative history and the
 intent of the New Hampshire Constitution's framers. He writes,
 as to the framers' intent, that.

           "the language of the Constitution is to be understood
           in the sense in which it was used at the time of its
           adoption." ...We confirmed the vitality of this
           interpretive principle as recently as five years
           ago...and it is just as applicable today in the
           construction of article 14 as it was in that recent
                                 577

         case, construing the article 15 right to jury trial.
         The court's interpretive task is therefore to determine
         the meaning of the article 14 language as it was
         understood when the framers proposed it and the people
         ratified it as part of the original constitutional text
         that took effect in June of 1784.

Dionne. 518 A.2d at 181 (citations omitted). Under Souter's
analysis, the payment of a special fee to judges for contested
hearings does not violate the state constitution because the fee
scheme was reenacted at about the same time as the relevant
constitutional provision was being considered and ratified,
leading Souter to believe that the constitutional framers did not
find the fee system unconstitutional. Although the parties in
the case did not allege inability to pay, it is noteworthy that
Souter's constitutional analysis contains no discussion of
whether the fee system might be inappropriate in modern times, or
of whether such a fee requirement might deny access to probate
court to the poor, a group not protected and perhaps not even
considered when the statute and the constitution were being
written.

          This "original intent" approach is entirely inappropriate
 for Supreme Court Justices. The most important cases facing a
Supreme Court Justice are those of first impression requiring
constitutional interpretation. Some decisions are dictated by
 stare decisis, the doctrine requiring decision-making consistent
 with past Supreme Court precedent, but many require the Justices
 to decide what is constitutional with only the language of the

                                                              6
                                578

Constitution to guide them. If the Justices are guided by the
franters' specific intent, they will necessarily undermine or
eliminate constitutional protections recognized or given
substance since the eighteenth century, some as recently as two
or three decades ago, for women, the poor, and minority groups.
It is impossible to ascertain the "intent" in all situations of
the men who wrote the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and all
later amendments until the 19th Amendment which gave women the
right to vote, but they certainly did not envision that their
protections would extend to women. The 18th century framers
expressly excluded women and African-Americans from such
protection. A framers' intent analysis is also worthless on
important issues for women that the framers could not even
imagine, such as conflicts over surrogate parenting and new
reproductive technologies.

          More is required from a Supreme Court Justice than a literal
understanding of laws. Laws are an embodiment of the values we
adhere to as a nation. The interpretation of those laws requires
a connection with the world we live in today. The beauty of the
 Constitution lies in its ideals of a free and just society. It
 continues to guide us, not because the framers were wiser than we
 are today, but because of those ideals. The Supreme Court needs
 justices who understand their obligation to apply those living
 ideals flexibly to modern society. Souter must be required to
 explain his beliefs about the ambit of equal protection of the
                               579

law and other vital constitutional guarantees.

SOUTER AND ABORTION

         Clearly, abortion, and the right to privacy more broadly,
will be issues upon which searching questioning will be required
at the hearings. Such questioning will not seek answers about
Souter's personal beliefs on abortion and contraception or his
views on particular pending cases - the irrelevant litmus test
President Bush unnecessarily fears - but must rather focus on
Souter's method of analysis of the Constitution and his
understanding, or lack thereof, of the fundamental nature of the
well-established privacy right.

          In Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Supreme Court
 recognized, by a 7 to 2 vote, that the fundamental right to
 privacy provided by the U.S. Constitution encompasses a woman's
 decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The decision
 cited and relied on earlier cases finding a constitutional right
 to privacy. Since the case was decided, Republican appointments
 to the Supreme Court have created a new conservative majority
 which places the Roe holding at risk. Justice White and now-
 Chief Justice Rehnquist were the two dissenting votes in Roe, and
 they have continued to uphold all statutes regulating abortion.
 In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. 109 S.Ct. 3040
                                 580

(1989), Justices White, Kennedy, and Rehnquist rejected further
use of the Roe trimester framework, Justice O'Connor called it
"problematic", and Justice Scalia stated that he wants to
overrule Roe v. Wade and eliminate the right of privacy that it
(and prior and subsequent cases) set forth.

         The justice who replaces Justice Brennan, a staunch advocate
of women's reproductive rights, could be the swing vote on future
abortion cases. As a state supreme court justice, Souter wrote
only once on reproductive rights. This decision, together with
his adoption of the framers' intent theory of constitutional
interpretation and the consistent deference he has shown as a
judge to the claimed right of states to legislate without
judicial monitoring, discussed below, warn us that he might
dismantle Roe v. Wade and our fundamental rights if given the
opportunity.

          While David Souter was a member of the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, the court issued an opinion in a medical malpractice case
which included a discussion of abortion, Smith v. Cote, 513 A.2d
 341 (N.H. 1986). Much of the media attention on this case has
 focused on the concurrence written by Souter; however, a close
 analysis of the majority opinion is also warranted, since Souter
 joined in both its holding and its reasoning.

           In Smith v. Cote, a woman sued her obstetrician for failing
                                  581

to warn her of the potential birth defects her child could suffer
as the result of the mother's exposure to rubella during
pregnancy. The child was born severely disabled with congenital
rubella syndrome. Prior to ruling on the defendant's motion for
summary judgment, the trial court sought a ruling by the New
Hampshire Supreme Court on several issues, under a New Hampshire
procedure called an interlocutory review of questions.

         The state supreme court was asked to address the four
specific questions summarized below:

          A. Will New Hampshire law recognize a wrongful birth cause
                   of action against a physician who failed to test,
                   detect, and give counsel regarding the risks of
                   potential birth defects, thereby depriving the mother
                   of the information about rubella, based upon which she
                    might have decided to have an abortion?

          B.- If the answer to question A is in the affirmative, what
                    type of damages are recoverable?

          C. Will New Hampshire law recognize a cause of action for
                    wrongful life? (Wrongful life actions are brought by
                    the child suffering from birth defects; in contrast,
                    wrongful birth actions are brought by the child's
                    parents.)

          D. If the answer to question C is in the affirmative,
                    what general and specific damages may the child
                    recover?

               582

         The issue of abortion arose in the case in the context of
the potential wrongful birth cause of action. In explaining the
trend toward judicial acceptance of wrongful birth actions, the
majority opinion finds that there are two main causes for the
trend: medical advances which allow doctors to predict and detect
fetal defects; and the principles of choice in pregnancy outcomes
outlined in Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and later cases.
Based on these factors, the Court finds that a cause of action
for wrongful birth exists.

         Although the ultimate holding is pro-choice, the language
neither affirms nor supports women's privacy rights or any
fundamental right to choose abortion. Instead, the opinion is
replete with language that suggests that the outcome would be
very different if Roe v. Wade, a United States Supreme Court
case, were not controlling.

In Roe the Supreme Court held that the

constitutional right of privacy encompasses a

woman's decision whether to undergo an abortion.

Roe, 410 U.S. at 153, 93 S.Ct. at 726. During the

first trimester of pregnancy, a woman may make

this decision as she sees fit, free from state

interference. Id. at 163, 93 S.ct. at 731. The

Court has repeatedly adhered to this holding in

the face of regulatory attempts to circumscribe

the Roe right of privacy. See, e.g., Thornburgh

v. American College of Obstetricians and

Gynecologists  U.S. , 106 S.Ct 2169, 90

L.Ed.2d 799 (1986). As we indicated above, we

believe that Roe is controlling; we do not hold

that our decision would be the same in its

absence.

               11
                                  583

Cote. 513 A.2d at 346 (emphasis added). Later in the opinion,
the court once again makes it clear that it does not
independently support this fundamental right:

                   Notwithstanding the disparate views within society
                   on the controversial practice of abortion, we are
                   bound by the law that protects a woman's right to
                   choose to terminate her pregnancy.

Cote. 513 A.2d at 348. This majority opinion is joined and
accepted by David Souter. By writing a separate concurrence, he
had an opportunity to base his holding on different reasons or to
state his views on the constitutional basis of Roe, but he did
neither. Instead, he agreed with the majority's subtle attack on
abortion rights and went on to address the needs and concerns of
doctors morally opposed to abortions. This anti-choice issue was
 totally unrelated to the facts presented in Smith v. Cote and
 was not raised, briefed or argued by either of the parties.

          Furthermore, there is no explanation as to why Souter
 raised this issue at all, other than the statement in his
 concurrence that the directed "questions fail to raise a
 significant issue in the area of malpractice litigation that we
 raise today." Cote. 513 A.2d at 355. This was not, however, a
 burning issue in the medical community, a community with which
 Souter was familiar. Souter served as a board member of Concord
 Hospital and as an overseer to the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical

                                                              12
                                 584

Center. Interviews with other members of those boards published
in a July 25, 1990 article in the Manchester, New Hampshire Union
Leader, provide evidence that this issue never arose in the
context of hospital meetings.

         This is judicial activism of the type we have been told that
Souter rejects. In the judicial questionnaire he completed for
the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to questioning for his
federal judicial appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit, Souter wrote: "The obligation of any judge is to
decide the case before the court, and the nature of the issue
presented will largely determine the appropriate scope of the
principle on which its decision should rest." In Cote, the New
Hampshire Supreme Court was given a very specific area of
inquiry, and Souter's concurrence clearly exceeds that boundary.
Thus, the questions become, is Souter a judicial activist to the
detriment of the rights of women, minority and other
disenfranchised groups? How does Souter equate his statement of
principle to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his practice?

              In the Cote concurrence itself, Souter affirms that women
have the right to abortion counselling, but only because it is
 "necessarily permitted under Roe v. Wade". Cote. 513 A.2d at
 355. He then discusses what is the appropriate course of action
 for physicians with "conscientious scruples against abortion."
 Cote. 513 A.2d at 355. He finds that a physician must consider

                                                             13
                                 585

counselling about abortion as an option because of Roe, but the
physician does not have to provide such counselling personally.
Doctors in this situation should disclose their moral convictions
and refer the patient to another physician.

          Souter's response to the possible conflict between pregnant
women and physicians opposed to abortion is reasonable, but he
clearly went out of his way to address this hypothetical.
Moreover, it is notable that in the entire opinion, majority and
concurrence, there is no indication from Souter that he believes
that the woman's right to choose arises from any fundamental
 right or constitutional imperative.

          Souter's other significant writing on abortion was completed
 when he was a superior court judge. In 1981, the New Hampshire""^
 legislature was considering a bill requiring parental consent for
 abortions on unmarried minors. Under the pending bill, an
 abortion could be performed on an unmarried minor without
 parental consent only when a justice of the superior court
 determined that performing the abortion would be in the best
 interests of an immature minor. Souter, writing a letter to the
 legislature at its request on behalf of the members of the
 superior court, addressed the constitutionality of the judicial
 bypass option contained in the bill.

           This letter is curious not only for the issues it addresses,
                                 586

but also for those left unanswered. The judges refused to take a
position on parental consent but did find two fundamental
problems with the bypass provisions. The first was that the
bill left it to judges "to make fundamental moral decisions about
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the
individual judge." In many ways this posture is puzzling. The
standard the bill envisions is one frequently used when cases
involve minors: the best interests of the minor. Other applicable
standards would be those set forth in Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113
(1973), and many later cases which created a framework for
ensuring protection of the rights to privacy of all women.
Souter's letter does not distinguish this situation from many
others in which the judiciary is forced to make similar decisions
by balancing interests, such as child custody cases.

         The second problem anticipated by Souter was judge shopping.
The letter anticipated that minors would try to avoid judges who
find abortion morally wrong and judges who believe that the
assessment of the best interests of the pregnant minor requires
moral decision-making of a type the judge should not make. There
 is no mention of the constitutional validity of the parental
consent bill without a judicial bypass and no suggestion of a
 simple recusal procedure to ensure that only unbiased judges
 would sit.

          In analyzing a judicial bypass provision, Souter
                                  587

inexplicably restricted his response to a discussion about
judges. There is no real discussion of the minor who would be
involved in the process. It is the discomfort of judges rather
than the hardship of young women which garners all the
attention. The focus is entirely on the problems faced by
anti-choice judges who are unable to fulfil their judicial
responsibility to put aside their personal biases, rather than
on the problems of minors facing perhaps the most important
decision of their lives. Even assuming the judges felt they were
not knowledgeable enough to write about pregnant minors, Souter's
analysis is chillingly lacking in compassion and empathy.

          Although the tone of this letter is anti-choice, in practice
 it was an important tool in the fight against parental consent
 laws in New Hampshire. This letter was used to defeat parental
consent legislation on several occasions because many parental
consent supporters would not vote for a bill without a judicial
 bypass option. The Supreme Court recently clarified in Hodgson
 v. Minnesota. 58 U.S.L.W. 4957 (U.S. June 25, 1990), that a
 parental consent bill is unconstitutional without a bypass
 provision, but Justice Brennan provided the fifth vote for the
 plurality on this point.

          The final written evidence on Souter's abortion position is
 more tenuous. In 1976, the New Hampshire Attorney General's
 Office submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First
                                  588

Circuitva brief which argued that the state should not provide
Medicaid funds to pay for what the brief alleged that New
Hampshire residents see as the "killing of the unborn." (Coe v.
Hooker. Civil Nos. 75-206, 75-244, 75-253.) The assistant
attorney general who wrote the brief, upon which Souter's name
also appears, denies speaking with Souter specifically about the
brief. Given the small size of New Hampshire's Attorney
General's office and the importance of the case, however, it is
likely that the assistant attorney general was reducing to
writing what was office policy. The fact that Souter's staff
filed a brief containing such explicit anti-choice rhetoric
reflects either his failure as a professional to supervise his
direct subordinates on an important policy matter, or else his
willingness to adopt biased extreme rhetoric against women and to
argue that alleged majority opinion should override fundamental
rights, in direct contravention of the Constitution's mandate.

          The preceding opinions appear to constitute Souter's
writings on abortion and reproductive rights. The following
 analysis of other cases is integral to prediction of how Souter
would rule on any future abortion and women's rights cases.

 LEGISLATIVE DEFERENCE IN SOUTER'S OPINIONS

              Another disturbing trend in Souter's opinions is a marked
                                 589

deference to legislative judgment, even when the legislation is

quite restrictive of individual rights. He also believes, as

noted above, that the Constitution should be interpreted solely

by reference to the fraraers' intent, an analysis which precludes

intermediate scrutiny of sex-based classifications under the

equal clause, which has been guaranteed only since the 1970s.

Moreover, he sometimes applies an overly strained and technical

interpretation of the law.

          These tendencies may be critical in any prospective abortion

 case. The more recent Supreme Court pronouncements, while

 maintaining Roe, have allowed states to legislate more and more
 restrictions on a woman's right to choose.1 Thus, even if

 Souter has no personal or professional bias against abortion,

 which is unlikely, he can be very dangerous if he continues his

 pattern of unqualified judicial deference to the other branches

             1 The executive branch under the Reagan/Bush
 administrations has also been attempting to regulate and restrict
 access to abortion. One example of this type of executive
 regulation is the current abortion rights case pending before
 the Supreme Court. In Rust v. Sullivan. Nos. 89-1391, 89-1392,
 at issue are Title X federal family planning regulations which
 prohibit physicians at clinics receiving Title X funding from
 discussing the- option of abortion with their patients. If the
 patient inquires about an abortion, the response must be, "The
 project does not consider abortion an appropriate method of
  family planning and therefore does not cousel or refer for
 abortion." 42 C.F.R. To let regulations like this stand is to
 make reproductive choice a mere illusion for low income women
 with no funds to seek unbiased medical counsel. Rust may also be
  the type of case which provides the court the next opportunity
  to overturn Roe v. Wade. If Souter is intellectually consistent,
  his reasoning in Smith v. Cote. 513 A.2d 341 (N.H. 1986), would
  require him to either to find the Title X regulations
  unconstitutional or to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.
                                    590

   of government.

             As described above, in In Re Dionne, 518 A.2d 178 (N.H.
   1986), Souter is willing to give a great deal of deference to
   legislative decisions, even if those decisions were made
   hundreds of years ago. Another case in which the legislative
   branch was given undue consideration is In Appeal of Bosselait.
    547 A.2d 682 (N.H. 1988). Souter, writing for a unanimous court,
   upheld a law that required unemployed workers to be available for
' a full-time job to qualify for New Hampshire's unemployment
    compensation. The plaintiffs, two elderly brothers in their
    seventies, had been denied unemployment compensation after losing
    the full-time janitorial job they had shared for 22 years. Both
    brothers could only work part-time because of health problems.
    Souter rejected their age discrimination claim, because it had
    not been adequately raised at the lower level, and rejected their
    disability discrimination claim because the plaintiffs' inability
    to work longer hours due to their age did not constitute a
    "handicap".

              Souter also addressed the plaintiffs' equal protection
    argument. He found that the requirement of availability for
     full-time employment as a condition for receiving unemployment
    compensation did not violate the state equal protection rights of
    those who were only able to work part-time.

                                                                 19
                               591

         Employing the rational relation standard, Souter found that
the plaintiff brothers would have to prove "that the restriction
of benefits to those able and willing to accept full-time work is
not rationally related to the advancement of any legitimate
governmental interest." Bosselait. 547 A.2d at 690. The court
held that the plaintiffs did not meet this burden because the
state had two legitimate government interests which it found were
rationally served by the statute. The first was to conserve
government funds for the benefit of those who need them the most.
Souter found it reasonable for the government to conclude that
unemployed people available to work full-time would be the most
needy based on the assumption that those only able to work part-
time must have another source of income.

          The second government interest was in limiting unemployment
 payments to the shortest time possible. Souter wrote that the
 restriction to persons available to take a full-time job
 accomplished this end because the government stated that there
 are more full-time jobs available and thus, a person is likely to
 get a full-time job more quickly than a part-time job.

           Souter's opinion contains no discussion of the validity of
 either of these ideas, and no supportive evidence. While
 rational relationship scrutiny often results in the upholding of
 statutes, this case is notably overly deferential to government
 rationales. Unemployed people who can only work part-time
                                  592

because of disability, age or responsibility for care-giving to
children or the elderly are likely to be at least as needy if
not more needy than those available for full-time work, and no
more likely to have additional sources of income. The court does
not even consider the possibility of partial payments to part-
time employees. The opinion seems to grasp any legislative
reason to uphold the regulation. It is not enough for the
judiciary merely to require statement of some alleged reasons for
legislative actions; the judiciary must truly judge how
rationally the statute and interests are related.

ABSTRACT REASONING IN SOUTER'S OPINIONS

          While Souter has been hailed for his presumed legal acumen,
his opinions demonstrate a tendency to take abstract reasoning to
an unreasonable level. People are not machines. Any legal
analysis which fails to take the realities of normal people's
daily lives into account risks undermining the law and can lead
to absurd conclusions.

          State v. Penney. 536 A.2d 1242 (N.H. 1987) is a typical
 case illustrating this error. In Penney, the defendant was
 arrested for drunk driving and given Miranda warnings. He
 refused to take a blood alcohol test but was not specifically
 informed that his refusal could be used against him at trial. He

                                                             21
                                  593

was advised that a refusal could result in license revocation.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed Denney's conviction,
finding that his due process rights under the state constitution
were violated when his refusal to take the test was admitted into
evidence at trial. Justice Souter dissented. He felt that the
Miranda warning that "any statement could and would be used
against him" should have been sufficient to inform the defendant
that his refusal to take the test would be used against him, even
though immediately prior to the test he was informed of only one
consequence of refusal: loss of license. Souter's argument is
based on abstract legal thinking and ignores the fact that most
of the population has not been taught to think like a lawyer.
After being told, at a separate time, that any statement may be
 used against you, most people, as the majority realized, would
 not understand that such statements include a negative response
 to a later police reguest to take a test.

 STEREOTYPICAL VIEWS OF WOMEN IN SOUTER'S OPINIONS

         Souter also appears to have an anachronistic and
 stereotypical view of women. The most glaring example is in the
 case of New Hampshire v. Colbath, 547 A.2d 682 (N.H. 1987). In
 Colbath. the defendant was convicted of aggravated felonious
  sexual assault. The defendant met the victim in a tavern. They
 went to the defendant's trailer, where he raped her. The
                               594

defendant's girlfriend came upon them and violently assaulted
the victim.

         The court admitted evidence by a state witness that the
victim had left the tavern in the company of various men during
the afternoon and had been "hanging over" men and "making out"
with the defendant and others, but would not allow defense
witnesses to testify about the victim's behavior. In his jury
instructions, the trial judge stated that the testimony presented
about the victim's conduct was not relevant to the issue of
consent.

         Writing for a unanimous court, Souter found that the jury
should have been allowed to consider the victim's behavior
toward men other than the defendant in the hours preceding the
incident. He found the defendant had a right to have the jury
consider the victim's "sexually provocative behavior" toward the
group, which he considered relevant to the issue of consent.
Souter intimated that, given the facts that intercourse was not
denied by the defendant and that all the victim's injuries could
possibly be explained by the defendant's girlfriend's attack on
 the victim, he believed that the victim might have falsely
 accused the defendant of rape to explain her "undignified
 predicament."

          This case required Souter to interpret New Hampshire's rape
                                 595

shield law. Rape shield laws were introduced in response to the
injustices inflicted on rape victims as a consequence of gender
bias and stereotypical notions about women prevalent in the
criminal justice system. It is a basic rule of evidence that
irrelevant information is inadmissible. Yet without rape shield
laws, many trial judges fail to understand why the victim's prior
sexual history is irrelevant. The stereotypical view is that a
woman's prior sexual activity is relevant because a woman who
will have sex with one man is more likely to consent to have sex
with another and that a woman who has had sex with a number of
men is not a credible witness. It was in response to this type
of thinking that rape shield laws limiting admissible testimony
about the victim's sexual history were designed. However, these
 laws are typically designed not to be an absolute bar, but to
 yield to the rights of the defendant if in the view of the trial
 judge, exclusion of such evidence would unduly prejudice the
 defendant's case. The irony of such provisions is that they
 leave the ultimate decision to the same trial judges who are
 often unable to understand why the evidence was irrelevant in the
 first place.

           Colbath was not a case of first impression in interpretation
 of the rape shield law in New Hampshire. The rape shield law was
 first interpreted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in People v.
 Howard. 426 A.2d 457 (N.H. 1981), before Souter was appointed to
 the court. In Howard, the court ruled that the defendant must be
                                  596

given the opportunity to prove that the probative value of the
victim's prior sexual activity outweighs its prejudicial effect
on the victim. At first blush, this holding appears reasonable,
but subsequent cases demonstrate that the New Hampshire courts
tend to give an unusual and offensive degree of latitude to
defense proffers of evidence of the victims' sexual history. See
Baker v. Cavanauqh. 508 A.2d 1059 (1986).

         In Colbath. Souter showed exactly this sort of insensitlvity
and stereotyped thinking about rape victims. He found that
evidence of the victim's flirting with another man suggested a
"contemporaneous receptiveness to sexual advances," and that
perhaps the victim falsely accused the defendant of rape as a way
to excuse her "undignified predicament." Such language is
unacceptable in any context. The case could have been decided on
the basis of the interpretation of the state rape shield law with
simple language to the effect that exclusion of the evidence
would unduly prejudice the defendant's case, without speaking at
length and in such derogatory terms about the victim. The
 language is reminiscent of the age-old stereotype that women are
either "whores" or "madonnas" and that any woman who flirts with
one man is sexually available to all men.

          Souter's bias is also shown in Colbath in the facts he
 discloses in the opinion and those he leaves out. His recitation
 of the facts essentially presents the defendant's point of view.

                                                             25
                               597

This is peculiar because any factual disputes had been resolved
by the trial jury, which chose to believe the victim and
convicted the defendant. His opinion fails to mention the facts
in the trial record that the victim had gone to the tavern to
meet her sister, that she had sat on the lap of an old friend for
approximately five minutes, that she was talking with the
defendant about a recent fight with her boyfriend when they went
 to his trailer for a quieter place, and that the defendant's
 girlfriend, whose attack could supposedly explain the victim's
 bruises on her breast and upper arms, was several inches shorter
 than the victim and had filed several assault arid domestic
 violence complaints against the defendant. Finally, Souter fails
 to mention that the victim displayed all the classic symptoms of
 rape trauma.2 (From Hoffman, Rape: Judge Souter for the
 Defense. Village Voice, Aug. 7, 1990, at 2 4 ) .

           Bias held by a judge is likely to permeate all of her or his
 decisions. If a Supreme Court justice cannot view women free of
 stereotypical notions of propriety, it is unlikely that the
 justice can decide cases on a host of other issues in such a

           2 Souter's holding for the defense in Colbath is also
 unusual in that in most of his other criminal law opinions he
  finds for the state and the prosecution. See State v. Koppel,
  127 N.H. 286 (1985), in which Souter dissented from an opinion
  which held roadblocks to catch drunk drivers a violation of the
  Fourth Amendment and Coppola v. Powell. 130 N.H. 148, 536 A.2d
  1236 (1987) rev'd in Coppola v. Powell. 878 F.2d 1562 (1st Cir.
  1989), in which Souter, writing for a unanimous court, found that
  the admission into evidence of the defendant's statement that he
  was too smart to confess to police was not a violation of the
  Fifth Amendment.

manner as to accord equal justice to women.

STEREOTYPICAL VIEWS OF FAMILY IN SOUTER'S OPINIONS

         Another area in which the appointment of a new Supreme Court
justice could have a significant impact on women's rights is
family law. Issues raised by surrogate parenting, newly-
discovered fertility methods, and non-traditional families may
reach the Supreme Court.

          As a member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Souter had
an opportunity to write on family law issues. Generally, his
opinions reflect traditional notions of family responsibility
and composition. The most controversial opinion is In Re Opinion
of the Justices. 430 A.2d 21 (N.H. 1987), in which the New
Hampshire Supreme Court held that it was not unconstitutional to
deny lesbians and gays the opportunity to become adoptive or
 foster parents.

          In In Re Opinion of the Justices, the New Hampshire Supreme
 Court was giving an advisory opinion on a proposed statute which
 would have prohibited lesbians and gays from adopting children,
 becoming foster parents, or running childcare centers. It would
 accomplish this end by denying a license to those foster parents
 and childcare applicants found to be "unfit by reason of being
                                  599

homosexual." The court was asked to rule on whether the bill
violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the
United States or the New Hampshire Constitutions^ and the right to
privacy.

         Although no author of the opinion is given, since Souter
joined in the majority, its reasoning can be imputed to him. The
court held that lesbians and gays constitute neither a suspect
class nor a "middle tier" requiring heightened scrutiny with
respect to questions of equal protection. Thus, the government
need only demonstrate a rational relation between the proposed
 legislation and a legitimate government purpose. The court found
that the need to provide appropriate role models is a rational
government purpose, the furtherance of which justifies the
 exclusion of lesbians and gays from adoptive and foster
 parenting. The opinion cites but then chooses to disregard
 several studies which show no connection between the sexual
 orientation of parents and the sexual orientation of their
 children.

          The court found that the bill did not violate due process
 because there is no property or liberty interest in being a
 foster or adoptive parent. The court also held that the bill did
 not violate the right to privacy, relying on the United States'
 Supreme Court's ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick. 478 U.S. 186,
  (1986). The Court held in that case that because there is "no
                                  600

connection between family, marriage, and procreation on one
hand, and homosexuality on the other hand."-Bowers. 106 S.Ct. at
2844, lesbian and gay sexual activity does not fit into the
Supreme Court's definition of privacy. The New Hampshire opinion
also rationalizes that, in the case of foster care and adoption,
there is no intrusion into a person's privacy because the person
voluntarily invites scrutiny by submitting an application.
Lastly, the bill was found not to violate the freedom of associa-
tion clause because, pursuant to Bowers. no freedom of associa-
tion for the purpose of engaging in lesbian or gay sexual
activity exists.

         The one aspect of the bill found to be unconstitutional is
the exclusion of lesbians and gays from employment as child care
workers. The court holds that this exclusion is not
sufficiently "rationally related" to the government purpose of
providing role models for children in state-licensed care because
the person holding the license to the facility is not necessarily
 in close enough contact with children to provide a model. Also
 in the childcare context, parents are responsible for making the
choice as to what is best for the child, whereas in a foster care
 or public adoption context, the state must do so.

          The basic assumption underlying this decision is that it
 would be bad public policy to allow children to become lesbians
 and gays. No evidence is offered to support this homophobic

                                                             29
                                601

proposition. Although, unfortunately, this reasoning is not
unique to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, it is a clear
indication that the opinion is based on bias rather than reason.
Other evidence of this fact is the acceptance of the proposition
that the sexual orientation of parents is the primary
determinant of their children's sexual orientation, in the face
of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. By joining this
opinion, Souter demonstrates that he does not always act as a
legal scholar ruled by facts and reason rather than bias and
emotion.

          The dissent written, by Judge Batchelder, indicates that the
New Hampshire Supreme Court received no relevant evidence

                    to show that homosexual parents endanger their
                    children's development of sexual preference,
                    gender role identity or general physical and
                    psychological health any more than any
                    heterosexual parents. The legislature received no
                    such evidence because apparently the overwhelming
                    weight of professional study concludes that no
                    difference in psychological and psychosexual
                    development can be discerned between children
                    raised by heterosexual parents and children raised
                    by homosexual parents.

 In Re Opinion of the Judges. 430 A.2d at 28. Disregarding the
 weight of the evidence, for illogical and emotional reasons, is
 not, we hope, the way in which Supreme Court Justices make
 decisions.
                                 602

         This opinion also exhibits a very narrow view of due
process. As Judge Batchelder's dissent indicates, the New
Hampshire Supreme Court had previously recognized that a person
may be entitled to due process "even when his or her interest was
not 'natural, essential, and inherent1," In Re Opinion of the
Judges. 430 A.2d at 28, and had even held that a person was
entitled to due process in a state athletic board's
determination of his eligibility to compete. Duffley v. New
Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association. 446 A.2d 462
(N.H. 1982). By refusing to hold that parenting is entitled to
some type of due process protection, the opinion essentially
holds that playing a sport is more fundamental than parenting a
child.

          Souter's other opinions on family law issues such as
divorce and child custody are unremarkable, because he has been
very reluctant to overrule the discretionary rulings made by the
 trial judge. They generally reflect traditional notions that the
 husband should support the family and the wife should be given
 custody of the children if she wants them. See Doubleday v
 Doubleday. 551 A.2d 525 (N.H. 1988), and Kayle v. Kayle, 565 A.2d
 1069 (N.H. 1989).

          While the obligation of both parents to support their
 children after divorce, and the resolution of custody disputes in
 favor of the primary caretaker before divorce (which in our

                                                             31
                                  603

culture frequently results in the mother gaining custody), are
ideas which should be embraced by the judicial system, it is
important that this stem from the recognition that both partners
share the responsibility to support and nurture their offspring,
and not merely from traditional notions that a man's role is to
provide financial support and a woman's role is that of nurturer.

          The ramifications of such traditional notions could be
tremendous. When the Supreme Court is asked to rule on modern
family law issues, it must do more than merely reaffirm what have
been our traditional notions of family. The Court must be
sufficiently open to receive and adopt evidence that the
traditional view is not necessarily the correct view.

 CONCLUSION

          The issues and concerns raised in this paper should serve as
 a starting point for intensive questioning of David Souter. As a
 prospective lifetime appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court,
 Souter's methods of constitutional and legislative analysis could
 determine the Court's views on life and liberty well into the
 next century. This is no single-issue litmus test but a question
 of his judicial philosophy. Particularly in the absence of any
 non-judicial legal writings, the American people have a right to
 demand that he answer questions about his judicial philosophy.

                                                              32
                                  604

David Souter must explain the ambit of his framers'intent
reliance and how he would apply framers' intent to modern issues
the framers could not foresee. He must address how a framers'
intent analysis functions within the concept of stare decisis.
The people also have a right to know whether David Souter is
committed to the fundamental constitutional principles of privacy
and equal protection of the law for women.

          If David Souter cannot or will not address these concerns,
he should not be confirmed.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Ms. Allred, proceed.

                     STATEMENT OF GLORIA ALLRED

  Ms. ALLRED. Good afternoon, Senator Specter, Senator Hatch,
Chairman Biden, Senator Kennedy, and Senator DeConcini. My
name is Gloria Allred. I am a Los Angeles attorney, representing
Norma McCorvey, who is here beside me today. Norma is better
known as Jane Roe, the plaintiff in the landmark Roe v. Wade de-
cision, and I am here today representing her in her efforts to
defend Roe v. Wade.

  Twenty years ago, Norma was young, pregnant, alone and afraid.
Unable to obtain an abortion in her home State of Texas, she spoke
to some local attorneys who agreed that it was fundamentally cruel
for her State to require her to endure an unwanted pregnancy.

  While Norma's pregnancy progressed, her attorneys challenged
Texas' anti-abortion criminal statute as a violation of her essential
constitutional right to privacy. To protect Norma and out of fear
for her safety, she was renamed Jane Roe in court papers and in
the press, and became an anonymous representative of millions of
American women who sought to control their own bodies, free of
Government intrusion.

  After years of legal struggling, Norma won her case. In 1973, the
United States Supreme Court handed down Roe v. Wade. In the
sweep of a pen, the Supreme Court promised all American women
that there would never again be another Jane Roe, beginning dis-
tant courts for the basic human right to decide for herself whether
to terminate a pernancy. Never again, the Court promised, may
the State presume to intrude on a decision so intimate and signifi-
cant that it may well determine the remainder of a young woman's
life.

  To Norma McCorvey, the decision was a hollow victory. For
Norma, our legal system had moved too slowly, and in the mean-
time she had been forced to endure the unspeakable pain of bear-
ing and giving birth to a child she could not keep. As Joe Roe, how-
ever, Norma rejoiced at the decision and she believed the Supreme
Court's promise to women for the future.

  As attorneys, as lawmakers, and as judges, our first questions
should be the effect of our decisions on real human lives. While
Roe v. Wade brought no relief to Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe's vic-
tory transformed the future for American women.

  As the years passed after Roe v. Wade, American women slowly
began to believe the Supreme Court's promise in Jane Roe's case.
Although some restrictions remained, primarily for poor women,
for the most part, women's choice to terminate a pregnancy was
protected by the courts. Back-alley abortionists disappeared,
women's death from unsafe and illegal abortions became just a sad
chapter in history, women's anguish in being forced to carry an un-
wanted pregnancy to term faded from memory.

  Yet, recently, because of the Webster decision, women have once
again been forced to live in fear. We know that the Court's decade-
old promise to us could be reversed with the sweep of a pan. We
know that the Court is now closely split on whether the promise
should or should not be kept.
                                      606

  We cannot pretend that these hearings exist outside of that con-
text. We cannot pretend that the question before this Senate Judi-
ciary Committee is simply whether Judge David Souter is a compe-
tent jurist. We know that the next Supreme Court Justice will
become the deciding vote in the Court's decision to either preserve
its promise to American women, that they will never again be
forced into illegal and, therefore, unsafe abortions, or to renege on
that promise. We know that the next Supreme Court Justice will
decide the fate of women into the next century.

  We, therefore, have one question about this and every future
nominee to the United States Supreme Court: Has this nominee
demonstrated a commitment to the Supreme Court's promise to
women in Roe v. Wade, or not?

  In these hearings, Judge David Souter has claimed that he has
not yet decided whether or not he would reverse Jane Roe's victory
of 17 years ago. He claims that he may or may not sign a decision
returning millions of women to the fear and second-class status of
20 years ago. Perhaps he would relegate women to back-alley abor-
tions and unwanted pregnancies. Perhaps not. He is not quite sure.

  This uncertainty, of course, has never been publicly expressed
before Judge Souter became a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Before he became a nominee, Judge Souter freely expressed ex-
tremist anti-abortion views. David Souter expressed no such lack of
resolve when he put his name to a 1976 brief, referring to abortion
as "the killing of unborn children." He did not claim to have a
"open mind," when he spoke out against repeal of New Hamp-
shire's criminal abortion law in 1977. And Judge Souter's newly
professed doubt was nowhere to be found in a 1986 New Hampshire
Supreme Court decision, in which he went out of his way to ex-
press sympathy with doctors opposed to abortion.

  But let us take Judge Souter at his word and assume that he
truly never has considered the question of whether American
women should have the right to decide for themselves whether to
bring an unwanted pregnancy to term. Let us assume further that
Judge Souter is an able judge. A lifetime appointment to the U.S.
Supreme Court should to be granted, based upon a professed "open
mind" or mere technical competence.

  In that seat should sit a judge who has proved a lifetime of dedi-
cation to the highest principles a Supreme Court judge is sworn to
protect, self-determination, equality and dignity for every member
of our society. This body should not be ashamed to insist upon the
highest caliber of excellence, and firm evidence that a nominee will
preserve and defend essential human rights, before confirming that
nominee.

  Unfortunately, Judge Souter has not made that commitment to
women. For example, among many reasons that could be cited, a
very important one is that Judge Souter openly and unequivocally
has testified at these hearings that he would not apply "the strict
scrutiny test" on the issue of women's right to equal protection.
This clearly signifies that, if confirmed, he would treat women as
second-class citizens, to whom he would afford fewer constitutional
protections than he would afford to blacks and other minorities.
Women know that only a judge with a keener sense of the impor-
tance of women's rights to decide their own destinies, a judge that
                                      607

has demonstrated a commitment to women's right to choose, is en-
titled to the highest privilege of occupying that pivotal Supreme
Court seat.

  We know that, unfortunately, Judge David Souter is not that
judge. The Senate should not confirm a nominee that it cannot
wholeheartedly endorse as meeting these most rigorous standards.

  Ms. Roe and I, therefore, recommend and respectfully urge that
you reject the nomination of Judge David Souter to the United
States Supreme Court.

  I thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. Thank you very much for your testi-
mony.
  Ms. ALLRED. And may I say that I am sorry I did not have a
chance to say greetings and hello to Senator Simon, whom I know.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  Ms. ALLRED. May I also ask, Chairman Biden, if I may put into
evidence Roe v. Wade, because it may be the last time that we ever
see it in its present form. I would like to know if I could attach
that as an exhibit to my testimony.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you may.

  Ms. ALLRED. Thank you very much, sir. Ms. McCorvey will be
available to answer any questions, when you are ready.

  Thank you.

Ideology, Judicial Selection and Judicial Ethics

ERWIN CHEMERINSKY*

   In the fail of 1986, there was a bitter fight against the retention of three
members of the California Supreme Court, Rose Bird, Joseph Grodin, and
Cruz Reynoso. Exactly a year later, the nation's attention focused on the
battle over Robert Bork's confirmation to the United States Supreme Court.
There were ironic parallels between these two events. In both instances, pub-
lic opinion and media reporting played an unprecedented role in the judicial
selection process. In each situation, there were arguments over whether the
candidates' ideology should be a major factor in the evaluations.

                        Liberals in California argued that assuring judicial inde-

pendence required that the evaluation be limited to the justices' competence;

that the individuals' ideology and prior votes should play no role in the re-

tention election. But the sides were reversed in tflMMMMBtfMHMMWM

that evaluation should be limited to the nominee's competence--that his ide-

ology and prior votes should play no role in the Senate's confirmation

decision.

rhetoric. If jjnp |n nil kill liriHTfihi liiffti jiniiWHi iilmii ni'^nTiTfrrMTITri'P

as an issue in your arguments; bat if your candidate's positions ate against

the weight of public opinion, you maintain that ideology is irrelevant and

that judicial candidates should be evaluated solely on the basis of profes-

sional qualifications.

Such an appraisal, while an accurate description of the recent «vents, ig-

nores the crucial underlying question of how judicial candida£e& taoeld be

evaluated. The issue will certainTy arise in the future, \f^rfto?&$<&:taaot^
than that ideology was successfully used to defeat Bird, Bork/Gfoffin, and*

Reynoso. Moreover, the simultaneous election of George Bush as President

and of a Democratically controlled Senate will likely lead to conflicts over

judicial nominees. While the experiences of the past two years are still fresh

in mind, it is important to consider what criteria should be used in evaluating

candidates for judicial office. Many scholars have criticized the Senate's re-

jection of Bork and the California voters' rejection of Bird, Grodin, and Rey-

noso.' Are these objections valid? If so, how should the process of
evaluating judicial candidates be conducted?

                                               Allowing such ideological evaluation
 raises the question of how a person's ideology can be ascertained; what ques-
 tions may prospective judges be required to answer? The basis for ideological
 evaluation is discussed in part III. Finally, part IV considers whether such
an approach to judicial selection is consistent with the current standards of
judicial ethics and, if not, what changes should be made.

   This article does not directly address the issue of what system for selecting
judges--elections or appointments--is best2 Rather,

The phrase "judiaaTcandidate" is used throughout this article to refer to a
person being considered for any state or federal judicial office. Whether the
evaluator is the President, the Senate, a governor, a state legislator, or a
voter, the underlying issue is essentially the same: what are the permissible
grounds for evaluating potential judges?

              I. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO EVALUATING JUDGES

   I can identify three different models that have been advanced as to how
judicial candidates should be selected and evaluated. Each has its strong
supporters. One might be termed the professional qualifications model.
Under this approach, candidates for judicial office--state or federal--should
be evaluated only on the basis of their credentials: their education, the nature
of their legal practice, their prior judicial experience, and any other indicia of
their competence and ability to serve as a judge. The professional qualifica-
tions model expressly excludes consideration of an individual's ideology or
likely voting in particular cases.

   For the most part, the criteria used by the American Bar Association in
evaluating nominees reflect this model. The American Bar Association's rat-
ing of a judicial candidate is based on the individual's "character, tempera-
ment, and professional aptitude and experience"; evaluation is not supposed

ing Boricrejection);Udman, California Judicial Retention Elections, 28 SANTA CLARA L. REV. 333
(1988) (criticizing rejection of California Supreme Court Justices in 1986 retention election).

  2. However, I do discuss whether differences in the method of selection justify differences in the
criteria used in evaluation. See infra text accompanying notes 30-31.
       645

to include consideration of the individual's views or ideology.3 The Twenti-
eth Century Fund's Task Force on Judicial Selection recently declared that
"choosing candidates for anything other than their legal qualifications dam-
ages the public's perception of the institutional prestige of the judiciary and
calls into question the high ideal of judicial independence."4

   Supporters of both Bird and Bork argued that this was the model to be
used and that each should be approved because of excellent professional
qualifications.5 For example, Professor Bruce Ackerman described the rejec-
tion of Robert Bork as a "tragedy" on the grounds that Bork was "among
the best qualified candidates for the Supreme Court of this or any other era.
Few nominees in our history compare with him in the range of their profes-
sional accomplishments."6

   A second approach can be termed the judging skills model. Under this
approach, in addition to professional qualifications, it is permissible for the
evaluator--be it the voter, the Executive, or the Senate--to examine the can-
didate's skills as a judge, assuming that the candidate has served in a prior
judicial position. Supporters of this approach look to factors such as the
judicial candidate's use of precedent, the quality of his or her written opin-
ions, his or her temperament on the bench, and the like. As with the profes-
sional qualifications approach, the judging skills model expressly excludes
consideration of an individual's ideology in evaluating potential judges.

   For example, Professor Michael Moore argued against the retention of
Chief Justice Rose Bird, but expressly disclaimed that his position was based
on an ideological disagreement.7 Professor Moore maintained that Chief
Justice Bird should have been rejected because he believed that her vote to
reverse every death penalty case to come before her reflected closed-minded-
ness and impermissibly result-oriented judging.8 Similarly, Professor Judith
Resnick in her Senate testimony against Robert Bork focused on his judging
skills and not on his ideology.' She specifically criticized the breadth of his

 opinions and his resolution of questions net raised m the specific cases before
 him.10

    A third approach can be termed the ideological orientation model.
 Although this model certainly includes evaluation of professional qualifica-
 tions and judging skills, it differs from the irst two approaches because it
 expressly permits consideration of an individual's ideology in the selection
 process. Specifically, the evaluator is allowed to examine a judicial candi-
 date's views on important issues in deciding whether to approve or reject the
 individual. Many of the critics of both Bird and Bork employed this model.
 Chief Justice Bird, for example, was opposed for her opposition to capital
 punishment and also for her liberal rulings protecting consumers and em-
 ployees.11 Judge Bork was attacked for his writings criticizing Supreme
 Court cases protecting the right of privacy, applying the equal protection
clause to gender discrimination, and using the First Amendment to protect
speech not concerned with the political process.12 In short, the debates over
Bird and Bork were primarily battles over which of these three models
should be followed. The model selected determines the appropriate criteria
for evaluation.

   It must be recognized that, as with any such models, these are only de-
scriptions of approaches in very general terms. Within each there are many
specific questions that must be answered, including: how to appropriately
measure professional qualifications; how to evaluate judging behavior; what
are the permissible ways for determining ideology? Also, it is not always
possible in practice to neatly separate the models. Professional qualifications
are looked to, in large part, as a way of predicting judging skills.

   Admittedly, the^e three models are oversimplifications. However, they do
provide a basis for analysis and discussion. The starting place in evaluating a
judicial candidate must be a decision as to which approach should be used.

                                        II. IDEOLOGY MATTERS

   I contend that the evaluation ofjudicial candidates--by the President or a
governor, by the Senate or the voters--should include consideration of ideol-
ogy. That is, in deciding whether to appoint, approve, or retain a judge,
consideration should include examination of the individual's professional

qualifications, his or her judging skills, and also, his or her ideology. It is

appropriate and necessary to focus on the individual's views on important

issues that are likely to come before his or her court. It is acceptable and, in

fact, essential that the evaluator reject a nominee whose views are deemed to

be objectionable.

At first blush, this might appear to be a radical suggestion. I contend,

however, that it is the description which best describes how judicial candi-

dates have been evaluated throughout American history. Early in American

history, President George Washington appointed John Rutledge to be the
second Chief Justice of the United States.13 Rutledge was impeccably quali-

Jied; he already had been confirmed by the Senate as an Associate Justice

(although he never actually sat in that capacity). The Senate rejected Rut-

ledge for the position of Chief Justice because of its disagreement with Rut-

ledge's views on the United States treaty with Great Britain. Furthermore,

throughout the nineteenth century, the Senate rejected many nominees on

ideological grounds. Professor Grover Rees explains that "during the nine-

teenth century only four Supreme Court Justices were rejected on the ground

that they lacked the requisite credentials, whefgas seventeen were rejected for

pn1»rir3j|_or philosophical reasons?"1*  ~^ ""*"""' -*=**-·

      " LokewiseT during this century, Presidential nominees for the Supreme
     Court have been rejected even when they possess outstanding professional
    qualifications. In 1930. a federal^ court of appeals judge, John Parker, was
    denied a seat on the highJgourT because ol his anti-labor, anti-civil rights
   "views." Li 1969, Ule Senatepejecled,United States appeals courfjudge Clem-
    ent Haysworth largely because_of his anti-union vTews^3^Tj[jjS the defeat of

   Of course, such a description is not a normative defense of the appropriate-
ness of considering ideology in evaluating nominees. The ideological orienta-
tion model can be defended in the simplest terms: ideology should be
considered because ideology matters. Judges are not fungible; a person"s"13gr
ology influences how he or she wJT vote on important issues. It is appropriate
tor an evaluator to pay careful attention to the luceiy consequences of an
individual's presence on a court.

   In defending the ideological orientation model, it is useful to begin with a
thought experiment. Imagine that the President appoints someone who it

   turns out is an active member of the Klu Klux Klan or the American Nazi
   party and who had repeatedly expressed racist and anti-semitic views. As-
   sume that the nominee has impeccable professional qualifications: a degree
   from a prestigious university, years of experience in high level law practice,
   and a strong record of bar service. I would think that virtually everyone
   would agree that the nominee should be rejected.

     Presidents and governors have always sdectetTnominees because of their
  ideology. Governor Jerry Brown selected Rose Bird because of their ideologi-
  cal compatibility. President Reagan nominated Robert Bork precisely be-
  cause of Bork's conservative views. Accordingly, the evaluators--the voters
  or the Senate--are justified in also looking to ideology.

     Early in this century, the legal realists exploded the myth that judging is
  discretion-free and that formalism is possible. Judges often possess substan-
  tial discretion--especially in interpreting aa expansively worded document
  like the Constitution-Jdeology inevitably iniuences the exercise of that dis-
cretion, A study published in the Columbia Law Review examined the voting"
  patterns of federal court of appeals judges.17 It revealed that judges ap-
  pointed by Democratic presidents vote in favor of the government in civil
  cases less than forty percent of the time.1* In contrast, judges appointed by
  Republican presidents vote in favor of the government over sixty percent of
  the time." Particularly in civil rights cases, Democratic judges vote in favor
  of the plaintiff more often than do Republican judges/** For purposes of
  comparison, this study found that a group of conservative court of appeals

 Hence, they should pay attention to the effects of their judicial choices on the
 matters that concern them the most.

    Opponents to the ideological orientation model must sustain one of two
 arguments: either that an individual's ideology is unlikely to affect his or her
 decisions on the bench, or that even if ideology will influence decisions, it
 should not be examined because disadvantages to such consideration will
outweigh any advantages.

   The former argument, that a person's ideology is unlikely to affect per-
formance in office, is impossible to sustain. Unless one believes in truly
mechanistic judging, it is clear that judges possess discretion and that the
exercise of discretion is strongly influenced by an individual's pre-existing
ideological beliefs. For example, in cases involving questions of constitu-
tional or statutory interpretation, the language of the document and the in-
tent of the drafters often will be unclear.22 Thus judges will often be required
to supply the meaning. Moreover, in common law cases courts are left to
decide the appropriate content of judicially created documents. Many cases,
especially in constitutional law, involve a balancing of interests. The relative
weight assigned to the respective claims often turns on the judge's own val-
ues. Given the reality of the judicial decisionmaking process, it is difficult to
support the claim that a judge's ideology will not impact his or her decision.

   The latter argument against considering a judicial candidate's views is
much stronger: that even though ideology matters, the ideological model
should not be followed because of its undesirable effects. Several disadvan-
tages of the ideological orientation model have been advanced. The most
forceful of these arguments is that it will undermine judicial independence.
Professor Stephen Carter argues that considering a nominee's views on ques-
tions of constitutional theory threatens judicial independence.23 Professor
Carter contends that the Supreme Court exists as a counter-majoritarian in-
stitution and that its ability to protect the Constitution's values from the
excesses of majority rule is likely to be jeopardized by intense scrutiny of
judicial candidates. He states that

      [i]f a nominee's ideas fall within the very broad range of judicial views that
      are not radical in any non-trivial sense--and Robert Bork has as much '
      right to that middle ground as any other nominee in recent decades--the
      Senate enacts a terrible threat to the independence of the judiciary if a
      substantive review of the nominee's legal theories brings about a
      rejection.24

threat to judicial independence. See supra note 4.

          The critical weakness in Professor Carter's argument is that it is not clear
       why judicial independence requires blindness to ideology during the nomina-
       tion or confirmation of a federal judge. Professor Carter maintains that inde-
       pendence requires protection of individuals from scrutiny from the earliest
       moments of the selection process. According to Carter:

             Judicial independence, if the concept is to have any force, is not a cloak
             that can be thrown around a new Justice at the very last minute--after the
            administration of the oath. Independence must arrive earlier, and cover all
            potential nominees, from the moment that sitting Justice retires or dies. A
            nominee is not independent when she is quizzed, openly or not, on the
            degree of her reverence for particular precedents.25

          However, judicial independence means that a judge should feel free to de-
       cide cases according to his or her view of the law and not in response to
       popular pressure. As such, Article Ill's assurance of life tenure and its pro-
       tection against a reduction in salary guarantee independence. Judges are free
       to decide each case according to their conscience and best judgment; they
       need not worry that their rulings will cost them their seats or their salary.
       Professor Carter never indicates why this is insufficient to preserve judicial
       independence. In the above quotation, he subtly shifts the definition of inde-
       pendence, from autonomy while in office to autonomy from scrutiny before
       being in office. But he does not explain why the latter, freedom from evalua-
       tion before ascending to the bench, is a prerequisite to independence in the
       former, far more meaningful sense.

-v \ In fact, it is precisely because federal judges are essentially immune from
·Jl /external checks once they are on the bench that it is essential that they be
J \ carefully scrutinized prior to their confirmation. Much of constitutional

       scholarship in the last quarter of a century has focused on what Professor
       Alexander Bickel termed the "counter-majoritarian difficulty"--the exercise
       of substantial power by unelected judges.26 Perhaps the most significant
      majoritarian check is at the nomination and confirmation stage. After judges
      are on the bench, judicial independence is essential for all of the reasons Pro-
      fessor Carter describes. He implicitly assumes that preserving the counter-
      majoritarian function of the courts requires complete exclusion of all
      majoritarian influences at any point in the system. Not only is this impossi-
      ble, but it is quite undesirable. Selection by the President and confirmation
      by the Senate properly exists precisely to have some majoritarian influence
      over the composition of the federal courts.27

         Finally, Professor Carter's position requires that both the President and

     Congress avoid examining an individual's ideology. If preserving the Court's
     function as an anti-majoritarian body requires, as Professor Carter argues,
     blindness to ideology, then all in the process must avoid attention to ideol-
     ogy. In fact, if the President appoints an individual reflecting the majority's
     views on an important issue, an aggressive Senate role permits Senators rep-
     resenting minority viewpoints to provide a check. At minimum, so long as
     the President considers ideology, there is a majoritarian presence in the selec-
     tion process and it is equally appropriate for the Senate to focus on ideology
     in the confirmation process.

        An alternative argument against the use of ideology is that it will deadlock
     the selection process--liberals will block conservatives and vice versa.
     Although there have been times in history when several nominees in a row
     have been defeated, ultimately a compromise candidate always was found.28
     Most likely, aggressive review of judicial nominees would result in more cen-
     trist judges because candidates would have to please evaluators of all view-
     points. Although both liberals and conservatives will lose some of their
     persuasion on the courts, the existence of a more moderate Court might have
     many benefits, such as stability and more widespread acceptability of the law.

       A variation of this criticism of a deadlock in the selection process is con-
    cern that attention to ideology will lead to litmus tests for nominees based on
     their views on one or two or a few specific issues. The Republican platforms
^ 1980 and 1984, for example, exhorted the President to appoint only federal
Jf judges who adhered to the pro-life position on the issue of abortion.29 How-
    ever, this objection is not a reason to reject the ideological orientation model,
    but is instead an argument against a particular way of using the model. In
    other words, if one opposes the use of litmus tests for judicial candidates,
    then one should urge use of a broader basis for assessing ideology. By anal-
    ogy, if someone using the professional qualifications model focused only on
    where nominees went to law school, the appropriate response would be to
    enlarge the basis for evaluating professional qualifications. Likewise, con-
    cern about single issue ideological tests justifies expanding the grounds for
    evaluation, not rejecting the ideological orientation model.

       Another basis for criticizing the ideological orientation model is to argue
    that it should be used only some of the time. For example, one might claim
    that it should be used in initial appointments, but not in retention election; or
    that it should be followed by the President, but not by the Senate; or that it
    should be used for Supreme Court Justices, but not for lower court judges.

    The most persuasive distinction is that the ideological orientation model
 should be used in initially reviewing a nominee for a position on a court, but
 in a retention election an individual's ideology should not be considered. M
 The argument is that a judge on a court should decide each case without an
 eye toward the coming retention election. The only way to assure such im-
 partiality is to prevent consideration of the judge's decisions in the subse-
 quent election. This argument can be used to justify how liberals could both
 oppose Robert Bork and support Rose Bird: the former was an initial ap-
 pointment, while the latter was a retention election.

    Although I recently argued in print in favor of this distinction, I am no
 longer persuaded by it.31 Treating retention elections differently makes sense
 only if one believes that ideological consideration in them will influence judi-
 cial decisions and that it is possible to exclude ideological consideration from
 the election process. The latter seems impossible. If the Bork, Bird, Grodin,
 and Reynoso rejections demonstrate anything, it is that people evaluate nom-
 inees based on ideology. In fact, so long as a judge even thinks that ideology
might matter in the subsequent election, there is the danger that a desire to
please the voters might influence decisionmaking. Inherent to judicial elec-
tions is the risk that voters will evaluate judges based on their decisions and
opinions.

   Furthermore, the concern that the election process will influence decisions
is best dealt with by abolishing or reforming that process, not by preventing
consideration of ideology. Elections are particularly poorly suited to select-
ing judges because of the difficulty voters have in informing themselves and
evaluating candidates.32 In any event, ideology is so important in determin-
ing who is desirable for a seat on the bench, that concerns for judicial inde-
pendence should be dealt with by reforming other aspects of the process and
not by prohibiting examinations of ideology.

   Alternatively, some might contend that it is permissible for the President
to look to ideology, but not permissible for the Senate to do so. This argu-
ment is unsupported by history. The framers of the Constitution definitely
intended for the Senate to play an independent and aggressive role in evaluat-
ing nominees for judicial office.33 More importantly, such Senate deference is
unjustified because the President possesses no special expertise in selecting
judges. Checks and balances are the core of the design of the federal system
and Senate confirmation is a crucial check on presidential choices.

1989]  JUDICIAL SELECTION  653

        Finally, it might be argued that the ideological orientation model should
     be used for state or federal supreme court justices, but not for lower court
    judges. The argument is that the former have substantial discretion in inter-
     preting the Constitution, making ideology particularly important. Because
     lower court judges possess less discretion, ideology should not be considered.
     However, judges at all levels possess enormous discretion. All of the cases
     ruled on at the highest level are first considered in a trial court. In fact,
     many similar cases never make their way to the Supreme Court. With so few
     cases ever reaching the Supreme Court, the decisions of the trial and appeals
     courts become rather significant. Although lower courts possess less discre-
     tion and decide more "easy cases," ideology should be considered in evalua-
     tions because there still is sufficient opportunity for ideology to manifest itself
     in decisionmaking.34

       A final objection to the ideological orientation model concerns the appro-
     priate record for determining a nominee's views. Unless the nominee has
    extensive writings documenting his or her positions on controversial issues--
    such as Robert Bork did--how is the evaluator to know the judicial candi-
    date's ideology? This issue is examined in part III.
r-- In summary, the argument for the ideological orientation model is simple:
\ people should care about the decisions likely to come from a court on impor-
  y tant issues; the ideological composition of the court will determine those de-
 ( cisions; and the appropriate place for majoritarian influences in the judicial
/ process is at the selection stage. In fact, one can wonder whether it really is
v ever possible to select judges without some attention to ideology. A rejection
    of the ideological orientation model does not necessarily mean that ideology
    can be excluded from consideration. More likely, ideology still is present in
    the evaluation, but never openly acknowledged; ideological objections get re-
    phrased as arguments against judicial skills or professional qualifications.

                           III. THE BASIS FOR IDEOLOGICAL EVALUATION

       The ideological orientation model requires attention to a judicial candi-
    date's views on issues. This raises two questions. First, how is it determined
    which issues should be examined as part of the ideological evaluation? In
    other words, just as the professional qualifications model necessitates a deter-
    mination of the criteria for evaluating qualifications and the judging skills
    model requires a measure ofjudging skills, so does the ideological orientation
    model demand an elaboration of the basis for evaluating ideology. Second,
    how should an individual's ideology be determined? Once the content for

   34. For example, the Report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Judicial Selection
recently recommended more intensive scrutiny for appointees to lower federal courts because of the
importance of these positions. See TWENTIETH CENTURY FUND REPORT, supra note 4, at 8.
     654

654  GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF LEGAL ETHICS [Vol. 2:643

 evaluation is determined, it is necessaryto decide the method for implement-
 ing the model in assessing particular candidates.

   The ideological orientation model permits consideration of an individual
 nominee's views on: 1) the appropriate method of judicial review; 2) the
appropriate content of legal doctrines likely to be decided by the judge's
court; and 3) the appropriate results in particular types of cases. First, evalu-
ation of judicial candidates should include consideration of their views on
methodological questions. For example, it is appropriate to consider
whether a nominee for a federal judicial office believes that the rights pro-
tected by the Constitution should be limited to what the framers intended or
whether it is appropriate for the court to protect rights not contemplated by
the drafters.33 Although I personally believe that any nominee who ex-
presses a strictly originalist philosophy should be rejected as unacceptable, I
recognize that the ideological orientation model licenses the rejection on non-
originalists if a majority of the Senate were committed to the opposing phi-
losophy.36 Similarly, evaluation of a person's judicial methodology should
include consideration of his or her views on the role of precedent and when it
is appropriate to overrule prior decisions.37 A Senate particularly concerned
with preserving or discarding particular decisions is likely to be very atten-
tive to the nominee's position on the role of stare decisis. In evaluating state
judges, attention might be paid to an individual's belief concerning when it is
appropriate for the court to create new common law rights rather than wait-
ing for legislative action and the individual's approach to statutory
construction.38

   A second basis for ideological evaluation is a judicial candidate's position
on particular legal doctrines. The specific doctrines to be considered will

   35. A major issue in the debate over the confirmation of Robert Bork was whether his philoso-
phy of "original intent" was a too restrictive basis for constitutional interpretation. See D. RUTKUS,

   36. There is voluminous literature debating the proper method of interpreting the Constitution.
Some of the more prominent works include: M. PERRY, THE CONSTITUTION, THE COURT AND

HUMAN RIGHTS (1982); J. ELY, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST (1980); R. BERGER, GOVERNMENT

BY JUDICIARY (1977).

   37. For a discussion of the role of precedent in constitutional interpretation, see. e.g., Maltz, The
Nature of Precedent, 66 N.C L. REV. 367 (1988) (offering a rationale for role of precedent which
permits competing societal influences to be reconciled with stare decisis); Schauer, Precedent, 39
STAN. L. REV. 571 (1987) (examining use of precedent outside the law to give new perspective on
how it should function in the law).

   38. This article has not focused at length on differences in the criteria for evaluating judges
depending on the specific court involved. However, the evaluation process should include recogni-
tion of differences,forexample, between state supreme courts and federal courts and the fact that
the former play a pivotal role in the development of state common law and in interpreting state
statutes.

 vary over time. During the 1930's, President Roosevelt rightly considered
 candidates' views on the proper scope of federal power because of his desire
 to ensure the approval of New Deal programs.39 During the 1950's and
 1960's, the Senate should have assured that federal judges would be commit-
 ted to upholding the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions.40 During the
 1980's, it is appropriate for the Senate to consider a nominee's views on top-
 ics such as whether the Constitution protects a right to reproductive privacy,
whether the individual believes the Bill of Rights should apply to the states,
and whether the equal protection clause protects women from
discrimination.

   Finally, it is appropriate to consider a judicial candidate's views on impor-
tant previously decided cases. How does the judge view Brown v. Board of
Education, Baker v. Carr, or Roe v. Wadei Certainly, an individual's posi-
tion on these precedents is revealing of his or her ideology and likely per-
formance as a judge.

   I realize, of course, that the legal doctrines or cases selected will depend
directly on the evaluator's own ideology. Although some might insist on
judges who are committed to upholding Brown, Baker and Roe, others might
believe that judges should be rejected for having those beliefs. The use of
ideology in the evaluation process is thus equally available to those who have
radically different views from one another. During the early 1980's, con-
servative Senators Jeremiah Denton and John East asked some prospective
federal judges to answer a series of questions.41 Included were questions
such as "Do you believe that the Constitution guarantees a right to privacy?
If so, please indicate the constitutional sources of thatright,its precise nature
and its limitation?" Also, there were detailed questions about the nominee's
views on abortion and questions dealing with subjects such as the death pen-
alty, the exclusionary rule, and affirmative action. All of the inquiries con-
cerned the nominee's beliefs; none asked how the individual would vote in a
specific case. Although I could not disagree more with the political and con-
stitutional values of then-Senators Denton and East, I believe that their ques-
tions were generally appropriate. Senators, whether they are liberal or
conservative, should be able to learn about judicial nominee's views and
ideology.

   Ultimately, the argument over judges becomes an argument over the de-
sired meaning of the Constitution. I regard that as good rather than bad. I

 think that the best possible celebration of the Constitution's Bicentennial was
 the Bork confirmation hearings which took place exactly 200 years after the
 Constitution was drafted in Philadelphia. For a few weeks, the nation's at-
 tention was riveted on the Constitution. Conversations were dominated by
 discussions of whether the Constitution should be limited to the framers'
 views and whether there should be a right to privacy. Such discussions are
 important in informing the public about the content of the Constitution and
 the nature of judicial decisionmaking.

    I realize that not every judicial candidate will have views on every doctrine-^
 or case. An evaluator must be sensitive to this, but realistic, as well. Does
 anyone really lack a position on Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v.
 Wadei Certainly, an individual's views on issues can change over time. The ,
evaluator, however, will have to make a judgment as to whether a claimed^
shift is genuine or whether it is a "confemjttiaiLoeBwsion," a change moti-
vated by a desire to secure appointment ancTconnrmation to the court.

   But how is the evaluator to ascertain a judicial candidate's views on key
matters? There are three primary sources of information: the candidate's
prior writingj_and speeches, the candidaicXj>nor judicial decisions, and
questions to the ca^^jale~dnrin£t^5nfirjg^^n frffTti 'P^r^y** "f

                   i use is the prior writings awi^e^let-Qtih^candidate. Such
documents reveal a person's views on judicial methodology, particular doc-
trines, and specific cases. While there are two arguments against examining a
judicial candidate's writings and speeches, neither has merit.

   First, it can be argued that people may express positions in writings or
speeches that they do not believe; that they are simply trying to be provoca-
tive. Therefore, it is unfair to use a person's writings as evidence of his or her
beliefs. This argument was made in defense of some of Robert Bork's more
extreme positions. I am very skeptical of this defense, especially when evalu-
ating an academic's writings or speeches. I do not know any law professors
who write things they do not beneve. Unlike attorneys who must advocate
the best interests of their clients, academics have the freedom to espouse their
own positions. Moreover, any time such a defense is raised, the appropriate
response is to examine the bulk of the person's writings. Does the provoca-
tive writing fit within the overall pattern of views expressed; was it expressed
OB one occasion or repeatedly? The defense of Judge Bork on this ground
was tnpenuasiv* becauae each of has controversial views was consistent with
his underlying philosophy and each had been restated frequently over a long
period of time. 41

   Sacoad, I have heard some say that allowing review of a judicial caadi-

 date's writings will serve as a disincentive to-people taking controversial posi-
 tions in print. This argument, however, ignores all of the other incentives
 that people have to espouse distinctive views. For example, given the large
 volume of legal scholarship, one way in which a person may be noticed is by
 presenting novel arguments and approaches. Also, it is hard to imagine that
 very many people will try throughout their careers to shape their writings to
 please an anonymous group of potential evaluators at some unknown, possi-
 bly never existing future time.

    In addition to examining a person's prior writings and speeches, a second
 major source of information is previous judicial decisions. If the candidate
 has prior judicial experience, much can be learned about the individual's ide-
 ology from cases already decided. Two possible objections that have been
 advanced have considerably more merit than the arguments against consider-
 ing a candidate's writings or speeches.

   One argument is that looking to a judge's past decisions threatens judicial
independence because of fear that judges will decide cases with an eye to the
evaluation that may later follow. This is a serious concern. As discussed
above, judicial independence requires that a judge decide a matter according
to his or her best views of the proper outcome. But there is at least the danger
that some judges might be influenced in their decisionmaking by the knowl-
edge that their opinions will be scrutinized when their performance is
evaluated.43

   There is no easy answer to this concern. Ultimately, a balancing choice
must be made as to whether it is more important to have the ideological
information to be gained from reading past opinions or whether it is more
essential to preserve judicial independence by preventing a judge's decisions
from being examined in any review process. Although I choose the former,
there are others who take the latter position and thus exclude consideration
of a judge's past decisions from an appraisal of his or her ideology.

   A further concern with looking to a judge's prior decisions is the need to
be sensitive to distinctions between trial courts, intermediate appellate
courts, and the highest court within a jurisdiction. Judges on trial and inter-
mediate appellate courts are obhgated to apply the law as set forth by higher
courts. Accordingly, many rulings might not be reflective of a judge's own
beliefs as to how the case should have been handled, but instead indicate the
judge's reading of the appropriate precedents.

   A final source of information about judges--and undoubtedly the most
important--is direct questions to judicial candidates from the evaluating
body. The evaluator--be it the President, a governor, the Senate, or the vot-
ers--should insist as a prerequisite to approval that the candidate answer

43. 5 K Chemerinsky, supra note 30, at 1991.
     658

658  GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF LEGAL ETHICS [Vol. 2:643

 questions about judicial methodology, about specific doctrines, and about
 particular cases.

   Throughout much of America's history, federal judicial nominees did not
appear before the Senate or the Senate Judiciary Committee.44 The first

Supreme Court nominee to personally testify before the Senate was Harlan

Fiske Stone who appeared to answer charges that an investigation conducted

by the Justice Department while he was Attorney General had been moti-
vated by political revenge.45 Even after Stone's testimony, many candidates

did not appear and those that did often set strict guidelines for Senate ques-

tioning. Felix Frankfurter, for example, informed the Senate that it would be

"improper for a nominee no less than a member of the Court to express his
personal views on any controversial political issues affecting the Court."4*

   Nominees for the Supreme Court did not begin appearing before the Sen-

ate on a regular basis until 19SS, commencing with the nomination of John
Marshall Harlan.47 The scope of questioning has varied enormously, as has

the willingness of nominees to answer inquiries. Some Justices--especially

Justices Rehnquist, Powell, Stevens, and O'Connor--were aggressively ques-

tioned while others--such as Justices White, Goldberg, and Burger--were
subjected to little scrutiny.48 Some nominees were willing to answer virtually

all questions, but others refused to answer even quite mundane questions

about their views. Judge Bork, for example, was extremely willing to discuss
his positions on countless disputed questions of constitutional law.49 In

sharp contrast, Justice Scalia refused to answer questions about any specific

Supreme Court case. Justice Scalia, for example, refused to answer a question

about Marbury v. Madison and stated that "I do not think I should answer

questions regarding any specific Supreme Court opinion, even one as funda-
mental as Marbury v. Madison."30 When Scalia was asked whether he be-

lieved in a constitutional right to privacy, he again refused to answer, stating,

"I do not think I could answer that, Senator, without violating the line I've
tried to hold."31

1989]  JUDICIAL SELECTION  659

     I contend that responses such as those of Scalia should be deemed imper-
  missible and that the Senate should refuse confirmation of anyone who re-
  fuses to answer questions about his or her judicial philosophy, specific
  doctrines, or particular past decisions. As established earlier, a judicial can-
  didate's ideology is a proper basis for evaluation and the evaluator thus needs
  to know the individual's views. Few candidates have the volume of writing
  produced by Robert Bork. The Senate (or the voters in a retention election)
  should not be precluded from an effective evaluation merely because the can-
  didate did not write articles. Nor should the process favor the appointment
  of those without a "paper trail" by only subjecting those with past writings to
  ideological scrutiny. The Senate voted against Robert Bork, in part, because
  his views on privacy were deemed unacceptable. Likewise, it should be able
  to vote against anyone with similar beliefs. It should have been able to learn
  Antonin Scalia's views before confirming his appointment to the Court.

    There are, of course, limits to the permissible questioning. Acceptable
  questioning includes asking about a person's philosophy of judging (such as,
  whether the Constitution is limited to the framers' views), asking about the
  individual's position on particular legal doctrines, and a person's views on
  specific prior decisions. I do not believe that a judicial candidate should be
 asked directly how he or she will vote on a particular issue or in a specific
 case, though often that can be inferred from permissible questions. The out-
 come of any case can depend too much on context and circumstances to
 permit such promises. Moreover, the judge's actual vote might be influenced
 by persuasion from attorneys or colleagues on the bench.
  ' I admit that the distinction between what is permissible and what is forbid-
. den under this approach is somewhat ephemeral. Is there really a difference
 between asking a person his or her views on Roe v. Wade and the right to
 privacy, as opposed to asking directly whether the individual would vote to
 overturn Roel The former questions certainly are asked with the hope of
 eliciting information about the latter. Yet, I am convinced that there is a
 difference. The former is asking a person for his or her views; the latter is
 asking for a prediction or a promise. Judicial candidates can be expected to
 have views on important legal questions, but not plans for how they will vote
 in specific instances. Even if the distinction is only in phrasing, it is prefera-
 ble that judges not be asked to make explicit promises as to their perform-
 ance once on the bench.

    The primary criticism of intense questioning about a judicial candidate's
 views is that it will create the appearance of closed-mindedness. In other
 words, to preserve the appearance ofjudicial impartiality, it is claimed that a
 prospective judge should not express any views on subjects that are likely to
 come before his or her court. The Twentieth Century Fund's Task Force on
 Judicial Selection, for example, recently issued a report stating that nominees
     660

660  GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF LEGAL ETHICS [Vol. 2:643

  for the Supreme Court should not be expected to appear as witnesses at their
  confirmation proceedings.52 Similarly, Chief Justice Rehnquist gave a speech
  criticizing the Senate's intensive questioning of Judge Robert Bork.53 Oppo-
  sition to such questioning usually results from the idea that litigants will not
 feel they have an open-minded judge if during the confirmation process the
 judge expressed views about the subject matter of the proceedings.

    This position is based on the premise that ignorance is better than knowl-
 edge. No judge is a blank slate; every judge has views on important legal
- issues before assuming the bench and those pre-existing positions influence
 decisions. Whether stated or not, these views still exist. Thus, a judicial
 candidate's refusal to answer questions does not necessarily communicate
 that the individual is uncommitted and thus is truly open-minded on the
 subject. Justice Scalia's refusal to answer questions on Marbury v. Madison
 or the right to privacy surely convinced no one that he is without views on
 these topics. In short, prohibiting questioning about ideology does not create
 even the illusion of neutrality; it only perpetuates ignorance about the indi-
 vidual's actual beliefs.34

    I strongly believe that attorneys and parties are better off knowing a
 judge's views on a subject rather than guessing or pretending that the jurist
 has no position. Information about a judge's beliefs has enormous advan-
 tages. It might facilitate settlements as parties can better assess their chances
 of prevailing at trial. It can aid strategic decisions, such as whether to take
 an appeal to a particular court. Most of all, it can improve argumentation as
 lawyers know more about the audience--the individual judges that they are
 addressing.

    Nor would a judge be disqualified from sitting on a case because he or she
 previously expressed views on the subject at issue. The Supreme Court de-
 clared in Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute that no "decision of
 this Court would require us to hold that it would be a violation of procedural
due process for a judge to sit in a case after he had expressed an opinion as to
whether certain types of conduct were prohibited by law."" Justice Rehn-
quist stated this even more strongly in his opinion explaining why he did not
recuse himself from sitting in Laird v. Tatum.56 In Laird, the Supreme
Court considered whether army surveillance of domestic groups violated the
First Amendment. Prior to his nomination and confirmation to the Court,

 Rchnquist testified on behalf of the Justice Department in favor of the consti-
 tutionality of such practices. Rehnquist wrote:

      tentative notions that would influence them in their interpretation of the
      sweeping clauses of the Constitution and their interaction with one an-
      other. It would be not merely unusual, but extraordinary, if they had not
      at least given opinions as to constitutional issues in their previous legal
      actions. Proof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court was a
      complete tabula rosa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be
      evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias.31

Assuring impartiality does not require that the judge pretend to lack views
on important topics of constitutional law.

    Moreover, prohibiting questioning of nominees about their ideology pre-
serves and encourages an anachronistic, mechanical view of judging. At a
time when there was a widespread belief in formalism, questioning of pro-
spective judges was unnecessary because the outcome was thought to depend
little on the identity of the judge. The refusal of judges to answer questions
perpetuates a notion either that the individual's ideology does not matter or
that the judge rises to the bench with far more neutrality than is humanly
possible. Institutionalization of Bork-like confirmation proceedings will
hopefully encourage the general public to adopt a more sophisticated under-
standing of the judging process.

   Thus, I believe that the Senate's questioning of Robert Bork was just and
proper and should be the norm in the future. Bork was an easy case for
application of the ideological orientation model because he had expressed his
views in so many articles and speeches. However, less prolific nominees
whose views are not known should not be immunized from such review. In
judicial elections and before confirming bodies, judicial candidates should be
required to discuss their views about the law. Rose Bird, Joseph Grodin, and
Cruz Reynoso should have been allowed (even encouraged or required) to
address the voters prior to the retention election as to their views on the
death penalty. The First Amendment embodies the philosophy that knowl-
edge is better than ignorance. The same principle should apply in the judi-
cial selection process.

entation model:

 The rule does not apply to prevent questioning of prospective judges in sys-
 tems where judicial selection is by appointment rather than election. The
 very terms of this Canon make it clear that it pertains to elections.

    However, forty-two states have some form ofjudicial elections." In these
 places, the Code of Judicial Conduct imposes a substantial barrier to judicial
candidates being able to express their views. The prohibition on expressing
 "views on disputed legal or political issues" makes questioning of judicial
candidates virtually impossible. Nor is this proscription idle rhetoric. There
are several instances where judges have been disciplined for violating this
provision.60 For instance, in In re the Matter of Honorable James C Kaiser,
a judge was censured for making statements in an election campaign that he
would be "tough on drunk driving" and for criticizing many of. the attorneys
who represent drunk drivers.61

   The easiest solution to this problem would be to amend the Code of Judi-
cial Conduct to permit judicial candidates to answer questions about their
judicial philosophy, their views about particular doctrines, and their posi-
tions on specific cases. Such an amendment would insure that no judicial
candidate would need to refrain from speech out of the fear that answers to
questions might lead to disciplinary sanctions.

   Yet, such reform by the American Bar Association (or by the individual
states adopting the Code of Judicial Conduct) may very well be unnecessary
because there is a strong argument that the ^ M M H H R I R l M g S d ^ ^

being at the very core of the First Amendment63 Speech relating to the
political process, the choosing of government officers, can be limited only if
there is a truly compelling government need and there is no less restrictive
way to accomplish the objective. The Supreme Court has explained that the
First Amendment has its "fullest and most urgent application precisely to
the conduct of campaigns for political office."64

   No compelling interest exists to justify preventing a judicial candidate
from openly discussing his or her views. As described above, the need to
preserve the appearance of judicial impartiality does not justify silencing
judges.63 The First Amendment is based on the strong assumption that peo-
ple are better off with more information in making judgments about the polit-
ical process. Censorship of speech to hide a judge's beliefs is incompatible
with this premise. Moreover, a restriction on all speech about controversial
issues is not necessary to achieve the government's purpose in prohibiting
speech. The goal of preserving impartiality can be achieved by prohibiting
individual judicial candidates from making promises of how they would de-
cide specific cases or issues.

   Second, the prohibition on speech by judicial candidates about controver-
sial issues risks serious distortion of the marketplace of ideas and informa-
tion. Judges can be falsely attacked, their positions distorted and
misconstrued, and yet, they are forbidden to respond. Falsehoods never get
countered with the truth. In California's recent retention election, for exam-
ple, there were repeated statements about the beliefs of several members of
the Court on issues such as the death penalty. To the extent that their views
were distorted, the justices could not respond. Allowing speech, even about
controversial issues, improves decisionmaking and prevents falsehoods from
going unanswered.

                                               V. CONCLUSION

   The irony of the confirmation battles over Bird, Grodin, Reynoso and
Bork was the political line-ups. Many of the same individuals who attacked
Bird, Grodin and Reynoso based on their ideology subsequently argued in
defense of Bork that his ideology was irrelevant. Conversely, many of the
same people who defended Bird, Grodin and Reynoso with pleas to focus
only on their professional qualification attacked Bork based on his ideology.

   This article has argued that the ideological evaluation was proper in both
instances. This is not to say that one need agree with the results in either or
both cases; one could defend the ideology of each of these judges. Rather,

the point is that the objection to the outcomes in these cases must be made in
substantive terms that judges with their beliefs should have been confirmed.

   Ultimately, disputes over confirmation are battles over the proper content
of the law. This is as it should be and attention should not be diverted by
claims that it is improper to consider a nominee's ideological orientation. In
fact, a process should be institutionalized to ensure a full and careful exami-
nation of each candidate's views.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Yard.

                        STATEMENT OF MOLLY YARD

  Ms. YARD. Senator Biden and members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee

  The CHAIRMAN. Would you mind pulling that microphone closer.
This hearing room is so hard to hear in, and if you do not put that
right up close

  Ms. YARD. I have never been accused of not being heard. That is
a new experience.

  The CHAIRMAN. I was not accusing you of that. I just want to
make sure I hear everything. My hearing is going. That is a joke,
by the way, so there is not an article about that. I was only kid-
ding, folks. [Laughter.]

  Fire away.
  Ms. YARD. These hearings are taking place on David Souter, be-
cause you must replace Justice Brennan. For women and all mi-
norities, all women, no matter our color, no matter our economic
circumstances, no matter our age, all Lesbians and gays, for all mi-
norities of every race, Justice Brennan stood for the highest stand-
ards on individual rights, and it is painful for us to see him go.

  I appreciate the fact that on the floor of the Senate last week,
you spoke of Justice Brennan and his contribution to this country.
I think I have never felt that I was speaking at a more solemn oc-
casion, because we are here literally on behalf of the lives of the
women of this country. It is no little matter. We have been strug-
gling for years to eradicate discrimination and to be free in this so-
ciety.

  When this Constitution was written, African-Americans were
slaves and women were the property of their husbands. We had no
rights. We did not vote, we could not serve on juries, we could not
own property, we could not be much of anything. And we had
hoped that, through the democratic process of this country, we
could step by step win our freedoms, and we have made progress.
We did finally win the right to vote. We celebrate this year the
70th anniversary of the right to vote for women in this country.

  But we have a long ways to go, and when the Supreme Court in
1973 gave us the Roe v. Wade decision edict, that Court declared
freedom for the women of this country. You have no freedom if you
can't control your life, and none of you will ever face that problem.
Not one of you. If your birth control fails, which is why most
women get abortions in this country, and you can't get an abortion
and you are forced to carry a pregnancy to term, you haven't any
freedom to plan your life, to carry out your life, to do with your life
what you dream it to become.

  You know, Justice Brennan said that the way women are treated
in this society, we think we treat them well, but he said, "The real
treatment is ending up not putting women on a pedestal but put-
ting them in a cage." And we have been in that cage, and the door
was opened in 1973. How can you contemplate letting that door
close on us again? Because we are absolutely convinced that David
Souter--and we listened very carefully. We hoped we were wrong,
but we are not wrong. He will be the fifth vote to overturn Roe v.
                                      667

Wade. And I tell you, we are not going to obey the law in this coun-
try. Women will not. There will be lawlessness everywhere. The
jails won't be big enough to hold those who break the law and the
people who help women break the law.

  We are literally--I don't know how to say it to you so that you
understand that women's lives are on the line. And if they can't
control them because abortion is illegal, they will either break the
law and/or they will die. Never, please, forget that illegal abortion
was the leading cause of death in this country, maternal death.
And it will be again. It will be again.

  I would just like to say that, you know, I sit at a desk of the larg-
est feminist organization in this country--250,000 of us--but we
speak for many more than that. Last April 1989, we brought
650,000 people here, women, men and children, to petition this
Government, Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House,
asking that Roe v. Wade not be overturned. And we understand so
well why our forebears came to this country and why people keep
coming to this country from all over the world. They come for free-
dom, for freedom from interference by Government on what they
believe in, what religion they practice, with whom they associate,
what they speak out on, and, above all, to run their lives as they
see fit.

  Would you deny women that right by allowing Roe v. Wade to be
overturned? Would you allow the discrimination against women to
go on and on, in education, in employment? In every area I get
these letters day after day after day after day about what women
suffer and the pain they go through, and yet we have a nominee
and we have no idea how he is going to treat sex discrimination.

  I wish there was some way to make every one of you understand
what is at stake here.

         My name is Molly Yard. I an President of the National
Organization for Women, the largest feminist organization in the
United States, an organization which for twenty-four years has
worked to achieve through legislation and political action full
equality for all women in this society.

         Thank you for this opportunity to state to the Senate
Judiciary Committee our concerns about the nomination of David
Souter to the Supreme Court. Your responsibility is an awesome
one, made more so on this occasion because the nomination is for
a replacement for Justice William Brennan. William Brennan stood
for justice and mercy. He stood for freedom -- for individual
rights and individual freedom. He understood why our ancestors
came to these shores -- and why people keep coming from all over
the world for the right to live their lives as they see fit, and
to be let alone without a government telling them what to believe
in politics, in religion or in anything else, and without
government telling them how to behave, with whom to associate,
and how they must live their private lives. Justice Brennan's
resignation leaves all of us who cherish individual rights
fearful, but women most of all are worried for he was a man who
understood the treatment of women in this country as, and I quote
Justice Brennans " »romantic paternalism1 which, in practical
effect, put women not on a pedestal, but in a cage."

          Because Justice Brennan holds such a unique place in
                                 670

American jurisprudence, and in our hearts, I am particularly
grateful to you, senator Blden, for your remarks last Tuesday on
the Senate floor about William Brennan. He can surely celebrate
his life but we are saddened by his resignation as the loss to
all minorities and all women is overwhelming.

         However, it is no more than empty words to laud Justice
Brennan*s principles and his extraordinary contributions on the
Court, if by your votes, you confirm a nominee who would deny
those principles and reverse those contributions.

         In these Hearings much has been made of the New England
background of David Souter. Lest you think that is somehow
unique, let me tell you that my forebears on my mother's side
sailed from England for the Massachusetts Colony in 1636 on the
good ship "the Plain Joan" for whom my daughter Joan is named.
She and I, and indeed all our family, have climbed many times
those wonderful mountains of New Hampshire so cherished by David
Souter.

         There should be no doubt in the mind of any thoughtful
citizen of the united States that our Supreme Court must play,
and has played, a critical role in protecting the lives of all of
us from arbitrary, unreasonable, or abusive legislative or
executive excess or intrusion. It has done so largely under the
Bill of Rights embodied in the first 10 amendments to our
                                  671

Constitution as well as under th* profoundly important Fourteenth
Amendment.

         MOW believes that all members of the Judiciary Committee
must appreoiate the grave responsibility which rests upon the
Committee to "advise and consent" to the appointment of a new
Justice to the United states Supreme Court. The Constitution is
clear -- Article II, Section 2 provides that the President "shall
nominateT and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
shall appoint..."Judaea of the Supreme Court...." The
appointment of a Supreme court Justice is indubitably a iaint
appointment and not, as some believe, an appointment made
unilaterally by the President, which may be rejected by the
Senate only when some gross flaw emerges to preclude
confirmation.

          It is in light of this basic constitutional requirement that
MOW wishes to make our comments concerning the pending nomination
of Judge David Souter. The known record of David Souter and what
he has said in answer to your questions to him give us serious
concern. One issue -- clearly a major concern of NOW, as is well
known -- involves the status of the landmark decision in Roe vs.
Wade where Justice Blackmun wrote the compelling opinion for a
solid majority of the Court. We were concerned before these
hearings with Judge Souter's position on the constitutional right
to abortion. Having heard his testimony, we are now concerned as
                                  672

well with Griawqld vs. Connecticut. Klaenateadt v s . Balrd and the
right to birth control, ·specially for unmarried people.

         It is not ay purpose today to engage in any discussion of
the fundamentals of constitutional law. The NOW Legal Defense
and Education Fund has prepared testimony for this Committee
which is a careful analysis of Judge Souter's record and we stand
fully behind it.

         And now I want to state as clearly as I can what this
appointment means to millions of women. And in doing so I want
to remind you that in April of 1989, 650,000 Americans -- men,
women and children -- marched and rallied in Washington in our
"March for Women's Lives/Women's Equality to petition the
government -- the Bush Administration, the Congress and the
Supreme Court --- to leave intact Roe vs. Wade and not to restrict
women's right to control their lives.

         Mario Thomas sings a wonderful song called "Free To Be Me"
and that is what this hearing is about. When the Supreme Court,
twenty-five years ago, affirmed a constitutional privacy right to
use birth control and then eight years later extended that
privacy right to include the right to choose abortion, the Court
declared freedom for women. When our forefathers wrote the
Constitution women were the property of their husbands and
African-Americans were slaves. Women could not vote, own
                                 673

property, serve on juries, or much of anything else. To declare
freedom from slavery, this country had to fight a civil war.
Women believed and hoped we could win freedom through the
political process of a democratic society. We have, step by
step, won a variety of rights and celebrate this year the
seventieth anniversary of gaining the right to vote.

         But winning the right to vote did not end our struggle for
freedom. Women have a problem which none of you will ever face -
- we get pregnant. For years women in this country freely
obtained abortions. It was not illegal to have one; indeed,
their availability was advertised in the papers by ads saying if
you had a "woman's problem" here was a place to go. I shall not
go into the history of how and why abortion became illegal but it
did so become.

         But, legal or illegal, women in every society throughout the
ages have sought and found those who perform abortions or they
have self-aborted, often with dire consequences, indeed today in
many countries of Asia, Africa and South America abortion is
illegal, but women continue to get them because they are
desperate, desperate because they already have more children than
they can afford to feed, desperate because they themselves are
ill, desperate because they do not want to bring into the world a
child they will have to abandon. (It is estimated in Brazil that
11 million children wander the streets abandoned because their
                                 674

families can't feed them.) In fact they are B O desperate they
put their lives on the line. The World Health Organisation
conservatively estimates that 200,000 women die every year from
botched, illegal abortions. As we sit here somewhere in this
world every three minutes a woman is dying from these abortions.

         When abortion became legal in our country in 1973 because of
the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, women in the United
States became free because they could now control their
reproductive lives. If one cannot decide for herself when or
whether to have children she surely has no freedom -- no freedom
to control her life, to plan her life, to decide what to do with
her life. Any goal she sets can be completely disrupted by an
unplanned pregnancy, and if she cannot end it then her life is
being controlled, not by herself but by some law enacted by men
which forces her to carry the pregnancy to term, and then be
responsible for the child borne whether or not she has the
emotional or financial resources to bear that burden.

         Not only did Roe v. Wade free women, it also vastly improved
women's health; prior to ESS, illegal abortion was the leading
cause of maternal death in this country. Abortion must be
available as a women's health measure -- the majority of women
seek abortions because birth control fails or because there is
some problem with the pregnancy. It's not a question of morality
but a question of health as well as, more profoundly, a question
                                    675

of freedom.

         For seventeen years women have had this freedom, but by your
consideration of David Souter for appointment to the Supreme
Court you are really considering ending freedom for women in this
country. He believe from Judge Souter's record that he will be
the fifth vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and furthermore he might
overturn Qriswold vs. Connecticut. This country must not go back
to illegal abortion or illegal birth control. If that happens
the law will be broken! Courageous doctors will break the law.
Desperate women will break the law. The underworld will flourish
with back alley abortion butchers and women will die. There will
not be enough jails to house the women who will have illegal
abortions and those who will help maintain that option.

         NOW is all too aware that four justices on the current Court
are prepared to overturn Roe vs. wade and on the basis of Judge
Souter's briefs and opinions we believe he would be the fifth
vote the right-wing of this country, led by President Bush and
John Sununu, has sought for the purpose of overturning Roe.
Certainly the President and his Chief of Staff have made every
attempt to assure right-wing groups like the Coalition for
America that he is one of them.

         In Coe vs. Hooker (1976) a brief signed by Attorney General
Souter, in dealing with the propriety of Medicaid funding for
                                 676

abortions,6 referred to the "killing of unborn children." As
Attorney General in 1977 judge Souter spoke out strongly in
opposition to legislation repealing New Hampshire's strict anti-
abortion laws -- which had been passed prior to Roe. Judge
Souter wrote a formal letter explaining his desire to keep the
punitive legislation in force, and in an interview with the
Manchester Union Leader on May 19, 1977 he said, "I don't think
unlimited abortions should be allowed" and "I presume we would
become the abortion mill of the United States."

        Senators, this is the language of the right-wing. They
would have you believe that women get abortions one after the
other since they use them as birth control, and that any clinic
which provides women's reproductive health services, including
abortions, is running an abortion mill. These are the words of
the right-wing which seeks to obfuscate and denigrate the health
needs of women, and employs inflammatory language to cover up a
proposition which is patently ludicrous. No woman obtains one
abortion after the other as a birth control method -- if she did
she would, during her reproductive years, have two or three a
year, fifty or sixty during her life, NO woman does that!

        And why in Smith vs. Cote did Judge Souter go out of his way
to worry about a doctor, whom the court found guilty of
malpractice, because he did not counsel a pregnant woman exposed
to rubella that she should be tested for risks to her fetus and
                               677

if problems were found she had the constitutional right to an
abortion? Why did the Judge express concern about the doctor
counseling his patient in this natter because the doctor might
have "conscientious scruples against abortion?" This question
was not part of the case. It was not raised in the lower court
decision nor on appeal, and was gratuitously injected by Judge
Souter. He seems overly anxious to place himself on the side of
the opponents of abortion and, in fact, twice, in his answers to
your questions, he described women seeking abortions as "the
other side."

         Senator Metzenbaum tried to discover whether he had empathy
with a woman who found herself pregnant with an unplanned
pregnancy. After a long pause Souter said he wasn't prepared for
the question, no doubt because the Bush legal experts who coached
him for this Hearing never themselves would have thought of that
question because they have no empathy for anyone in that
situation. Whatever the reason. Judge Souter finally answered by
remembering the case of a girlfriend of a Harvard student who was
pregnant and planning to self-abort. The student was worried
about her and wanted Souter to talk to her and Souter did. This
shows empathy? How do we know but what he may have cold bloodily
told her she would be a murderer if she ended her pregnancy?
What we do know from his answer,vas that he counselled her not to
self-abort.
                                 678

         On the issue of birth control, Judge Souter was careful in
his testimony always to describe the right to privacy as a
marital right. Even in the case of married couples right to
contraception, he carefully did not endorse the decision in
Griswold vs. Connecticut and did not ever state that the right of
married people to contraception is a fundamental right.

         On the right of unmarried people to birth control. Judge
Souter was even less supportive in his testimony, stating only
his agreement with the court's equal protection approach to the
analysis in Eisenstadt. once Griswold had been decided.

         It surely would be interesting to know whether Judge
Souter's view of Roe vs. Wade and of Griswold vs. Connecticut was
explored by, or on behalf of, the White House staff before his
nomination was announced. Frankly we do not find credible that
it was not; nor do we find credible that Judge Souter, portrayed
as an intellect and scholar, could have no opinion on Roe vs.
Wadg.

         Professor Alan Dershowitz reminds us that "...Judge souter
was nominated, in effect by John Sununu, a strident opponent of a
woman's right to choose, of separation of church and state and of
equal rights under the law. If Mr. Sununu believes that Judge
Souter will wake a great justice ... then the rest of us have
something to worry about."
                                 679

         Apart from this, we have major concerns as to Judge Souter's
views concerning the relevance and potential weight of precedent
in the Court's interpretation of the Constitution. His general
views as to the basic protections springing from the Bill of
Rights -- including racial and sexual discrimination, separation
of church and state and the right of privacy -- put all Americans
at risk. We are, furthermore, very concerned about his standard
of scrutiny on gender discrimination under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

         It seems to us after listening to Judge souter's responses,
that he has an apparent lack of appreciation of, and deference
to, the unique nature of the responsibility and authority of the
Supreme court as the only body charged not only to uphold, but
also to interpret the Constitution.

         For example. Judge Souter emphasizes that Supreme Court
Justices are not the only ones to take an oath to uphold the
Constitution. He stressed the shared nature of this
responsibility, and reminded the Committee that they, as well as
the President, had taken the oath. Especially in the absence of
a substantial body of scholarly or judicial writing from which
may be gleaned a more refined view of Judge Souter's
understanding of the scope of judicial, executive and legislative
responsibilities as to our constitutional rights, our concern is
that he is neither willing nor prepared to embrace the
                                 680

responsibility which the Committee is considering entrusting to
hi*.

         On all such natters there is one obvious basic concern which
this Committee must address: Does Judge Souter's total
background of experience suffice to qualify him for the enormous
responsibility whioh the next Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court
inevitably aust face?

         As the members of this Committee well know there may be
thousands of state and federal judges in the United States who
have the basic qualifications and are available to fill this
particular vacancy on the Supreme Court; persons eminently
qualified to interpret and apply the deliberately broad language
in many provisions of the U.S. Constitution.

         Presumably the President's advisers, and certainly the
Department of Justice, were in a position to suggest a number of
such Judges for consideration by the President.

         So we ask -- Why Judge David Souter?

         What was the basic purpose in advancing this nomination of a
man with no substantial discernible record?

         Perhaps the White House Btaff knows more about the nominee
                                    681

than do the rest of us -- including this committee.

         Judge Souter's assurances last week that he would approach
all sensitive issues with an "open mind" is not enough.

         It has been reported that Judge Souter greatly admires the
works of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. No doubt some members of
this Committee share this admiration. It thus seems pertinent to
recall the immortal words of Justice Holmes in his dissertation
on the Common Law ·--

                   "The life of the law has not been logic: it
                   has been experience.*

         Those words were addressed, of course, to the development of
the common law over many years. But Justice Holmes also wrote
these words, which indubitably apply more generally --

                   "Every important principle which is developed
                   by litigation is in fact and at bottom the
                   result of more or less definitely understood
                   views of public policy; most generally, to be
                   sure, under our practice and tradition, the
                   unconscious result of instinctive preferences
                   and inarticulate convictions, but none the
                   less traceable to views of public policy in
                                  682

                  the last analysis." (The Common Law." 1963
                  Ed-Harvard Un. Press, p. 32)

         He call your attention to two polls on the subject of
abortion which relate to these Hearings;

         1. Every year since 1973 Lou Harris has polled the voters of
         this country as to whether they support Roe vs. Wade. Each
         year a majority has supported it, generally at S3 or 54%.
         In 1989 this shot up to 64% support. In 1990 the support
         stands at 73%.

         2. Planned Parenthood commissioned William Hamilton to poll
         1000 registered voters between August 30 and September 4
         regarding the Souter nomination. By 76% to 20% voters
         wanted the U.S. Senate to pose questions to Souter on his
         personal views on privacy, church-state relations, abortion
         and civil liberties. By 49% to 23% these voters said his
         responses should be a major factor in his confirmation. 47%
         said if he refused to answer this should be the deciding
         factor in whether to confirm.

         In summary we repeat our opposition to the confirmation of
Judge Souter. It is important that the Court maintain a balance.
To replace Justice Brennan it is important to have someone more
in his mold; Judge Souter will tip the court dangerously out of
balance and away from the strong support for individual rights
                                683

which Brennan B O brilliantly upheld.
         What is at stake for American woven is far too important for

us to do anything but urge you not to confirm him. American
women's lives are literally on the line. If we should lose the
right to control our reproductive lives the social fabric of our
society will be torn apart.

         Are you prepared to deny freedom to women?
         Are you prepared to deny reproductive health to women?
         Are you prepared for lawlessness, and for the death of your
daughters and your granddaughters?
         I tremble for this country if you confirm David Souter. But
most of all I tremble for the women of America and their
families.

  The CHAIRMAN. I think you did a very compelling job doing just
that.

  Ms. Smeal.

                 STATEMENT OF ELEANOR CURTI SMEAL
  Ms. SMEAL. I am Eleanor Smeal. I am the president of the Fund
for the Feminist Majority, and I am also the chair of NOW's advi-
sory committee.
  For the past 25 years or 20 years, I personally have worked on
women's rights. I have toured this country, and I would like to
speak from my heart. And so I am submitting formally my testimo-
ny representing my organization and the research of a professional
staff, and also the able assistance of Prof. Erwin Chemerinsky, pro-
fessor of law at the University of Southern California at Los Ange-
les. It goes through many points of law that were discussed here.
But I would
  The CHAIRMAN. Your entire statement will be placed in the
record.
  Ms. SMEAL. I would like to submit for the record my entire state-
ment which goes through the right to privacy for women, for gays
and lesbians; it goes through the rape shield laws; it goes through
the whole affirmative action and the middle tier scrutiny; and it
goes through essentially original intent, and all this as to how it
impacts sex discrimination in this country.
  But I also would like to speak from the heart because I believe
that it is impossible in 5 minutes to summarize what we believe
will happen if the fifth vote goes on this Court, not only against a
woman's right to choose, for abortion, but also for birth control, but
also another vote to make it ever so hard to fight discrimination in
this country.
  We have examined everything of Mr. Souter, and there is not
one shred of evidence to show that he would maintain the current
status, let alone not go backwards. In fact, every act as attorney
general and every decision as a judge that had to deal with dis-
crimination on race or sex helped to push us backward. And if it
was the national standard, God help us all.
  It would be a pity to add such a vote, but to add such a decisive
vote is, indeed, a tragedy. I hear a lot about him being warm and
understanding and he will listen. Warm and understanding. Yet
when he was asked by you all, not once but several times, what
would happen if Roe was reversed, he gave a legalistic argument.
He talked about the political consequences that we would have dif-
ferent laws in different legislatures. He talked about the complica-
tions to federalism. To federalism?
  When he was asked again, he alluded sneakily to this 1-, 2-hour
session some 24 years ago. But, again, he couldn't say what would
happen to women. The word "women" did not cross his lips when
asked what would happen.
  I have a bracelet. The bracelet has the name of Becky Bell on it.
Two years ago this past Sunday, she died trying to get an illegal
abortion. She was the victim of the parental consent law of the
State of Indiana. We don't have to imagine what is going to
happen, Senators. We know what is going to happen. Becky died
                                      685

needlessly because politicians will not stand up and not give
women a chance to choose. She was 17 years of age. We don't have
to dream what she would look like. We can see her picture. She
would be in college today.

  That was with the current Court. One more vote, and there will
be many more Becky Bells, many more Rosie Jimenezes. We have
a bracelet for her. She was the first victim of the Hyde amend-
ment.

  In fact, we have a monument already for the courageous women
who will die because they had no choice. Right now as I stand here,
as we have all talked, women have died from illegal abortion.
Worldwide, one woman dies every 3 minutes from an illegal abor-
tion where abortion is illegal. That is the ones who die. The ones
who are maimed, the ones who are injured, the ones who can never
live a normal life again, are too countless to name.

  Are we going to join the reactionary regimes of Romania? Oh, we
all criticize Ceausescu today. But our American Government fa-
vored his policies that led to the slaughter of women with the high-
est death rates from illegal abortion.

  What is wrong with us? Are we going to go back to an uncivilized
day? And do not put us in the box of being single-issue people.
Molly and myself and the other women here have marched not
only for women. We have marched for minorities. We have
marched for gays and lesbians. We have marched for the lesser and
the most, for dignity and the rights of people.

  That literacy test that you spoke of, Senator Kennedy--and I am
so glad that you were appalled by it. I knew you would be. You
always stand for justice. If Judge Souter had come from a Southern
State, having that position on a literacy test, he wouldn't be consid-
ered a moment. You know and I know what literacy tests meant.
We know what bias testing is. That he would defend it today and
say that New Hampshire has no discrimination just shows that he
is insensitive to what discrimination is because such tests are in-
herently biased, inherently discriminatory. And, yes, women know
about such tests. We are challenging tests that are discriminatory
all over this Nation right now because we are kept out of scholar-
ship programs and educational programs, and we defend them not
only on the basis of sex discrimination but race discrimination.

  Yes, we are upset. We feel inadequate. We have pictures, and we
have bracelets. But, more important, we have a heart that has
walked those streets for 20 years, 25, my colleague to my left for 40
years. And if he is confirmed, it all goes to shreds.

  I hope you can live with your conscience because the burden is
on you, and we will not forget. We will hold you accountable to the
best of our ability.

  [The prepared statement of Ms. Smeal follows:]
                                    686

                              Testimony of Eleanor Cutri Smeal
                  President, The Fund for the Feminist Majority
                   Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary
          on the Nomination of David Souter for the Supreme Court

       I am Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority. The Fund for the Feminist Majority is a national
non-profit research, action and advocacy association, dedicated to
empowering women and eliminating discrimination. We are the first
group to form based on the reality that current public opinion
polls demonstrate that a majority of Americans self-identify as
feminists (people who advocate women's equality) or supporters of
the women's rights movement.

       It is ironic and a testimony to the need of groups such as the
Fund for the Feminist Majority that seek to empower women, that I
must come before this all male Judiciary Committee begging once
more for the fundamental rights of women. I express strong and
unequivocal opposition to the confirmation of David Souter for a
position as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme
Court.

      My testimony has been prepared after exhaustive research of our
professional staff and with the expert assistance of Erwin
Chemerinsky, Professor of Law at the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles. We have carefully reviewed and
investigated David Souter's record in New Hampshire; as Deputy
Attorney General, Attorney General, and as a Justice on the New
Hampshire Supreme Court. There is nothing -- not a shred of
evidence -- that indicates any willingness to uphold or advance
civil rights for women and minorities. In fact, every brief,
every opinion, takes a repressive and regressive approach to
constitutional protections for women and minorities.

                                            1
                                     687

      Thus, the burden was on David Souter to show during these
hearings that the picture which emerges from his prior work is
inaccurate; that he is committed to civil rights'for women and
minorities. But his testimony -- and I have listened carefully to
his testimony -- contains little more than platitudes/
unacceptable non-answers, and troubling replies when it comes
to these issues. There is nothing but blind faith to justify
believing that he will uphold basic constitutional freedoms. And
blind faith is not enough. A judicial nominee must not be
confirmed without substantial evidence that he or she will protect
fundamental constitutional guarantees. No such evidence exists
for David Souter.

      Although I believe that David Souter poses a threat to
constitutional rights in many areas, my testimony will focus on
women's rights. At the outset, it is important to emphasize that
the rights of more than half of the population must not be
dismissed as merely the concerns of a special interest group. I
hope that every member of this Committee -- Democrat and
Republican, liberal and conservative -- agrees that an individual
who does not understand women's rights or has no opinions about
women's fundamental liberties under the Constitution has no place
on the United States Supreme Court. A person should not be
confirmed for the Supreme Court unless he or she evidences
commitment to certain basic constitutional values; reproductive
privacy and gender equality must be among them. Because David
Souter's record and testimony offer no reason to believe he is
committed to these values, and every reason to fear that he is
                                  688

opposed to them, I respectfully urge you to refuse to confirm him
for a seat on this nation's highest court.

      In general, it must be noted that David Souter's approach to
constitutional interpretation poses a real risk for real women.
Souter has termed himself an "interpretivist" before this
Committee. Traditionally, that has meant a judicial philosophy
that limits the Constitution's protections to what the framers
intended. Indeed, as a New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice, David
Souter wrote a dissenting opinion upholding filing fees in probate
cases on the grounds that they were not inconsistent with the
framers1 intent in drafting the state constitution. Estate of
Dinnne. 518 A.2d 178 (N.H. 1976).

      But adherence to this theory of constitutional interpretation
poses a grave threat to women. Women were viewed as chattel with
no rights when the Constitution was drafted. And the framers of
the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to eliminate gender
discrimination. Robert Bork was properly rejected for a seat on
the Supreme Court because of his commitment to this unacceptable
method of constitutional interpretation. David Souter, however,
said that he is not wedded to "original intent," but instead he
would follow "original meaning" or "original understanding." How
is this more than a mere word game to make his views seem more
palatable? The original meaning of the Constitution with its
blatant sexist and racist provisions was disastrous to women,
blacks, and unlanded men.

      A review of David Souter's record and testimony on the issues
of reproductive privacy and gender discrimination reveals that he

                                            3
                                 689

is very much the interpretivist he proclaims to be: he finds
little, if any, protection for women in the Constitution. His
past record on these two crucial issues raises profound concerns
and his testimony, if anything, heightens these concerns about
what David Souter would be like as a Supreme Court Justice.

      An analysis of his record on the issue of privacy must begin
with a brief filed by his office, when he was Attorney General,
which called abortion the "killing of unborn children."
(Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Suspension of
Injunction Pending Appeal in C O B V . Hookerr at 5 ) . The state of
New Hampshire could have opposed public funding of abortion
without describing abortion in this inflammatory manner. As a
public official sworn to uphold the Constitution -- the Supreme
Court already had interpreted the Constitution to protect a right
to abortion -- Attorney General Souter should not have allowed the
State to describe abortion in that manner to a federal court.

      Attorney General Souter's own statements indicate that the
brief likely reflected his strong anti-abortion sentiments. In
1977, he opposed repeal of New Hampshire's strict criminal
anti-abortion law. The law had been rendered a virtual nullity by
Roe v. Wade and served no real purpose. Nonetheless, Souter
opposed its repeal arguing that without it the state would become
an "abortion mill." (Manchester Onion T.*>arierr May 19, 1977 quoted
in Manchester Union Leader. August 4, 1990, p. 1). His position
and his language indicate a person opposed to constitutional
protection for abortion rights.

      Nor does his testimony before this Committee offer the
                                   690

slightest reason to believe that he would protect constitutional
privacy if confirmed for the Supreme Court. Initially, women's
rights advocates were concerned about the constitutional
protection of the right to abortion; after hearing Judge Souter's
testimony we believe that the constitutional protection of the
right to birth control for both married and unmarried individuals
is also in jeopardy.

      In response to repeated questioning, the most David Souter
would say is that he believes that the Constitution protects
certain aspects of marital privacy, but he was vague as to which
specific aspects are protected. Although he was willing to
express general support forflriswoldv. Connecticut's protections
of marital privacy, he refused to endorse its holding or its
opinion. Indeed, when asked by Senator Leahy if he considered
marital privacy a matter of settled law, he said that "one simply
could not say that it is settled."

      Most startling, Judge Souter has refused to answer any
questions on the Eiaenstadt. decision which gave single people the
right to birth control. When asked by Senator Biden about the
guaranteed right of privacy for unmarried couples, Souter stated
that privacy rights for unmarried individuals are "not a simple
question to answer," and in fact proceeded to say that there is a
State interest in precluding people "under those circumstances
from obtaining contraceptive information and devices" that should
be weighed against this privacy right. What sort of compelling
State interest could there be in blocking access to birth control
information and contraceptives?

                                            5
                                     691

      Millions of Americans use birth control and contraceptive
devices. They would be shocked to learn that a nominee for the
United States Supreme Court does not consider this right as a
settled point of law. Millions of women depend on access to
abortion and birth control for their very health and well-being.

      In his testimony before this Committee, David Souter gave women
little reassurance. He stated that he agreed with the late
Justice John Harlan on determining when to regard a right as
fundamental; that "inquiry into the history and traditions of the
American people as being the basis upon which a fundamental
valuation should rest."

      Repeatedly, Judge Souter has described his judicial philosophy
on due process questions as identical to that of Justice
Harlan. Yet, a reading of Justice·Harlan's opinions reveals that
he likely would not have protected a constitutional right for
unmarrieds to engage in sexual relations or to purchase and use
contraceptives. In Griswold v. Connecticut. 381 U.S. 479 (1965).
Justice Harlan quoted his earlier opinion in Poe v. nilmanr 367
U.S. 497 (1961), that the content of due process is determined by
history. Although Justice Harlan spoke of the tradition of
protecting marital privacy, he expressly recognized the ability of
the government to criminally punish "adultery, homosexuality,
fornication, and incest." Justice Harlan explained that
"Adultery, homosexuality, and the like are sexual intimacies which
the State forbids altogether, but the intimacy of husband and wife
in necessarily as essential and accepted feature of the
institution of marriage an institution which the State not only
                                    692

must allow, but which it always has fostered and protected."
       In other words, Justice Harlan -- and therefore apparently

David Souter -- would deny constitutional protection for unmarried
sexual activity, including the use of contraceptives. This
position is unthinkable in a civilized society. Indeed, it
reflected the profound difficulties in limiting the Constitution,
an organic evolving document, only to that which has been
protected historically.

      We have been told that we should be comforted by the fact that
David Souter permitted abortions to be performed at Concord
Hospital while he served on its Board of Directors. But in
reality, very few abortions are performed there, and women are
routinely referred away from Concord Hospital. New Hampshire has
five hospitals which perform abortions, yet overall, they perform
only 5% of abortions in New Hampshire. In most states, hospitals
provide 10% of all abortions. If anything, New Hampshire
hospitals perform half the level of abortions of other states.

      And we are also supposed to gain solace from Mr. Souter's
dramatic recollection of counseling a pregnant women for two hours
24 years ago. But he refused to tell us how he counseled her
other than away from her original direction, and refused to reveal
how he would respond to the same situation today. Such a
"confirmation recollection" does not reassure us that our rights
are safe or that he would listen.

      And Mr. Souter's warm, compassionate, confirmation image melted
away in yesterday's hearings, when Senator Leahy asked the pointed
question, "What would be the practical consequences, not the

                                        7
                                    693

legal, of overturning Rns v. Wade -- the practical consequences?"
Mr. Souter coldly replied that ."There would be the obvious
practical immediate political consequences that the issue would
become a matter for legislative judgment in every state. It is
safe to say that legislative judgment would not be uniform. There
would be, I dare say, a considerable variety in the scope of
protection afforded or not afforded. The issue of federalism
would be a complicated issue."

          Mr. Souter did not answer, as he had been asked, in terms of
the impact on real people. Instead, he focused on the political
consequences. There was no sign of Souter feeling any compassion
or understanding for the devastating and lethal impact that
overturning Roe v. Wade would have on women. Mr. Souter saw it as
a cold, detached, and theoretical discussion rather than one of
grave human suffering and misery, and one where we know for sure
that women will die.

      Over and again, David Souter refused to answer your questions
about abortion and reproductive privacy. Of course, members of
the Committee did not ask him how he would vote if confirmed for
the Court; you wanted to know his views on the subject as of now.
But he refused to offer the slightest indication of whether he
supports this constitutional right. You were not asking him about
an unresolved, speculative future issue; you were asking him about
a constitutional right that was established almost two decades
ago.

      He said that he could not discuss the matter because the
Supreme Court might be asked to overrule Roe v. Wade. This answer

                                        8

      39-454--91 23
                                    694

seems disingenuous in light of his willingness to discuss other
matters, such as affirmative action and criminal procedure, that
will come before the Court. Furthermore, the fact that the Court
might rule on abortion questions does not excuse him from sharing
his beliefs as of now. The people know how other members of the
Court likely view the abortion question; there is no reason that
they must guess as to how David Souter feels. He would no more be
disqualified from sitting on an abortion case than any other
Justice who has views that have been expressed. If David Souter
has beliefs, there is no point pretending that he does not. And
if David Souter truly has no views on abortion and Roe v. Warief
then he is probably the only lawyer, judge, or adult in America
without such an opinion.

      Under other circumstances, -the failure to answer question might
not be fatal to a nomination. But here, where David Souter's
record shows hostility to reproductive rights for women, it is
incumbent on him to show his willingness to uphold these basic
constitutional freedoms. And it is incumbent upon this body to
determine beyond a reasonable doubt that he will uphold these
freedoms. His silence does not create the impression of
open-mindedness, but of likely antipathy to abortion rights in
light of his earlier positions and the lack of any other evidence.

      Reproductive freedoms are not simply one more right among many.
They are basic civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and
essential to the life and health of women. Studies show that
forty-six percent of all women will have an abortion. The vast
majority of adults will use contraceptives. Without

                                        9
                                    695

constitutional protection, women will die and suffer from illegal
abortions and unwanted pregnancies. At this point in
constitutional history, reproductive freedoms hang by a thread and
there is every indication that David Souter will'cut that thread.

      A person is unsuitable for the Supreme Court unless he or she
expresses a commitment to basic constitutional freedoms.
Reproductive privacy is one of these guarantees. Moreover,
throughout history, the Senate has considered the likely effect of
a nominee at the time of confirmation. The simple reality is that
the next Justice could decide the future of abortion rights and
reproductive freedom. There is nothing in David Souter's record
or testimony -- not a scrap of information -- to justify believing
that he would safeguard these basic liberties. On this ground
alone, I urge the Senate to reject him and to protect American
women.

      David Souter's unduly restrictive view of constitutional
privacy is reflected in his ruling that New Hampshire
constitutionally could prevent homosexuals from adopting children
or providing foster care. Opinion of the Justicesr 525 A.2d 1095
 (1987). The New Hampshire House of Representatives requested an
advisory opinion from the State Supreme Court on the
constitutionality of a state law that would have restricted the
ability of homosexuals to adopt or care for children. Justice
Souter joined the Court's majority opinion in holding that the
proposed law would not deny equal protection by preventing
homosexuals from adopting children or being foster parents.
Despite copious evidence to the contrary, the Court found that the

                                        10
                                 696

state had a legitimate interest in providing heterosexual role
models for children. This decision reflects a very narrow
conception of constitutional privacy and a view of gays and
lesbians based on homophobic stereotypes, not facts.

       In addition, David Souter's position on gender discrimination
makes him unsuitable for the nation's highest Court. As Attorney
General, David Souter filed a brief in the United States Supreme
Court urging the Court to abandon the use of intermediate scrutiny
for sex-based classifications. The petition for a writ of
certiorari argued that intermediate scrutiny created a "twilight
zone" that "lacks definition, shape, or precise limits."
(Petition for Writ of Certiorari, in Helgemne v. Melnon, 1978, at
18-19).

      Nothing in the nature of this case required Attorney General
Souter to argue for lessening the standard for constitutional
protection for women. He could have defended that state's
statutory rape laws under intermediate scrutiny. In fact, the
Supreme Court later upheld such statutes under intermediate
scrutiny. S P P Michael M. v. Sonoma Countyr 450 U.S. 464 (1981).
As a public officer sworn to uphold the Constitution, there is no
reason why he should have been arguing that the Supreme Court
should overrule its precedents protecting women.

       In his testimony before this Committee, Souter was given the
opportunity to express a commitment to prohibiting and remedying
gender discrimination. Surprisingly, his response to questions
centered on criticizing intermediate scrutiny in terms almost
identical to those used in the certiorari petition filed by the

                                                 1 1
                                   697

Attorney General's office. Although he indicated that he favored
using more than rational basis review for gender discrimination,
he did not provide any indication of how he would apply the equal
protection clause or of a willingness to protect women from
discrimination.

       Indeed, nothing in his record indicates the slightest
sensitivity to issues of gender or race discrimination. As a
Justice on the New Hampshire Supreme Court he authored an opinion
declaring unconstitutional the application the application of the
State's rape shield law. Violence against women is tragically
widespread in this society. One in three women will be raped in
her lifetime. According to the 1989 Uniform Crime Report and the
National Crime Survey, every hour 16 women confront rapists, and
every six minutes a women is raped -- close to one million women
annually. Yet Mr. Souter referred to this pervasive violence
against women as an "undignified predicament." His description of
the situation of women who are raped reveals an underlying lack of
compassion, understanding and empathy. Would he view male victims
of life-threatening assaults with such contempt and insensitivity?

      Over the past decade, the rape rate has risen four times as
fast as the total crime rate, and 60 - 80% are date or
acquaintance rapes; of those only 3% are prosecuted. Many states
have adopted rape shield laws to encourage women to report sexual
assaults by preventing questioning about their sexual history.
New Hampshire's law prohibited .testimony of "prior consensual
sexual activity between the victim and any person other than" the
defendant. State v. r.olbat-.hf 540 A.2d 1212 (N.H. 1988). Such

                                            12
                                    698

laws reflect the fact that a woman's behavior with others is
totally irrelevant to the defendant's guilt.

      Virtually no court ever has held it unconstitutional to apply a
rape shield law. But Judge Souter, writing for the New Hampshire
Supreme Court, found that it was unconstitutional to exclude
evidence of a rape victim's allegedly "sexually suggestive"
behavior toward several men at a bar. But dress and flirtatious
conduct are not an invitation to rape. Judge Souter's opinion
reflected tremendous insensitivity to women and the problem of
sexual assault.

      Likewise, his statement before this Committee that it is a
"mathematical" fact that literacy tests "dilute" the votes of
other citizens reflects his attitude toward civil rights. The
statement once again shows an insensitivity which is inappropriate
for a Justice on the United States Supreme Court. If Souter was
from a Southern state and defended literacy tests, he would not
even be considered in the running for a seat on the Supreme Court.
His defense, to this very day, that this literacy test as used in
New Hampshire was not discriminatory shows that he does not
understand how such tests are fundamentally and inherently
discriminatory. There is no way such testing can be used without
discriminating. This is not only relevant to the civil rights of
minorities, but also the rights of women.

      For years I have worked to eliminate discriminatory tests which
are used to deny women and minorities educational and employment
opportunities; to think that the United States Senate would
approve someone who defends the most elementary of discriminatory

                                            13
                                  699

tests, one used to bar one of the most fundamental rights of
citizenship -- voting -- is chilling indeed. How can we expect
him to comprehend the devastating, yet more subtle, sex-biased and
race-biased standardized testing commonly used in employment and
education?

      And Mr. Souter's activities against the peaceful
environmentalists at Seabrook are especially frightening to women,
who because we have not been included in political deo-ision-making
in this nation, are frequently forced to protest and petition the
government for redress of grievances. Mr. Souter's Draconian
methods to repress free speech and assembly, his use of the power
of the government to prevent dissent, and his request for
preventive detention of demonstrators are grave warnings of his
willingness to gut the First Amendment.

      Although the cases I have discussed are familiar to the -members
of this Committee, I reviewed them because the cumulative picture
is deeply troubling. They show not a person who is a blank slate,
but one where all the evidence points in one direction. It shows
not a person who is warm and compassionate but an individual who
does not understand or care about the real needs and rights of
people. I ask members of this Committee, can you point to any
evidence -- any speech, any article, any brief, any opinion --
where David Souter expressed a commitment to reproductive privacy
or civil rights for women?

       The rights and lives of millions of women -- and particularly
young women -- rest on this nomination. The confirmation or
rejection of David Souter will probably have more effect on their
rights than all of the laws you will pass in all of your days in
the United States Senate.

       Please, I urge you, do not place women's rights and women's
 lives in jeopardy. David Souter is far too great a risk to civil
rights, liberties and lives to have a place on the Supreme Court.
                                              700

   The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank you all for your testimony.
   Let me begin with you, Ms. Smeal. Tell me what it is that has
made you absolutely certain that Judge Souter, if Justice Souter
would overrule Roe v. Wade?
   Ms. SMEAL. I am glad you asked the question.
   The CHAIRMAN. SO am I, it is better than being
   Ms. SMEAL. I have had the experience of testifying before for Jus-
tices and I have been able to call them pretty accurately. We were
one of the few women's organizations that stood up against Associ-
ate Justice Anthony Kennedy. We were not fooled. We looked at
his record. We examined it in detail.
   We have examined Mr. Souter's record in detail. He has never
once ruled or said anything that would indicate that he is for pri-
vacy rights. Before, when he had a chance, as attorney general or
judge, in fact, he has written with the language of our opponents.
   As I stood here, as I say back here and I also watched on televi-
sion and I have read and I have heard every word, he has indicated
he is on the other side. He has even talked to us and referred to us
as "the other side." Check his testimony.
   When he talks about the rights of privacy, he talks about certain
marital privacy acts being there, but he never says which ones,
never specifies it clearly. You, Senator Biden, summarize him more
generously than he is, in fact, saying, because he holds back. He
will not affirm or endorse the decisions or opinions of Griswold. He
will not speak to Eisenstadt. In fact, he aligns himself with the de-
cision of Harlan, the concurring decision of Harlan, and if you read
Harlan's decision carefully, under him Harlan would not go along
with privacy rights for unmarried people. He talks about the tradi-
tion of the history of our country being against fornication, homo-
sexuality, and against, in fact, rights for unmarried people.

   It does not surprise me that he will not talk about Eisenstadt,
because it would not be very popular to say that you would be
against the rights of unmarried people for birth control in this
country. He will not go down that road you wanted him to go very
far at all. He will not even go as far as Kennedy, in my opinion.

  There is no question, he is the fifth vote, because his own words,
he says it is not settled law. He talks about it as if it will be called
into question successfully. What does that mean, "successfully"? To
me, successful would be that it would be reaffirmed; to him, the
challenge would be successful.

  When you are putting a fifth vote on and he is talking about
original intent, original meaning, original understanding, all this
jargon, but always around the question, what proof has he given to
us that he would not be that vote? Everything has indicated that
he will be that vote.

  The CHAIRMAN. If he had indicated--and this is a question to all
of you--if he had indicated that he believed there was a right to
privacy of a woman to determine whether or not to terminate a
pregnancy, would that have been sufficient for any of you? If not,
would you have been required to know, as well, what balancing
test he would apply, with specificity, in order to get your support?

   Do you understand the question? I know you understand the
question, but I am parsing it in two parts here. Would privacy at
present be sufficient, or would you require, in order to give support
                                      701

for any nominee that will come forward--and if this nominee does
not succeed, there will be someone else--would you require that
nominee to specifically state how they would rule on Roe v. Wade,
not just on the principles, but specifically state "I will support Roe
v. Wade, if in fact put on the Court?

  I guess I should start with you, Ms. Smeal, and then work my
way down.

  Ms. SMEAL. We believe that he should say that he is for the fun-
damental right to privacy and that this is, in fact, settled law,
that--let us put it this way, the word game should stop, he should
be saying where he is. You know, we are saying a lot about, well,
you cannot ask this question or that question. That would say that
the current judges would have to disqualify. They have said where
they stood. We know where they are going to stand. It does not say
the way they are going to rule on a particular case, but at least
you would know where the man stands. He must be the only
person in the United States without an opinion.

  Think about it. And he sat here and said he has not discussed it,
when he has had esteemed colleagues say he has talked hours to
them about politics and about the major issues of our day. Well,
certainly this is one of them. I think we have a right to know and
you have a right to know when you are casting your vote, and he
has not been forthcoming.

  If this is the standard that you are going to accept, you are going
to get a lot of vague questions from now on anything that is impor-
tant, and we are going to get people who will just say warm, fuzzy
things. A 2-hour discussion 24 years ago, in which he will not even
say where he stood then, let alone where he stands now, is simply
no standard at all.

  I do want to again say that if we are to gain confidence on him
on Harlan, I think American women and men must know that
draws into question, not only his position on Roe, but his position
on whether or not a woman can get a birth control prescription
without the consent of her parents or the consent of her spouse or,
if she happens to be in a certain State, or if she is single or mar-
ried. He is rendering, if he does that kind of stuff and if we go
down that road, the social fabric of this country. You cannot put it
back together again.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Yard.
  Ms. YARD. Well, I think if he said very, very clearly that he be-
lieved there is an absolute fundamental right under the privacy in-
terpretation for a woman to decide when and whether to have a
child, that is what you need to know.
  I do not know that you need a specific answer on Roe v. Wade. I
think to say that there is an absolute fundamental right to control
your reproductive life is what we want to know.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. ALLRED. Mr. Chairman, I would like to refer to something
that I would be very happy to also put into the record, which is a
very excellent article from the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics,
"Ideology, Judicial Selection and Judicial Ethics," by Erwin Che-
merinsky, and basically refers to the question of what questions a
judicial nominee can be asked.
                                                702

  Summarizing it, basically, we do walk a fine line. I would not ask
him, perhaps, how he would rule, to promise how he would rule on
Roe v. Wade. I would not necessarily ask him to predict how he
would rule on Roe v. Wade. I would, however, insist that he answer
what his analysis of Roe v. Wade is and what guidelines and what
standards he would use. And that is not only reasonable, it is abso-
lutely necessary. An ideology is necessary, and I would like to point
out to the conservative members of this committee, as well as, of
course, the less conservative or liberal or moderate members of the
committee, that Phillip Kurland, the conservative law professor at
the University of Chicago, has said, "It is not any more unfair for
the Senate to have ideological grounds to oppose a nominee, than
for the President to nominate someone on those grounds." That is
from the Washington Post, July 1, 1987, 1989.

  So the point is his ideology is important. Why must this commit-
tee operate in ignorance? Why must women in this country be
forced to live in ignorance, because somehow he does not want to
answer the question. Ideology has played a part for many years in
the history of these proceedings, we know that. Talk about a litmus
test, talk about Chief Justice Rutledge, John Rutledge, President
Washington's first appointee as Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, who was rejected on one ground, because of his interpreta-
tion of a treaty with Great Britain-yes, we have a right to even
one ground-yes, we have a right to even one litmus test, especially
when it is about life and death.

  Not only a right, but I would urge all of you Senators to please
recall Judge Souter back to this table and require that he answers
where he stands on abortion. Chairman Biden and other members
of this committee, if he were a member of the Ku Klux Klan or the
Nazi Party, I have no doubt, because of your fine records as Sena-
tors, you would say to him, "I must know how you would rule, or I
must know your analysis on issues involving the Nazi Party, I
must know your analysis of the Ku Klux Klan." That one thing
alone, because it has so much impact on blacks and other minori-
ties in our country, would be sufficient to disqualify him, I have no
doubt, as a member of the United States Supreme Court.

  Yes, his position on Roe v. Wade alone should be sufficient to dis-
qualify him.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Allred and for the remainder of the panel, I
am not asking what we should or could ask. We know that. I wrote
that speech and so I understand that. As a matter of fact, I respect-
fully suggest, to the chagrin of my colleagues on my right, that
that issue was an issue first raised not too long ago by me, when
every editorial writer in the country was writing we had no right
to ask or expect to know certain things. So, I have no disagreement
about that.

  My question for the remainder of the panel is this: What would
have satisfied you, not what satisfies me or what we have a right to
ask or what we have a right to know, what is what you would have
a right to insist on knowing? Is it sufficient to know that he be-
lieved there was a fundamental right to privacy relating to termi-
nation of pregnancy, or is it required for you to know, as well, pre-
cisely how he would rule on Roe v. Wade? That is the question I
am asking you.
                                               703

  Ms. NEUBORNE. I think it is the first part, if we knew that he
believed there was a fundamental right to privacy, basically as de-
fined in Roe, that a woman had a right to make a decision of when
and whether to carry to term, and that that was as fundamental
right--again, that is an important piece, as I know you know, that
he is not saying--that would be sufficient, because then, under our
standard of laws, it would require a compelling State interest to re-
strict that, and there would have to be defined what that compel-
ling State interest is, and that decision would be made with the
utmost seriousness.

  What we are hearing is that some aspects of privacy are protect-
ed and we know that if there is just a simple right that is not
deemed fundamental, then practically any government regulation
would be deemed sufficient to overrule that, and that is our legiti-
mate concern, so that is the point that we felt had to be made.

  As you know, Senator Biden, our concern here is that he has
been open and forthright on other issues, again using church-state
as an example, in areas of the law where there will be changes,
where he admitted that the law perhaps was not settled and would
likely be changed, and he had no compunction in those areas about
discussing the underpinnings of those laws, what the core issues
were there. It is only in the area of privacy that he has refused to
tell us what the basic fundamental right is.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Mr. Chairman, I do not know if I could answer
the hypothetical question of what would satisfy me, because I think
you would have to take many factors into account, including the
nature of his reasoning and his ability to hear.
  But I can tell you what does not satisfy me, and the fact is that
this committee does not even have a commitment from Judge
Souter that there is a right to privacy with respect to abortion,
that there is a right to privacy even for married people with re-
spect to the use of contraception. We need to have those commit-
ments.
  He was willing to come here and say to you, "I believe the Con-
stitution permits States and the Federal Government to impose the
death penalty." Can he not say "I believe the Constitution allows
people to use contraceptives, that that is a fundamental right?" I
think also that it is especially important that he give a statement
on the fundamental right, given, as other members of the panel
pointed out, and I myself, other factors in his background that
raise questions about the respect that he gives to women and their
rights, particularly in the area, as I pointed out in the rape shield,
in the area of privacy there, and also with regards to prior state-
ments on abortion.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. My time is up.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, we have a lovely group of
ladies here. We thank you for your presence. I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I welcome all of you here and we appreciate the fervent testimo-
nies that you have given.
                                                704

  Now, Ms. Holtzman, I am concerned somewhat about your criti-
cism of Judge Souter's opinion in the case State v. Colbath, and
that was a unanimous decision of the New Hampshire Supreme
Court. As I read your statement, you claim that Souter and all the
rest of the New Hampshire supreme court simply ignored the
State's rape shield law. You claim that Judge Souter failed to ana-
lyze the issue, and you point out the injury suffered by the woman
in the case.

  Now, the clear implication of your statement, as I read it, is that
the defendant caused the woman's injuries and you mentioned
them in connection with Judge Souter's holding on the rape shield
issue, is to support your view that Judge Souter was somehow in-
sensitive about rape issues and women's rights in that area, but I
think there is more to that case.

  In that case, there was a third party, the defendant's live-in com-
panion who, as I read the case, surprised the prosecutrix and the
defendant in the act of sexual intercourse and then assaulted the
woman and caused her injuries. Now, that certainly raised a jury
question as to who assaulted whom, thus making relevant some of
the evidence that would not be admissible in an ordinary rape case.

  Now, that key fact distinguished the Colbath case from the
standard rape shield case. In this particular case, the New Hamp-
shire State supreme court felt that there was an important sixth
amendment right or issue involved, meaning a defendant's right to
confront the witnesses against him in this case.

  Now, it seems to me that Judge Souter cannot win, by your rea-
soning. If he refuses the defendant's argument that he is entitled
under the Sixth Amendment to have the evidence in Colbath ad-
mitted, then he is accused of ignoring the defendant's rights. If he
admits the evidence, then he is accused of being insensitive to
women's rights.

  Now, these are kind of tough questions that require fine lines to
be drawn. These cases are very difficult and no one, least of all
myself, wants to see anybody harmed who may have a right cause
in those kinds of cases, and that is why we need judges to take
their task seriously and make every effort to get to the bottom of
the problem, as Judge Souter did in that particular case.

  I just wanted to point that out, because I think that that is a cor-
rect statement of the facts in the Colbath case, and I just

  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Senator, might I respond?
  Senator HATCH. Surely.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Obviously, the issue in all of these cases is the
question of the defendant's right to introduce relevant evidence
and the sixth amendment right to confront the evidence, confront
the witnesses against him or her and to adduce evidence in his or
her behalf.
  But the question that the rape shield law tries to address is that
the idea of relevance is one that was based in the past on some
very antiquated notions. The point was to try to suggest to judges
that what they might have thought was relevant was really not
only irrelevant, but profoundly misleading to juries, injurious as to
the ability of State to prosecute cases, and injurious and humiliat-
ing to the complaining witness.
                                               705

  That's the concern here. The concern here is not even so much
with the result, although I would have--just from my reading of
the facts of the case, another result could have been justified--my
concern is the language that he uses and the lack of reasoning.

  I mean the very fact that he tossed aside as trivial the possibility
of prejudice to the jury from the introduction of prior evidence
about a woman's prior sexual act, the fact of the matter is, and I
know this case-after-case, and study-after-study has shown that it is
highly prejudicial to juries.

  Now, he might have said, even though it is prejudicial to juries, I
still think it's important, but he didn't show any sense of under-
standing the prejudice. The same with respect to the issue about
the relevance of her prior conduct.

  It might have been relevant--let's assume hypothetically--but
he didn't explain how it was. Instead he accused her of being sexu-
ally provocative, as though somehow she provoked the rape, and
that is exactly the point that I was trying to say that the rape
shield laws were trying to address.

  So I find the language of this very troublesome from that point
of view.

  Senator HATCH. I didn't read it that way. I read it that he was
concerned that there wasn't justice done here. I think the case does
show his concern for the strict enforcement of defendant's legiti-
mate constitutional rights.

  Ms. NEUBORNE. Senator
  Senator HATCH. I would like to just finish. Let me finish this one
thought and then I would be happy to let you speak.
  The challenged evidence, in my opinion, was necessary to the de-
fendant's case because, No. 1, it related to public acts. And, No. 2, I
might say public acts, not private matters that the rape shield law
was designed to protect. And, No. 3, the evidence in the case ap-
peared to be particularly strong since the acts occurred closely in
time to the actual time of the alleged assault.
  So, I mean who would know unless the case was really retried
and this opportunity to hear this evidence was really heard or
given? All I'm pointing out is I think you may be right, but I don't
think the case shows that. I think the case shows to the contrary.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Well, with all due respect, Senator, I think that
the case, at least his reasoning, is absent with regard with regard
to why her prior sexual flirtation has anything to do with whether
she consented.
  I mean the theory of relevance here is that if she flirted with
some other men that she would consent to a rape. You explain to
me the relevance of one or the logical connection between one and
the other, he didn't.
  Senator HATCH. Well, basically, Souter did not accuse her of
being sexually provocative. He said he wanted the jury to deter-
mine whether the complainant was lying to cover her embarrass-
ment to be discovered by the defendant's real lover or girlfriend,
but let me go a little bit further.
  That is one side. I don't think you're right on it and I wanted to
just point it out because we should both re-read the case. But let
me point out another case in the case of State v.
                                               706

  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Excuse me, if I could just read to you from the
case.

  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. There was evidence, this is a quote on the very
first page, in fact, it is the second paragraph, "there was evidence
that she directed sexually provocative attention toward several
men in the bar."
  Senator HATCH. That's different from saying that she did that.
He said there was evidence. That doesn't mean it is true, and it
doesn't mean it is false. Any judge worth his salt would point that
out.
  Let me point out another case just to show the other side of it. In
the case of State y. Dueette, Judge Souter reaffirmed the important
right of a rape victim to have her case prosecuted free of judicial
inquiry into irrelevant and immaterial aspects of the victim's pri-
vate life.
  This is what he did in this case. In that case the accused rapist
sought court permission to conduct discovery into a prior sexual as-
sault that the victim had undergone some, as I recall, seven years
prior to this alleged crime.
  Judge Souter held and held firmly that this request was properly
denied. That he couldn't bring that evidence out of seven years ago,
another rape of this victim. That was properly denied because the
evidence that was sought was immaterial to any issue involved in
this later prosecution.
  In other words, I think if you re-read this first case, the mere
fact that he said there was evidence, I mean that is what the evi-
dence showed
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. NO, it was how he characterized the evidence,
not that there was. If you characterize it as provocative, that sug-
gests that she was somehow provoking the action on the part of the
defendant and that is the problem that the rape shield laws, I
think, and a lot of the work that we have tried to do over the years
to permit effective prosecution of rape cases is designed to counter
the idea that the woman is provoking the rape.
  Senator HATCH. I agree with you on the necessity for rape shield
laws and the necessity of protecting the women under these cir-
cumstances. I think his case shows that he agrees with you, and,
certainly, this latter case shows that he agrees with you. All I'm
pointing out is that I'm not sure that the criticism is as well-placed
as you feel.
  Now, let me just say this. I happened to listen very carefully to
all of your testimony and, I respect you for it. Ms. Yard, we have
known each other for a long time. Your testimony was very
moving. It was very sincere. It was eloquent. So was yours, Ms.
Smeal, and others as well. I don't mean to slight anybody here.
  I respect you for it. But there is another point of view that is
equally as moving, equally as relevant, equally as felt about, and
equally as emotionally appealing.
  I think that's what we have in this country is we have a tremen-
dously issue that has two sides to it. That if you ask the right ques-
tions, you are likely to find majorities on one side or the other, de-
pending upon the questions. And everybody in this country seems
to be concerned about it.
                                             707

  Now, what I'm concerned is if we do go to single-litmus test
issues to determine whether a person sits on the Court--I read an
article by Ben Wattenburg, a Democrat, who said that the real
litmus test issue is not abortion, it's quotas.

  Now, what if 15 Senators felt that if this man is for quotas, they
couldn't vote for him, or against quotas, they couldn't vote for
them? What if 15 Senators who felt that school prayer is very im-
portant to them and they wouldn't vote for anybody who was not
for school prayer? Or 15 Senators who won't vote for anybody who
is for the death penalty or against the death penalty?

  In other words, if we bring this down to single-litmus test issues,
no matter how important, or how emotionally compelling they are
to various people, my goodness I'm not sure we would have very
good people ever sit on the Supreme Court, or we would ever be
able to resolve these very difficult issues.

  So I just point that out because I respect you for your viewpoint.
I disagree with it, but I respect you for it.

  Ms. YARD. But you must remember that every poll in every State
and nationally shows that the vast majority believes that it is a
woman's right to determine whether or not she will have an abor-
tion

  Senator HATCH. And every poll, in every State shows that the
vast majority of people think it's abominable for us to have 2 mil-
lion abortions in this country every year and

  Ms. YARD. That is not the
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. To become the most, except for
Mainland China, the most permissive country with regard to abor-
tion in the world. And most everybody is concerned of finding some
way of resolving this issue. Now, we're never going to agree on
these things. The point
  Ms. YARD. But the point is
  Senator HATCH. The point I'm making
  Ms. YARD. The point is not whether somebody thinks it's wrong
or right. What the polls show is that people believe that you should
make the decision yourself. We aren't insisting that people who
oppose abortion have them at all. What we are insisting is that
each one of us has the right to make the decision for herself.
  I don't insist that they have an abortion, and, by the same token,
they can't insist that I can't make the choice not to have one.
  Senator HATCH. And there may be some way of
  Ms. YARD. That's the issue.
  Senator HATCH. There may be some way of resolving this issue, if
it is instead of deciding by nine unelected judges, all of whom were
men at the time, if it is decided by elected representatives of the
people and you may very well win on your contentions. You may
very well win. But the point is that there are two sides.
  There are two emotional sides, and there are two equally felt-out
sides, and if you ask different polling questions, you will find there
are different majorities on different aspects of that issue.
  Now, we could argue about it for hours and for days and months
and years, which has happened around here. But my main point is
this, that if we come down to single-litmus test issues to determine
whether a person ever sits on the Court and we divide the Senate
on litmus-test issues, we will never have any Supreme Court.
                                 708

We have got to sometimes make these decisions based on the
quality of the people, the competence of the people, the ability of
the people, the health of the people, and a number of other issues
that are far broader than just one or any single-litmus test, as im-
portant as this may be to you, and it is important, and I admire
you for feeling the way you do.
I can never get mad at somebody who really believes in what
they do. I might disagree violently, but I never, never will find
fault with your sincere belief. I will just have to tell you that.
But my time is up. I have taken so much time as it is.
Ms. NEUBORNE. I just want to make a comment on that.
Ms. YARD. I don't want your admiration. What I want is for you
to understand that it is totally unacceptable to turn back the clock.
This body, the Senate Judiciary Committee, has made it very clear
that you can't be a racist and sit on the Supreme Court. Well, I say
you can't be a sexist and sit on one, too.
If you don't understand what freedom for women means, you
don't deserve to be on the Court.
Senator HATCH. Well, from your point of view, I will respect you
for that point of view, but there is another point of view that is
equally as forceful. I have to tell you that.
Ms. SMEAL. And we don't know what Souter's point of view is.
Senator HATCH. Neither do I.
Ms. SMEAL. Well, the point of the matter is that you know, for he
must be worried about what the public would think of his point of
view, because he is refusing to say it.
We know, from his past record, that his point of view has been
not only on the issue of abortion and privacy opposed to women's
rights, but also on every other case that he has taken with gender
discrimination at issue he has been on the side against eliminating
gender discrimination.
Senator HATCH. I just showed you one where he was on your
side. I can show you others. So  the  fact  is  that  is  just  sim! ply  not  a
true statement. My time's up.
Ms. ALLRED. Senator Hatch, may I just say it's not a shell game.
It's not a shell game where he can't, he doesn't have to answer
what is under this shell but he will answer what's under that shell
as it pleases him. That's what is unfair.
Of course, it goes well beyond the issue of abortion. We're talking
about precedent. We're talking about seventeen years of precedent,
where Roe v. Wade has been challenged time after time after time
for 17 years, and of course, will be challenged again in Russ v. Sul-
livan in the November term, so this is an issue that is well beyond
abortion. He has a duty to answer these questions. The Senator
should not allow him to avoid answering what we all know is the
key question.
Senator HATCH. I have to tell you as a circuit court of appeals
judge
The CHAIRMAN. I have to tell you all this, your time's up. But
please finish your thought.
Senator HATCH. I know it's up, but I'm going to finish this
thought here. As a circuit court of appeals judge, I don't believe
that's correct. I think he has an obligation not to talk about issues
                                      709
that he knows are presently and currently on the Supreme Court's
list.

  It's an ethical obligation, and I think that he should not preju-
dice his right to be able to rule in those matters by telling us in
advance how he is going to rule. I would be very upset if he did, in
fact, I might not support him if he did do that.

  So, that's the problem and he knows that the Russ case is on
that list and so does everybody else. That is not the only one that is
going to come up. There are going to be all kinds of cases until this
matter is resolved by elected representatives rather than unelected
judges.

  It will never go away until it is, and it may not go away then,
but at least people are going to say a majority has ruled one way or
the other and you may very well win.

  Ms. ALLRED. Senator, I have additional
  The CHAIRMAN. I'm sorry, I am not going to allow the answer.
You can maybe figure out the answer in response to a non-question
from the next person. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I didn't mean that quite the way that sounded.
You may answer the question, Senator Hatch, in avoiding an
answer from Senator Simpson but we have to move on.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. I have seen
these women here before as we dealt with issues. It is a particular
pleasure to see Elizabeth Holtzman, who I always enjoyed working
with on various issues. We worked together on illegal immigration
reform legislation and I have great regard and respect for you. I do
not know the other women that well.
  But obviously, you know, we're in it deep right now. And I look
at the testimony of Ms. Yard. A statement of Judge Souter's, you
quote on page 8, that "I don't think unlimited abortion should be
allowed." That was Souter's statement, "I don't think unlimited
abortion should be allowed."
  Then you go on to say that "Senators, this is the language of the
right wing." And then you go on to right wing it some more.
  As you know, I am pro-choice. I strongly support a woman's right
to choose and however, I'm always concerned about sweeping state-
ments. You show me a 100 percenter and I will show you a person
I like to stay away from. I don't care what the issue is. That's my
view of life, just mine, my personal opinion.
  So I see sweeping statements, filled charged statements, emotion-
al statements and all of you are very skilled at this. You do more
talk shows than we will ever do on the U.S. Senate floor. You are
very good at your work.
  So is Faye Wattleton and so is Kate Michelman. So let's get that
out. There is power and potency in what you say, but you know
how to get it across and you know just exactly what you're doing
here. There is no naiveness here, no naivete. You are it. So now,
let's just go forward here.
  So, I'm always concerned with that. If you support unlimited
abortion rights I do think you do a disservice to the cause we
share, to ensure that women do have this freedom to choose. Be-
cause even Roe v. Wade--don't shrug, I see that all the time. I get
                                      710
tired of watching shrugs and kind of looking up at the ceiling when
Strom Thurmond says something courteous.

  Let's just stay in this picture and just listen for a minute. Maybe
that wouldn't be an untoward and maybe it might even be a cour-
teous thing to do, without casting a glance and a shrug and "who
are these boobs?" And "how did they not listen to what we say to
them and can't they hear us?" That is a tiresome arrogance.

  So Roe v. Wade presents limits on abortions, ladies, such as when
pregnancy is in its third trimester. I think that limitation happens
to be reasonable. I am also not very enthusiastic at all about abor-
tions performed simply because the sex of the fetus is not the sex
that the parents wanted. I don't really go for that one.

  Could not you discern that opposition to unlimited abortion
rights might not just be a position of the right wing, but a position
of many of us who support the right to choose as well? I will ask
you that, Ms. Yard?

  Ms. YARD. I don't read my testimony, Senator Simpson, as saying
that we are supporting unlimited abortions, one-after-another.
What I am saying is that that is the charge of the right wing and I
am pointing out how ludicrous the charge is. That is all I'm saying.

  Furthermore, if you object to abortion for sex selection I invite
you to join the National Organization for Women. We do not be-
lieve that there should be distinctions between men and women,
boys and girls. We want an integrated society and we want every-
one to be treated equally, so that I invite you to join us in our
struggle to have people treated equally.

  And I would
  Senator SIMPSON. I don't know what that has to do with it.
  Ms. YARD [continuing]. Through you, if I might, apologize to
Strom Thurmond if he didn't like my glances but we are greeted
every time we come before him as ladies, you are all so attractive.
Somehow it does not sit well. Maybe you could explain to him that
we would like to be treated the way you treat everybody else. You
don't say to men, gentlemen, you all look lovely. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, you know, we don't have to whack
around in that stuff.
  Ms. YARD. I wish you would explain it to him because it doesn't
do him any good.
  Senator SIMPSON. He's a man of great civility and a southern
gentleman of the first order and if you don't like the way he ex-
presses himself, what business is that of yours? You ought to roll
your eyes at it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Maybe we could kind of move on. I'm not being
facetious when I say, I think it would be useful for us to get to the
issue, if we could.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I would like to get back to page 10 of
your testimony. You quote Professor Alan Dershowitz saying that
"Judge Souter was nominated, in effect, by John Sununu, a stri-
dent opponent of a woman's right to choose."
  Could you please tell us what qualifications or experience Alan
Dershowitz possesses in the area of White House politics or what
evidence does the professor base his speculation? I know that Pro-
fessor Dershowitz jumps in with both feet in all of these issues.
                                      711

  I have shared a talk show or two with him. I won't ever do one
by remote control, he takes that talk show word literally, no one
else gets to talk. I would like to do it face-to-face with him the next
time.

  But what is the qualification, how does he know this? This has
been refuted by many already. What is the old saw here, with this
one?

  Ms. YARD. Well, Alan Dershowitz is a respected professor of
law

  Senator SIMPSON. Of course he is.
  Ms. YARD [continuing]. At Harvard University.
  Senator SIMPSON. I didn't say he wasn't.
  Ms. YARD. And I suspect he knows very well what he is writing.
Now, if you would like us to do a study of John Sununu and submit
it to this body, we would be happy to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. But you see, what I'm saying is that your state-
ment is filled with flash words, and flash statements and that,
somewhere that breaks down. I think you do yourself, my personal
opinion, a disservice in a cause that I believe in too.
  But I would like to ask--well, let me just put it this way since we
are sharing some emotion here. We have now a claim by Ms. Smeal
that this person is unsuitable to the Supreme Court unless he or
she expresses a commitment to basic constitutional freedoms.
  And then the ABA has given a unanimous well-qualified rating
to the nominee who does not believe in basic constitutional free-
doms? That seems odd, because that is exactly where that logic
leads, they have given Judge Souter their highest ratings.
  Why would it be so that they would give that rating if there
were any credibility to that assertion that there is nothing in his
record that he would assure basic liberties? I am going to finish the
whole question because I know that probably I won't get any more.
  But there is a question that you asked on page 12 of your testi-
mony. You stated there, and back to Ms. Yard.

   Why Judge David Souter? What was the basic purpose in advancing this nomina-
tion of a man with no substantial discernable record.

  Well, I respectfully say, ladies, or women, that the answer to
that question is that because of the job and the work you went to
on Judge Robert Bork, the White House had to do a different kind
of proposal. If I may add, it was a hatchet job, where we turned a
man into a racist, a sexist, a sterilizer of women, that was all part
of it.

  I sat and listened to it. I have a little institutional memory. So
the White House now has to find bright, thoughtful, intelligent,
skillful, qualified judges who do not have a paper trail of any kind.

  That is what they have to find. This is my view, not the White
House, I have not talked with them. And Judge Souter certainly
fits that description, except that I would place the word "very" in
front of each adjective to describe Judge Souter: very intelligent,
very qualified, very bright. So you know, I think you have been
hoist on your own petard.

  You have only yourselves to blame for the nomination of some-
one with "no substantial discernable record." You took one that
was discernable in the form of law review articles and things that
                                          712

had never even appeared, never even paid one whit of attention,
and ignored 5.5 years of a man on the bench, with 104 opinions--
and six of his dissents became majority opinions of the U.S. Su-
preme Court--and none of his decisions was ever overturned and
you turned him into a gargoyle right before this committee.

   So, that's why. Thank heaven though, we do have this man,
Souter. How fortunate we are to have a man of his caliber. So if
you hadn't hung old Robert Bork so high up in the cottonwood
trees, you wouldn't be here asking that question you did on page 12
of your statement.

   Ms. ALLRED. Senator Simpson, may I respond briefly to some of
the points you just made?

   Senator SIMPSON. I would like it, you bet.
   Ms. ALLRED. Thank you, very much, sir.
  First of all, I really think it is very unfair to blame the victims.
To blame women for the fact that Judge Souter has no paper trail
and has not been forced to answer, by this committee, where he
stands on abortion, and therefore, we have to go into that dark
night with little or no information of where he stands on this issue
is not, it is patently unfair to blame women for this.
  I want to add one thing, which I will get in, as per Chairman
Biden's instructions, which is this committee should know and I
am sure does know that the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct Canon
7(B)(l)(c) does not stop or prohibit or prevent Judge Souter from an-
swering any questions.
  The proof of that is it talks about a candidate, including an in-
cumbent judge for judicial office that is filled either by public elec-
tion between competing candidates or the basis of a merit system
election. It talks about election. It doesn't talk about a judge that is
going to be there by appointment. It is clear by the language, you
could ask him where he stands on these issues.

  Senator SIMPSON. What were you reading from, Ms. Allred?
  Ms. ALLRED. I am reading, sir, from the Georgetown Journal of
Legal Ethics Article that I cited earlier, but I am reading the exact
quote that I just read is from the American Bar Association's Code
of Judicial Conduct specifically Canon 7(B)(l)(c).
  Senator SIMPSON. GO to three please if you would, may I respect-
fully say, and you will find that a sitting judge cannot respond,
cannot respond to questions about pending or impending legislation
and I cite it for you right in the same document you have in your
hand. That is the canon, also, at least among judges ethically.
  Ms. ALLRED. Well, if that is the case, he has already done it, sir.
He has done it talking about the War Powers Act. There is going to
be a pending case before him on that. He has done it on the Lemon
test, and on religious cases.
  Senator SIMPSON. MS. Allred, he is a sitting judge. He is not a
simple, you know, it is not a simple nomination. The man is a sit-
ting judge and if you will look at the Code of Ethics that you have
in your hand, you will see that he cannot respond to questions,
ethically, of a pending or impending nature.
  Now, I don't know how clear--I have said that about four times
since this started and everyone just shrugs and pooh-poohs that
one. That is pretty real. It is right there, right there.
  Ms. ALLRED. He has already done it on numerous issues.
                                      713
  Ms. NEUBORNE. He did not have to answer a question about a
pending case, Senator. He was asked to discuss the concepts, the
concepts that underlie the principles of the fundamental right that
exists for 20 years. As he talked about fundamental concepts in
other areas, on equal protection. He talked about where those un-
derlying concepts came from.
  And again, in--I take Senator Biden at his word that I can
answer a nonquestion--when we talked about this being a single
issue, I must say that when Brown v. Board of Education was the
law very recently and Justice Stewart was being appointed to this
Court, he was asked how he would have ruled on that case.
  That was considered a reasonable question at that time. I would
say that if that were the issue now, that is certainly a monumen-
tally important single issue and if that answer were the wrong
answer, I would say that he perhaps would not be sitting on the
Court. It was valid to ask how the lives of African-Americans and
people of color would be with that Justice sitting on the Court,
given the change in the law on equal protection and it is just as
important for women to know where their fundamental rights will
be with another Justice sitting on the Court.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, you have been very kind, but
there really is only one case that he was concerned about and could
not speak on and it was because of ethics, not because of some
great escape mechanism. If you don't recognize that then you don't
recognize the portion of the ethics that you just read.
  That's the difference here. This is not just some nominee. This is
a sitting judge and the first thing that everybody wanted to know
was about Roe v. Wade and there it is and that is why he couldn't
respond.
  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you, Senator.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Controller Holtzman, I would like to discuss with you the Col-
bath case, because I think you have made a point that requires
some analysis to determine substance because if your analysis is
correct, and we have the opinion before us, then I think that has
some substantial probative weight.
  I agree with your statement that a woman has an absolute right
to say no at any time to any man. And that forced sex is rape
whether or not, well, forced sex is rape, we will end it there. In
your statement, you say, "at worst, the prior activities consisted of
very flirtatious behavior."
  I would respectfully disagree with you about that characteriza-
tion. There is a slightly different issue involved, in fact, a signifi-
cant different issue involved as to the prior contact between the
complaining witness and the defendant contrasted with other
people. But when you say that it was only flirtatious I think that
the contact with the defendant in the presence of the other men is
all relevant but starting with the other men.
  The testimony was more than the generalization of provocative
attention. "A girl with dark hair hanging over everyone and
making out with Richard Colbath." Then she had been sitting in
the lap of one of the defendant's companions. Then "engaged in
                                      714

close physical contact with at least one man besides the defend-
ant."

  Then, as to the defendant, himself--and I think this is relevant
although there is that distinction that I mentioned--when you
raise a question about provocation saying that the complaining wit-
ness provoked the rape--and this is somewhat delicate, but pros-
ecutors like you and I know that you have to be specific in a court-
room.

  I think it is important because I think you have raised a very
significant issue here, and I think it has to be discussed. As direct
as this is, I think the testimony has to be articulated.

  So, I give some advance notice to those who are watching on tele-
vision that this is what happened, as the opinion of the Court says,
with respect to the defendant. He testified that he had engaged in
"feeling the complainant's breasts and bottom, and that she had
been rubbing his crotch before the two of them eventually left the
tavern and went to the defendant's trailer." Now, I would say to
you that, as I read that conclusively, it is a lot more than flirta-
tious behavior.

  You raised the contention that Judge Souter had not made any
analysis here and had not really considered the question of preju-
dice. I know you have the case before you, and at page 1216, this is
what Judge Souter said, in part:

  "Thus, this court has held that a rape defendant must be given
an opportunity to demonstrate that the probative value of the
statutorily inadmissible evidence in the context of that particular
case outweighs its prejudicial effect on the prosecutrix.

  Later on page 1216, the court says,

  As soon as we address this process of assigning relative weight to prejudicial and
probative force, it becomes apparent that the public character of the complainant's
behavior is significant.

  Now, this case is considered, as the opinion of the court says, in
the context of the State and national constitutional rights that a
defendant has to confront the witnesses against him and to present
his own exculpatory evidence.

  Now, district attorneys have an obligation to be scrupulously fair
to everyone and it is a balancing test which he undertakes here.
But as I read the opinion, Judge Souter relies on some pretty posi-
tive evidence as to physical contact and action between the defend-
ant and the prosecutrix in the presence of the other men, and then
the physical contact and the analysis as to prejudice, and he might
be right or he might be wrong in his final conclusion.

  You could write this opinion coming out the other way and say
that it was too prejudicial, but it seems to me that it is a scholarly
opinion and well within the ambit of reasonableness for his conclu-
sion.

  I would be interested in his comments.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Well, Senator, I am very well aware that there is
a constitutional limitation with respect to the rape privacy law.
The Federal rule that I wrote explicitly requires that judges take
that into account. That is not the issue here, it seems to me.
  It begs the question to say there was a constitutional right.
There would be a constitutional right, if the evidence were relevant
                                      715
and if the evidence were probative. Further than that, it is also a
question of weighing the prejudice, because the State has an inter-
est here, too, as cases have announced, States have an interest in
rape privacy laws, because of the interest in encouraging women to
come forward and testify.

  You are certainly well aware, as a distinguished district attor-
ney, of the history of the rape privacy law. The reason for it was
that any time a woman took the stand, her entire sexual activity
could be brought to the attention of the jury, on the theory that if
a woman ever said yes, she was not going to say no.

  It had another purpose, and that is building on the myths and
prejudices about rape, trying to enflame the jury's feeling that a
woman who was not chaste, was not believable, and fostering a per-
petuation of the myths.

  Now, what you have here is, No. 1, as I said in my testimony, the
judge says, and I quote here, and this is on page 1217, "Because
little significance can be assigned to"--let me skip here--"to a fear
of misleading the jury." Why is little significance assigned to fear
of misleading the jury, when the scholarly opinion, and research
has been done on this, shows that prejudice to the jury is a factor.
He didn't recognize that.

  I am not saying that he could not have said, "I recognize that
there is a possible prejudice here to the jury, but the defendant's
rights overweigh that.' He just ignored the little--dismissed this
area of prejudice, which is very important.

  Similarly, he did not say the evidence about her past behavior--
by the way, I should say, Senator, that that is the defendant's ver-
sion of her behavior. The complaining witness 'version of her be-
havior was very different.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Ms. Holtzman
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. In any case, let us assume for the moment and
take the defendant's version
  Senator SPECTER. Wait a minute. This is a question of admissibil-
ity and weight to be given by the jury. You are not saying that be-
cause it is the defendant's version, that it is not entitled to be con-
sidered?
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Under the rape shield law, the decision is really
to be made by the judge as to the question of relevance and the
question of prejudice. That is to be made by the judge, not the jury.
That is the whole purpose of having the rape shield law, it is to
take this issue from the jury and then you--
  Senator SPECTER. Well, that does not bear on whether the defend-
ant can testify.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. NO; I did not say the defendant, I said that
the
  Senator SPECTER. Well, you said "his version," as if his version is
entitled to less weight.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. NO; I am just saying
  Senator SPECTER. Both versions are entitled to weight.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. Exactly, that is the point I am making and it is
the point I am trying to make. We do not hear in Judge Souter's
opinion anything about a different version of the facts, but let us
assume the facts are the way the defendant, no matter how he pre-
sented that evidence, let us assume the facts were as the defendant
                                      716

claimed them to be. Let us assume exactly what happened hap-
pened.

   If the complaining witness behaved in this fashion with the de-
fendant, would you call this provocative, in the sense that this pro-
voked a rape? Is that the word you would use to describe it? That is
what troubles me, the language that is used by Judge Souter here.

   Now, this may be language suggesting--this may be conduct
that

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, I am confused. May I ask a question
of both of you?

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. IS the issue whether or not the conduct provoked
a rape or the conduct went to the credibility of the assertion that it
was consent or rape?

  Senator SPECTER. The latter.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. NO, no, no. The question of prejudice goes to
the
  The CHAIRMAN. I do not know, that is why I am asking.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. The question of the prejudice goes to the credibil-
ity, because if you can show that a woman is not "chaste," you
have a chance of affecting the jury's view of her credibility.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. What troubles me is the fact that Judge Souter
characterized her behavior, in his words, as sexually provocative,
provocative meaning provoking something. Does that mean provok-
ing the rape? Does that mean the victim is to blame?

   The CHAIRMAN. NO; I

  Ms. HOLTZMAN. That is what troubles me about this.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand. I am not sure I disagree with you.
I did not realize that he was using the word in that way. I did not
know how he was using the word, whether he was using it that it
provoked a rape, or whether or not it was provocative and, there-
fore, went to the question of the credibility of the witness of the
woman alleging to have been raped, as to whether or not she con-
sented or she was raped, not whether or not it justified any action
whatsoever on the part of the man.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. He does not parse it that way, but there is no
reason to think that it would not affect--and that is one of the rea-
sons for the rape shield law, that it would not affect the jury's view
of her credibility. In fact, as we quoted this judge in 1835, that a
chaste woman is more likely to be believable, less likely to have
given consent, and that is the problem and that is the problem of
prejudice of using this evidence, and that is why there is a very
careful balancing test that we urge on judges, and I do not see any
real realization in this opinion of the care that is required and that
is balancing test and that is my concern.
  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize for the interruption.
  Ms. NEUBORNE. Could I add a comment to that?
  Senator SPECTER. YOU may, but let me finish this exchange with
Comptroller Holtzman.
  He does specifically put this in the context of consent and that is
in the very first paragraph, at the conclusion, where the judge
talks about the defense of consent. With all due respect, Ms. Holtz-
man, I think you are not on the central issue, when you talk about
                                         717

the issue of being chaste raises a question of credibility. The issue
of chaste--and chaste is the wrong concept, but I use your word,
just to follow up with you

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. I am quoting from the judge and perhaps you
were not here to hear the beginning of my testimony.

   Senator SPECTER. If I can finish here, chaste raises the issue of
consent. But never mind the question of chaste, where you pick on
the word "provocative" and say that there is an issue here that her
conduct provoked the rape. I do not believe that is what Judge
Souter is saying at all.

   He is saying that if you have a context where a woman in a bar,
according to the defendant's testimony--and again, on a very basic
point, it is not a question of whether you assume he is correct or
not, we are talking about admissibility of evidence to go to a jury--
as to whether the jury believes him or believes the woman, not a
question of assuming it for purpose of this legal issue. It is a ques-
tion of whether the jury hears it. We are not assuming it one way
or another.

   But when you talk about relevancy and you say you do not see
the relevancy, if you have a situation where a man and a woman
are in a bar and the critical testimony in question is that "he is
feeling the complainant's breasts and bottom and that she had
been rubbing his crotch" all in a consensual context, then the issue
is, if sexual intercourse occurs later, is that relevant that the
sexual intercourse was consensual as far as she was concerned.

   Now, it may not have been, but the issue on relevance is does
this kind of contact, where a man feels the complainant's breasts
and bottom and she rubs his crotch, is that relevant as to whether
a later act of sex was consensual or not, it seems to me to be direct-
ly relevant, especially in terms of the time sequence. You talk
about it being hours later. It happened and they went directly to
the trailer.

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Excuse me, Senator, I do not think the opinion is
very clear on the issue of time. The fact of the matter is that they
went to the bar apparently 6 hours before the alleged rape took
place, according to newspaper reports about it, so the time se-
quence here is not at all very clear in that respect. It may have
been a matter of 4 or 5 hours before this conduct took place, it may
have been a matter of 2 or 3 hours before or 15 minutes before. We
have no way of knowing from this opinion.

   But as I said to you, Senator, it is not
   Senator SPECTER. If you have no way of knowing, why do you say
that it is a long time?
   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Because it could have been 6 hours. There is
nothing to suggest that it was any closer than that, not from the
judge's opinion. But the issue is not simply one--well, I will say
that the rape evidence law, with all respect, raises two issues: One,
is it relevant; and, then two, is it prejudicial.
   One, on the issue of relevance, I do not necessarily agree with
you. Because she may have engaged in flirtatious behavior with
him, very flirtatious behavior with him
   Senator SPECTER. MS. Holtzman, is it flirtatious for him to rub
her breasts and bottom and her to rub his crotch? Is that what you
call flirtatious?
                                          718

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Well, I do not call that sexual intercourse, which
is what happens in rape, which is

   Senator SPECTER. Of course, it is not sexual intercourse, but is it
foreplay? Does that suggest that there is a consensual relationship
here, if he did not force her to do that?

   Ms. HOLTZMAN. It may

   The CHAIRMAN. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
   Ms. HOLTZMAN. Senator, it may suggest a consent to those acts.
It may not show consent to any other acts with respect to him.
Now, you are assuming that and that may reflect your own view of
the relevance, but I am not saying that anyone would necessarily
do that.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Holtzman, this may help clear it up for me,
and I say this to my colleague. We are way over time here, but let
me ask you: If the Judge had said, instead of saving provocative
conduct, if he had characterized the conduct as follows, "It was al-
leged that the following conduct took place," and then stated the
conduct, without characterizing it as provocative, that would be a
different story, would it not?
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. That would be part of it, yes, that would have
been a different story, in addition to other things in this opinion
that also

   The CHAIRMAN. OK. I

  Ms. HOLTZMAN. We did not get into all of them, but I expressed
them in my statement.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right. And I
  Ms. HOLTZMAN. I suggest a similar concern that I have used
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that.
  Ms. HOLTZMAN [continuing]. The language that is used to express
it.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that. I am very reluctant to cut off
what is a very informative debate, but we really are much over
time. But I will, obviously, as I always do, yield, if the Senator
wishes to continue, but I implore him not to ask me to continue.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will not pursue that line. I will let the
relevancy of that conduct speak for itself on the issue of consent,
but I would like to ask what I consider to be a very important ques-
tion for Ms. Yard to answer.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right, and then we will cease.
  Senator SPECTER. It is a question which I directed to Ms. Michel-
man and Ms. Wattleton this morning, and that is that if the Senate
does not give consent to Judge Souter, what expectation is there
that President Bush will nominate someone who will give you the
kind of commitment that you are looking for to sustain Roe v.
Wade?
  Ms. YARD. Well, I think that there are two answers to that ques-
tion. I remember very well, because I was part of it, the Haynes-
worth and Carswell battles. We were told we could never win
Haynesworth, and I was very active in Americans for Democratic
Action, and we were the only ones in the beginning who spoke out
against him. We won that and we finally got Blackmun, and I
think it is possible for President Bush to get a message. He can get
a message that this country feels very strongly about this, and he
has already changed his mind on the question of taxes, so I think it
                                         719

is very possible for him to change his mind on whom he might
nominate for the Supreme Court.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you all very, very much for your testimo-
ny and for the insight you provided to your position and to your
view as to why the nominee is, from your perspective, one of a posi-
tion that is opposed to Roe, not merely unknown, but opposed, and
I thank you for it very much. That will be it for this panel. Thank
you.
  Now, let me suggest to my colleagues, I indicated that we would
stop by 7 o'clock, but we have a problem and that is there are two
panels that I would like to combine, because there are two wit-
nesses who cannot be here tomorrow, even though they were told
they may not come up until tomorrow. I will not state who those
witnesses are, after having characterized it that way, but we will
get instructions.
  So, what we will do is we will bring up panel six and seven to-
gether. Now, on panel six, the names I am about to read are a
panel of witnesses who are all four coming to testify on behalf of,
in support of, Judge Souter; and panel seven, which will be com-
bined with this panel, is made up of two witnesses, both of whom
have not taken a position, but wish to express serious concerns.
  Now, let me read the panels: R. Eden Martin, a partner in the
Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin; William L. Dunfey, director of
Dunfey Group, in New Hampshire, a very prominent New Hamp-
shire citizen; Robert I. Ruiz, president of the National Hispanic
Bar, and that is the first panel; and then on the panel that wishes
to express their concern, sharing a different view, Sophia H. Hall,
president of the National Association of Women Judges; and Doris
Coleman, president of the California Women Lawyers.
  Now, I want to make it clear once again, in the interest of time
and accommodation, we are putting these two panels together. The
first three people who were called are testifying on behalf of, and
the last two witnesses are taking no position, but are going to raise
their concerns.
  So, why don't we begin, and I am going to hold you to the 5-
minute rule, even if it means I have to send Senator Thurmond
down after you. He is assisting me.
  It would be accommodating if we were to allow Mr. Ruiz to make
his statement first, because of time constraints. Is that correct, Mr.
Ruiz?
   Mr. Ruiz. That would be fine, Senator. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome, and why don't you begin first.

PANEL CONSISTING OF ROBERT I. RUIZ, PRESIDENT, HISPANIC
  NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION; WILLIAM L. DUNFEY, DIRECTOR,
  THE DUNFEY GROUP; R. EDEN MARTIN, SIDLEY & AUSTIN, CHI-
  CAGO, IL; HON. SOPHIA H. HALL, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSO-

                      STATEMENT OF ROBERT I. RUIZ

  Mr. Ruiz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee. I am very happy to be here today.
                                               720

  As I was introduced, I am Robert Ruiz and I am the president of
the Hispanic National Bar Association. I would like to thank you
and the other members of the committee for this opportunity to
testify on behalf of the Hispanic National Bar Association on the
nomination of Judge David Souter to be an Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  I also wish to thank the other members of our Washington mem-
bership and other members throughout the country who have been
very helpful in submitting suggestions for the testimony here
today.

  In the nearly 20 years of our organization's existence, this is the
second time that we have been invited to submit testimony on
behalf of a U.S. Supreme Court nominee. In 1987, we testified in
support of the nomination of now Associate Justice Kennedy.

  My purpose here today is twofold: One, I want to
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Mr. Ruiz. Again, for the record, be-
cause these things sometimes take on a life of their own, you may
have been invited by the White House. You are always welcome
before this committee, I want to make it clear, so no one thinks
that an organization as significant as yours has somehow only had
two opportunities to come here. You are able to come any time you
wish to come on any judge. You are welcome. The White House
may have invited you twice. You are always welcome here.
  Mr. Ruiz. I thank you very much for that correction. Thank you.
  My purpose here is twofold: First, I wish to report to you that
the Hispanic National Bar Association Board of Directors, by a
very close vote, did vote to support the nomination of Judge David
Souter for the Supreme Court. The board concluded in the state-
ment that it issued that they believed that, if confirmed, Judge
Souter would apply the law fairly and would demonstrate the un-
derstanding of the impact of civil rights rulings on the Hispanics,
women and other minorities of this country.
  However, the Hispanic National Bar Association endorsement is
not without reservations. It was the concern of many of our mem-
bers, reflected by some of the members of the board, that Judge
Souter lacks familiarity with the largest growing minority group in
the United States. He has not been exposed to issues of discrimina-
tion as they impact on Hispanics in the areas of education, employ-
ment, voting rights, and the delivery of other social services.
  Our board members also raise concerns regarding the Judge's po-
sitions when he was an assistant attorney general, regarding the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  While the United States v. New Hampshire case, that has been
discussed here often, may have been decided on what some consid-
er procedural matters, the role of an advocate is different than
that of a Supreme Court Justice, and our board was concerned that
his role as an advocate showed a lack of sensitivity for the impact
that his positions have on the concerns of minorities.
  Finally, concerns have been raised regarding Judge Souter's lack
of experience and sensitivity on issues that are of concern to
women, in general, and Hispanic women, in particular.
  While we would concede that there is no direct nexus between
Judge Souter's exposure to these issues and perhaps his compe-
                                      721

tence to serve as a justice, they do raise concerns which were re-
flected in the discussions of our members.

  We have chosen, however, to give Judge Souter the benefit of the
doubt and have chosen to be optimistic about the future of justice
as administered by the Supreme Court and by a Supreme Court
that would include Judge Souter.

  We are aware that many attorneys would find that Judge Souter
does not have the broad-based and favorable record on civil rights.
Our association is a bar association and our membership has much
broader concerns. When we voted to endorse Judge Souter, we
looked at his legal scholarship and the totality of his career and
experience.

  We would recommend that Judge Souter, however, read the case
of Hernandez v. Texas and the cases that followed which laid the
groundwork for the Supreme Court's determination of concerns in-
volving Hispanics.

  Our association will stand ready to assist Judge Souter at any
time and we would formally invite Judge Souter to our next His-
panic National Bar convention, which will be held in San Antonio
this fall. We have extended similar invitations to other nominees
and will do so in the future.

  I thank you very much for your attention.

                                          SEPTEMBER 18, 1990

        THANK YOU FOR AFFORDING ME TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY
BEFORE YOU TODAY. AT THIS TIME I WOULD ALSO PUBLICLY THANK THE
HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR MEMBERS WHO GAVE THEIR TIME TO REVIEW THE
MATERIAL AND DRAFT SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED FOR THIS
TESTIMONY.

         AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT THE HNBA
HAS TESTIFIED CONCERNING THE NOMINATION OF A U.S. SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE. THE RECORD REFLECTS THAT WE TESTIFIED THAT JUSTICE
KENNEDY WAS QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS A JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME
COURT.

         I AM HERE TO TESTIFY TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE HNBA BOARD OF
DIRECTORS, HAS VOTED TO ENDORSE THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE SOUTER AS
A JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

         AS I HAVE NOTED, "THE HNBA BELIEVES THAT IF CONFIRMED JUDGE
SOUTER WILL APPLY THE LAW FAIRLY AND WILL DEMONSTRATE AN
                                     723

UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF CIVIL RIGHTS RULINGS ON HISPANICS,
WOMEN AND OTHER MINORITIES." HOWEVER, THE HNBA'S ENDORSEMENT IS

°f NOT WITHOUT RESERVATIONS. A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER Of OUR MEMBERSHIP

IS CONCERNED THAT JUDGE SOUTER IS NOT FAMILIAR W I T H THE FASTEST
GROWING POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A* NEW HAMPSHIRE
NATIVE, JUDGE SOUTER, HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO THE ISSUES OF
DISCRIMINATION OF HISPANICS IN SCHOOLS, WORK,AND IN HEALTH CARE, OR
THE ISSUE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF
KNOWLEDGE, HNBA, DOES NOT PRESUME JUDGE SOUTER IS NOT QUALIFIED TO
SERVE AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. THERE IS NO DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN
LACK OF EXPOSURE TO THESE ISSUES AND COMPETENCE TO BE A JUDGE OR A
JUSTICE. INDEED, IF THAT WERE THE STANDARD VBRY FEW PAST AND
PRESENT JUSTICES WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED.

         IN DISCUSSION PRIOR TO THE VOTE TO ENDORSE JUDGE SOUTER, THE
HNBA BOARD EXPRESS CONCERN REGARDING THE JUDGE'S POSITIONS, WHEN HE
WAS THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, REGARDING VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF
1965, IN THE CASE OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. STATE OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE. WE ARE AWARE THAT THE CASE WAS ARGUED ON A PROCEDURAL

POINT AND ULTIMATELY THE HNBA LEADERSHIP REACHED THE SAME
CONCLUSION THAT JUDGE SOUTER POINTED OUT ON HIS TESTIMONY HERE LAST
THURSDAY, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
AND AN ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE VERY DIFFERENT
ROLES. SURELY, WE DO NOT WANT THAT SAME STANDARD HELD FOR A
HISPANIC JUSTICE NOMINEE. THAT IS, THE VIEWS OF ATTORNEYS ARE
ALWAYS REFLECTIVE OF HIS OTHER CLIENTS' VIEWS.

         WE WERE ALSO IMPRESSED WITH JUDGE SOUTER'S REAL LIFE
EXPERIENCES AS HE RELATED THEM TO SENATOR METZENBAUM CONCERNING HIS
EMPATHY WITH THE STUDENT FORCED TO AGONIZE OVER THE ISSUE OF
ABORTION. AS YOU RECALL WHEN HE AS A PROCTOR AT HARVARD LAW
SCHOOL, HE COUNSELED AN ANGUISHED STUDENT ABOUT HIS PREGNANT
GIRLFRIEND. WE ALSO THINK THAT HIS POINT OF NOT REVEALING NAMES
WITH RESPECT FOR THE PRIVACY OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED SHOWED GOOD
JUDGEMENT. THERE ARE QUESTIONS AMONG THE HNBA WHETHER JUDGE SOUTER
HAS ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCES TO ISSUES OF GREAT CONCERN TO WOMEN IN
GENERAL AND HISPANIC WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. THE HNBA BOARD, ON WHICH
HISPANIC WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, HAVE CHOSEN

TO GIVE JUDGE SOUTER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. WE HOPE HE WILL
ADMINISTER JUSTICE FAIRLY, REGARDLESS OF HIS LIMITED LIFE
EXPERIENCES. THE HNBA HAS CHOSEN TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF JUSTICE AS ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

         WITH THE ABOVE IN MIND, AS A MATTER OF LAW, THE HNBA KNOWS
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO NOMINATE THE JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT. WE KNOW THAT SELECTION PROCESS IS SUBJECTIVE. WE
NOTE THAT JUDGE SOUTER WAS SELECTED OVER MANY QUALIFIED HISPANIC
MEN AND WOMEN ATTORNEYS WHOSE CREDENTIALS ARE EQUAL TO AND IN SOME
INSTANCES SURPASS THOSE OF JUDGE SOUTER. WE KNOW THAT IN THE
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ONE PRESIDENT THAT HAS
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO A HISPANIC TO BE PLUCKED OUT OF ANONYMITY
TO SERVE ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. HOWEVER, AS OFFICERS
OF THE COURT, THE HNBA BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLE THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION IS COMPETENT AND HAS AND WILL HAVE THE BEST
INTEREST OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN MIND
AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. WE TRUST THAT JUSTICE SOUTER,
IF CONFIRMED, WILL BE ABLE TO PROJECT THE EXPERIENCES OF SENATOR

RUDMAN'S DISCRIMINATION AS A JEW TO HISPANICS AND OTHER
DISADVANTAGED PEOPLES IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY.

         WHEN JUDGE SOUTER TESTIFIED ON THURSDAY, NOTING THAT "WITH
RESPECT TO SOCIETAL PROBLEMS, NONE IS MORE TRAGIC AND DEMANDING
THAN...DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS OF RACE." WE TRUST THAT HE HOLDS
THAT SAME SENSE OF URGENCY AS IT RELATES TO ALL CIVIL RIGHTS
MATTERS INCLUDING THAT OF NATIONAL ORIGIN IN GENERAL AND HISPANIC
PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. GIVEN THE UNDISPUTED, YET NOT WELL KNOWN,
FACT THAT HISPANICS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, SEX, AGE,
COLOR, RELIGION, OR HANDICAPPED AND GIVEN THE UNDISPUTED FACT THAT
THE HISPANIC DROP OUT RATE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL IN THIS COUNTRY
IS ABOUT 50%.

         THE HNBA IS WELL AWARE THAT RELATIVE TO MANY ATTORNEYS AND
JURISTS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUDGE SOUTER DOES NOT HAVE A BROAD
BASE PROVEN RECORD IN CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES. HOWEVER, THE HNBA IS
A BAR ASSOCIATION, WITH A BASE MUCH BROADER THAT JUST CIVIL RIGHTS,
AND IT IS BASED ON THIS BROAD BASED MEMBERSHIP THAT WE VOTED TO

ENDORSE JUDGE SOUTER, GIVEN THE TOTALITY OF HIS DISTINGUISHED
CAREER AND HIS OUTSTANDING LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. EVEN THOUGH THE HNBA
IS NOT UNANIMOUS IN THEIR ENDORSEMENT OF JUDGE SOUTER, THE MAJORITY
OF THE BOARD DOES SUPPORT HIS ENDORSEMENT.

           IN AN EFFORT FOR THE JUSTICE NOMINEE TO BE AFFORDED A BETTER
OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE HISPANIC LEGAL COMMUNITY IN
PARTICULAR AND THE DIVERSE HISPANIC POPULATION IN GENERAL, WE
FORMALLY INVITE HIM ON THE RECORD TO OUR NEXT HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR
CONVENTION TO BE HELD IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, NEXT FALL. FOR THE
RECORD, JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNER, ADDRESSED THE HNBA IN 1983, IN
WASHINGTON, D.C., AND JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY ADDRESSED THE HNBA IN
1988 IN ALBUQUERQUE. THIS REQUEST SHOULD BE TAKEN EVEN MORE
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE, UNLIKE JUSTICE O'CONNER OR JUSTICE KENNEDY, FROM
ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA RESPECTIVELY BOTH WITH SIZABLE HISPANIC
POPULATIONS, JUDGE SOUTER DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, BACKGROUND
OR HISTORY OF THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. SUCH LACK OF KNOWLEDGE DOES
NOT MAKE HIM UNACCEPTABLE AS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE; HOWEVER, IN
THE MEANTIME WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT JUDGE SOUTER READ THE CASE OF

         THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. WE HOPE THE
NEXT TIME THAT WE ARE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THAT WE
WILL BE TESTIFYING TO ENDORSE THE FIRST HISPANIC SUPREME COURT

                                         729

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Now, although we have questions, we can submit them to you in
writing. I know you have a very difficult scheduling problem, so as
far as the Chair is concerned, you are excused or you can stay. It is
totally up to you.
   Mr. Ruiz. I will stay, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. All right.
   Mr. Dunfey, how are you?
   Mr. DUNFEY. I am fine, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. It is good to see you.
   Mr. DUNFEY. It is nice to see you again.
   The CHAIRMAN. Welcome and please proceed with whatever testi-
mony you would like to give.

                   STATEMENT OF WILLIAM L. DUNFEY

   Mr. DUNFEY. Thank you, Senator.
   The most recent census will probably reveal that we have slight-
ly over 1 million in the State of New Hampshire. However, if you
live in the Granite State and become involved in local or State af-
fairs, you more often think of it as a small community, wherein at
one time or another you meet just about every man and woman
who is active in community affairs.
   I am not an attorney. My profession has been the hotel business,
with New Hampshire and New England forming the base for what
has developed into an international hotel company. In the process
of trying to repay New Hampshire for the many good things that it
has provided me and my family, I have accepted service on various
organizations devoted to maintaining and improving the quality of
life in my State.

   It was in 1980 that I was asked to serve on the board of overseers
of the Dartmouth Medical School. In 1981, Judge David Souter was
also appointed a member of the board of overseers at Dartmouth.
Our service on the board overlapped about 5 years, 1981-86.

   As a former Democratic State chairman and party activist, I was
aware that David Souter was an appointee of Republican State offi-
cials to positions in the attorney general's office and the judiciary.

   In our work together, David Souter won my complete respect,
just as his distinguished career as a judge has won the respect of
the people of New Hampshire, whatever their political and philo-
sophical views.

  Judge Souter brings the unusual combination of serious atten-
tion to his responsibilities, along with individual accountability for
one's actions.

   This approach is not unique to New Hampshire or New England.
It is a trait that is fundamental to the fairness of the American
system of justice that has produced outstanding members of the Su-
preme Court.

  Judge Souter's reputation for guarding his privacy and devoting
his personal time to activities that physically and mentally re-
charge his batteries should provide a good perspective for the many
challenges that the Supreme Court will face in the 1990's.
                                              730

   In New Hampshire, almost without exception, we are very proud
of the nomination of Judge Souter, and I am especially honored to
have been asked to support and endorse that nomination.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Dunfey.
  Mr. Martin.

                     STATEMENT OF R. EDEN MARTIN

  Mr. MARTIN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  I am here primarily as a character witness. I must say at the
outset that I am probably unable to be strictly neutral about it.
David Souter is a close personal friend of mine and has been for
many years.
  I got to know David Souter when I was in law school. We were
proctors together at Harvard College. We were next door neighbors
in a dormitory for 2 years. It was his second and third year in law
school and my first and second, and we became very close personal
friends at that time, and I feel that I knew him very well then, and
I have continued to be a friend of his over the years.
  I think the reason I am here is because that appeared in the Chi-
cago Tribune on August 21, 1990. It was a commentary on the
human quality of David Souter. I believe the committee has been
provided with copies, and I do not have any separate written state-
ment.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct, we do.
  Mr. MARTIN. I wrote that article, because it seemed to me that
the initial news commentaries that were coming out about David
Souter were somewhat misleading. They were accurate in the sense
that they reflected his intelligence, but they suggested that he was
an excessively bookish individual, somewhat antisocial, somewhat
monkish, somewhat ascetic, and not very much fun, or at least
some of the articles suggested that, and it seemed to me that that
gave quite an unfair and misleading portrait of the man and I
wanted to set it straight, which was the reason that I wrote the ar-
ticle.

  As I indicated there, he is sociable, he is sensitive to the feelings
and concerns of others. I quoted one of the Harvard deans who in-
dicated that he showed compassion and understanding in dealing
with the freshmen who were his charges at Harvard, and I have
submitted the article and I would be happy to answer any ques-
tions that you have.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. The article will also be
placed in the record.

    Because he is not a well-known public figure, reporters,

9   have scrambled the past several weeks to find people '*,
    who knew him and could help answer that question.' '','

    In so scrambling, they discovered many students in the

    judge's law school class who do not remember him.

    together at Harvard College for two yean, from 1964-

    counseling, and make sure that college rules were

    law student proctors did not become particularly well

    known to their law school classmates.

    The news articles about Judge Souter have been

    generally accurate except for a tendency to paint him

I   as somewhat bookish and antisocial. That picture            his freshman advisees had problems and a relaxed way        irrelevant, but it ranked pretty low on his personal

  The CHAIRMAN. Let us move now to Judge Hall. Welcome, it is
kind of you to come.

               STATEMENT OF JUDGE SOPHIA H. HALL
  Judge HALL. I am delighted to be here.
  My name is Sophia H. Hall, and I am a judge of the Circuit
Court of Cook County, IL, and I have an idea of how you might be
feeling after this long trial today.
  The CHAIRMAN. I bet you know better than any of us right now.
  Judge HALL. I am the president of the National Association of
Women Judges. We are a group of almost 1,000 men and women
and we are judges of the State courts as well as the Federal courts.
  One of our projects is the promotion of gender fairness in the ad-
ministration of the courts, and one of the programs we have is the
National Judicial Education Program to promote equality for men
and women in the courts. These programs enable judges to under-
stand how stereotypes and biases about the role of women and men
affect factfinding, decisionmaking, as well as courtroom interac-
tion.
  The educational programs are necessary, because socially in-
grained norms, like women should be at home with the children
while the men go to war, may prevent judges from giving credence
to contrary evidence in particular cases. The need for these pro-
grams has been researched by over 30 State-sponsored gender bias
task forces around the country. Over 10 of those task forces have
reported so far, and they have reported that gender bias does exist
in our court systems.
  We believe that this committee needs to know whether Judge
David Souter is pledged to basic concepts of fairness, and we have
two reasons for this concern. One is his expressed original intent
philosophy, which was indicated in a dissent to one of the interpre-
tations of the New Hampshire constitution, and the other is the
comments of a close friend of his, Dr. Melvin Levin, another
Rhodes Scholar, who stated that he believed that Judge Souter is
in the 18th century mold.
  These indicators raise concerns, because learned people know
that when the U.S. Constitution was written in the 1780's, their
original intent apparently was to provide constitutional protections
for white males only; women and blacks were under the law, sepa-
rate and unequal, and that separate and unequal status has contin-
ued under Supreme Court case law until the 1970's, when Reed v.
Reed was decided. In that case, the Supreme Court utilized the
14th amendment, adopted more than 100 years earlier, to strike
down an Idaho law. The Idaho law gave an automatic preference to
men in appointments as administrators of estates.
  The Reed case was a tremendous breakthrough for guaranteeing
the rights of women under the U.S. Constitution, and that Court's
decision was consistent with the changed role of women in today's
society.
  I think you have asked questions already about what Judge
Souter thinks of the reasoning in the Reed case and whether or not
he thinks that this is an original intent case. I think you probably
have asked questions about what Judge Souter thinks of the rea-
                                             733

soning in subsequent cases which expanded the rights of women
under the U.S. Constitution.

  You need to examine Judge Souter's testimony and his record to
determine whether he harbors 18th century biases as to the proper
role for men and women in present day society. We firmly believe
this is a crucial area for you to explore.

  In addition, this committee must determine Judge Souter's judi-
cial philosophy; how does he reconcile his concepts of stare decisis
with his original intent thesis; as a conservative, what does he
think of the judicial activism of today's Supreme Court.

  You must determine from his testimony and his record whether
Judge Souter is an 18th century judge or, on the contrary, is a
qualified candidate to resolve the 20th century problems facing the
Supreme Court.

  The National Association of Women Judges appreciates this op-
portunity to speak to you. We come here neither to speak for Judge
Souter nor against him. We, however, urge a searching inquiry into
his testimony and his record, so you all can know Judge Souter's
views of basic concepts of fairness and, thus, make a reasoned deci-
sion on whether he should be confirmed as an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States.

  Thank you.

National Association of Women Judges

       NEMORAKDOM

TOi    Senator Joseph It. Olden, J r .
FROM:  Ohair, United States Senate Judiciary Committee
RE:    Judo* Sophia H. Rail
DATE:  President, National Association of Woman Judges

       Judge David Souter

       September 2S, 1990

        At your request, I have reviewed the excerpts of Judge
Souter'· testimony which you have provided. I do not find a
significant difference between his original meaning doctrine and
the usual original intent proceae of analysis. Accordingly, X
find no reason to change the NAWJ's statement of concern.

        In In Re Estate of Dlonne. Judge Souter'· dissent
demonstrates his view that you determine the f ranters'
understanding of constitutional language by looking at the
evidence of the thinking at the time the language wae adopted.
Judge Souter1e statement that the decision in Brown v. Board of
Education Is consistent with hie doctrine of original meaning, as
exemplified in Dlonne, is not supported by hia testimony because
in discueelng Brown he does not use the same process of analysis
he used in Dionne. He uses a different analysis which I call the
doctrine of "previously Ignored evidence."

        Judge Souter attempts to distance himself from conventional
views of the original intent doctrine by narrowly defining the
doctrine.

                 "I do not believe that the appropriate criterion
                 of constitutional meaning is this sense of

S«of.tarl.t · National Came' for Stala Cour-6 · 300 Nan/ptrt Avinut · 'MWimtiwrs V.rgna 211S7-8798 · (B04> 253-2000
                                736

                 original intent< that you may never apply a
                 provision to any aubjact axeapt the subject
                 specifically intended by tha paopla who adopted
                 it. I euppoae tha moat apeetaoular example of tha
                 significance of thla ia tha caaa of grown v. Board
                 of Education." 9/13 p. 214

                 "... whan I apeak of original intent ..., I am
                 talking particularly about that view that tha
                 meaning of the proviaion or the application of tha
                 provlaion ahould somehow be confined to those
                 apeciflc inetancea or problem* which were in the
                 minds of thoee who adopted or ratified the
                 provielon. ...." 9/17 p. 135

        He contrasts hia doctrine of original meaning by saying that

it is not oonfinsd to determining instances or problems in the

minds of the framera.

                 "What we are looking for then, when we look for
                 its original meaning is the principle that waa
                 intended to be applied, and if that principle is
                 broad enough to apply to school desegregation, as
                 It clearly waa, then that was an appropriate
                 application for it and Brown was undoubtsdly
                 correctly decided." 9/13 p. 216

                 "He have been placed upon courts to Impose the
                 will that liee behind the meaning of thoee who
                 framed and by their adoption intended to impose
                 the law and the constitutional law of this country
                 upon us all." 9/14 p. 7

        Judge Souter explained his doctrine of original meaning by

referring to his analysis in hia dissent in Dionne. In that case,

ths New Hampshire Supreme Court was applying a phrase in its

constitution which provided that "[e]very subject of this state

is entitled... to obtain right and justice freely without being

obligated to purchase it....11 In his dissent Judge Souter stated

his original meaning doctrine in somewhat different terms than he

ueee now. "The court's interpretive task ie therefore to

determine the meaning of the article 14 language as It waa
                               737

understood whsn ths framars proposed It and ths people ratified
It as part of the original constitutional text...." 518 A.2d at
181.

         In the opinion, he atated that the "... [ejvldence of that
understanding comes from two eoureee. The first la the body of
scholarly and judicial commentary on the meaning of the clause of
the Magna Oarta of 1215...." from which the New Hampshire
constitutional language was derived. 618 A.2d at 181 The eecond
eouroe was the history of New Kampehire statutes" "... as a
record of what New Hampshire Judges and legislators regarded as
consistent with English liberties during the early period of our
history, and as conslatsnt with the State Conatitutlon after
1784." S18 A.2d at 182 Judge Souter, based on this evidence of
the framers1 understanding, found that "...the people who framed
and adopted article 14 meant principally to guard against bribsry
of ths sort that had corrupted the early medieval judiciary." 018
A.2d at 183-184

         In his testimony. Judge Souter described his original
meaning analytical proceee. He said that you flret must look at
the text. 9/14 p. 60 He did not characterize the next step, but,
from the process he used in Dlonne. the second step is to look at
the evidence of the understanding of the framers at the time they
adopted It. In Dlonne, he found that evidence in scholarly and
judicial commentary of the time and In the conduct of legislators
and Judges.

        Judge Souter, however, does not use thle analytical process
when he explained how the decision in Brown v. Board of Education

                                                    - 3 -
         738

Is consistent with his original meaning method of analysis. Hs
did stats that first you look at ths text of the equal protsctlon
clause. It la broad and not 11mltad to raes. 9/14 p. 60 The next
stsp he should have testiflsd to, pursuant to his Dlonne process,
would be to find the framers1 understanding when they used the
language, by looking at the evidence of the thinking of the times
when the Fourteenth Amendment was paaeed or when Pleesv v.
Ferguson was decided 30 years later.

        Instead, Judge Souter discusses a diffsrent analytical
process which I call the doctrine of "previously Ignored
evidence."

        "The majority who decide Plessv v. Ferguson
in 1896 accepted as a matter of fact that in the
context in which they were applying the Fourteenth
Amendment there could be separateneee and
equality. Whatever else we may sse in Brown v.
poard. there is one thing that we see very clearly
and that is that the Court was saying you may no
longar in applying this separate but equal
doctrine, ignore the evidence of non-tangible
effects. When you accept that evidence, then you
see that you cannot have separateness and
equality.

In 1954 they saw something they did not see

in 1896  they saw an application for a

principle which was not seen in 1896, and they saw

the factual impossibility of applying the terms of
1696 in 1954.

        I would like to think, and I do believe, that
the principle of equal protection waa there and
that in the time intervening we have gotten better
at seeing what is before our noses." 9/17 p.
196-197 (Emphasis supplied)

        In this testimony, therefore. Judge Souter proposes to
disregard what the framers "accepted as a matter of fact" at the
time, and use evidence that was presumably Ignored by the

         - 4-

rather than, aa hara, hypotheaise that thinking by supplying
avldanoa not than oonaldarad. If ha had uaad his prpvm analysis

        In conclusion, Judga Soutar'a original naanlng doctrine aa

tha meaning of language uaed at the time. Hla explanation of why
tha Brown dacialon ia consistent with tha Dlonna caaa is not

tha NAWJ finds hla analytical procaaa causa for concern, and,
particularly so, in light of hia ahlft in analysis in diacuasing

          before tha Committee.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I want to thank you for being here. By
the way, I want to thank you for your organization. It has had an
impact and a growing impact on hopefully sensitizing--I was going
to say us all, but I would like to see in the choice of all nominees to
the Court, I would like to see the administration sensitized a little
bit more. I really mean it, I think your organization is making a
very positive impact and it will only grow.

   Thank you for being here.
   Let me go to Ms. Coleman and then what we will do is we will go
to questions.

                      STATEMENT OF DORIS COLEMAN

   Ms. COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
am honored to be a part of this historic event. I think any time we
discuss an appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, it is historic,
and this man is going to play an important part in all of our lives.

   I am here as president of California Women Lawyers, the largest
women's bar association in the world. With 23,000 women lawyers,
judges, and law professors in California, our number is nearly as
great as the population in the Capital of New Hampshire, but it is,
I am certain, growing at a faster rate.

  This comparison is meant to emphasize the size and diversity of
California Women Lawyers. We are a nonpartisan organization,
with members who are bright, educated, and articulate. Our mem-
bers and affiliates do not agree on all issues, but we do not knee
jerk any issue, but I do want to tell you that there are some issues
that we have clear stated positions on. My purpose in being here
today is to share some of those positions with you.

  We believe that a woman's right to make decisions about her
own body and her life in connection with reproductive rights is a
fundamental constitutional right, and the most rigid scrutiny test
must be applied when that right is in jeopardy. We believe in
choice. We believe choice is a fundamental right guaranteed by the
Constitution. If that right is taken away, it will be the first time in
history that a fundamental right, once recognized, has been taken
away. We have always gone forward, never back.

   As we approach the 21st century, the message is still clear that
it is OK to discriminate against women. Before adjourning for its
summer session, the House of Representatives passed a version of
the Civil Rights Act of 1990 that placed a cap on damages that can
be awarded to women in cases of sex discrimination, without plac-
ing a similar cap on discrimination actions brought based on race.
That sends a powerful message and it is the wrong message.

   Last March, the draft of California's 3-year study of gender bias
in the courts was released. The study produced a massive report.
Even those who expected to find some bias, were surprised by its
pervasiveness. Chief Justice Lucas of California said at the first
hearing in Los Angeles that he hoped that our State, with its repu-
tation for progressive and fair social attitudes, would be different.
But it did not turn out that way. California, like the rest of the
Nation, has strange notions about women. We found that the dis-
crimination experienced by women in California was the same dis-
crimination experienced by women throughout the Nation.
                             741

The study not only confirmed the existence of sex discrimination

in the judicial system, but it concluded that substantial ameliora-

tion of the problem of gender-biased conduct in the courtroom

would be accomplished, if more women were appointed to the judi-

cial offices. I suspect that substantial amelioration to many prob-

lems in the workplace would be accomplished by more women in

leadership and policymaking positions.

There is no such thing as being almost equal; the bubble is either

in the middle or the floor is not level. No one likes quotas and few

believe they are necessary, but there is a need for some mechanism

to correct the problem, and the problem is reflected by numbers. Of

your Judiciary Committee of 14, none are women; the Senate is 98

percent male; women constitute a bare 5 to 10 percent of America's

total judiciary, depending upon the criteria used for counting;

words and phrases such as "glass ceiling, revolving doors" and

"mommy track" have evolved to describe the discrimination that

women find in the workplace. The next Supreme Court Justice

must recognize a long established discrimination against women

and the need for mechanisms to correct these injustices.

I would like to share a list of concerns which were extracted

from letters exchanged between women lawyers between 1880 and

1900. This is the turn of the last century. They were:

First, the power disadvantage of women in relation to men with

whom they associated and competed; second, the balancing of

heavy domestic responsibilities for women, in addition to their

demand professional work; third, the concern about the condition

and quality of life for women; and, fourth, the discrimination

which checked their hopes for professional security and advance-

ment--almost 100 years ago.

When California Women Lawyers was formed in 1975, almost

100 years after these problems were noted by other women law-

yers, our goals echoed that list. If we are indeed making progress,

we are traveling at an exceedingly slow pace.

Finally, I want to ask the committee, in reaching its decision,

and each of you individually, to make sure that you are convinced

that Judge Souter is enlightened and sensitive to women's issues,

and I ask that you keep women's issues foremost in your minds.

We are depending on you.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

I am going to yield to my colleague, who has one question for all

of you, and then I will have some questions.

Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

First, I have a question for you gentlemen, Mr. Martin, Mr.

Dunfey, and Mr. Ruiz. Is it your opinion that Judge Souter has the

competency, the dedication, the courage and the integrity and the

fairness to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the Untied States?

We will start with you, Mr. Martin.

Mr. MARTIN. I certainly do.

Senator THURMOND. Mr. Dunfey.

Mr. DUNFEY. My answer is unequivocally yes.

Senator THURMOND. Mr. Ruiz.                                  /

Mr. Ruiz. Our board review the qualifications of          /

Senator THURMOND. I cannot hear you.                      /
                                               742

  Mr. Ruiz. When the board reviewed the qualifications of the
nominee, it was our determination that he did have the qualifica-
tions, the competence, and the judicial temperament to hold the
office. Our concerns, as I expressed them to you, went to other mat-
ters and that had to do with his exposure to some of the issues that
concern our organization, which in a sense are not too dissimilar
from other views that you have heard from the other end of the
table.

  The CHAIRMAN. Your organization has endorsed
  Mr. Ruiz. Yes, we have.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. But on a close vote, as you charac-
terized it.
  Mr. Ruiz. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have endorsed, by a close vote.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, Judge Hall and Judge Coleman, I un-
derstand you both may have some question about the fairness of
the judge, I believe you raised some question like that. Now, I pre-
sume you have no question about the judge's integrity or judicial
temperament, then, or professional qualifications?
  Judge HALL. Since I only know what I have read in the newspa-
pers, so far they have not seemed to indicate any problem with
that, and of course what I have heard during the hearing today.
  Senator THURMOND. Of course, as a matter of fairness, the com-
mittee will have to act on that, as well as other questions involved.
  Judge Coleman, did you want to make any statement on that?
  Ms. COLEMAN. NO, I do not, Senator Thurmond. I am not a judge.
I am sitting next to the judge. I am the president of California
Women Lawyers, and it is in that capacity that I am here today.
  From what I have read, I would recognize that Judge Souter is
probably a constitutional scholar.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, you look like a judge, anyway. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Ms. COLEMAN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. We thank all of you witnesses for coming
and we appreciate your presentations. Thank you very much.
  Judge HALL. Thank you.
  Ms. COLEMAN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry to keep you so long and I apologize to
everyone, including those who expected to be on the 7 o'clock train,
if they are watching. I apologize to them, as well, but this is very
important and your testimony, as far as I am concerned is very im-
portant.
  Let me ask a few questions here, if I may, and I will not keep
you long, I promise. Mr. Ruiz, what is the most prominent reason
given by those in your organization who voted against supporting
Judge Souter becoming Justice Souter?
  Mr. Ruiz. The most frequently expressed concern was, one that is
not too unfamiliar to the members of this committee, in that three
was very little information about what he would do as a member of
the U.S. Supreme Court and what he would do vis-a-vis civil rights
matters and issues of particular concern to the Hispanic members
of our organization.
                                               743

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, was your vote taken before or after or
during the time the Judge was testifying?

  Mr. Ruiz. The vote was taken before the testimony began.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Now, Judge Hall, your concern was the same as mine, I guess, if
you watched any of the hearings, and I spent most of my time or at
least half of my time questioning the judge, I think extensively, I
would characterize it as extensively, on his interpretivist view of
the Constitution and the notion of original intention, and he very
clearly stated and very clearly distinguished himself from--I am
characterizing this now--the Ed Meeses and the Judge Borks of the
world--he did not use either of those phrases, but they are the
ones most recently associated with the notion of original intent, at
least before this committee.
  He said no, I look at original meaning, which is different than
intent. He said, if I am accurately characterizing him, he said origi-
nal intent means just what you said, Judge Hall, clearly when they
wrote the Constitution, it was written not to encompass suffrage or
for all citizens, it acknowledged the existence of slavery, et cetera,
and so on.
  He said if you go back and look at the fifth amendment and read
due process in terms of what the intent was at the outset, it would
make it very difficult to make the case that there is any substan-
tive due process element; or the 14th amendment, clearly it was
written with blacks in mind in the post-Civil War era, and not
women, but he said they enshrined principles there; and, in the
case of the 14th amendment and women, an interest obviously to
which you have testified, he said the equal protection clause meant
what it said, the principle was, the principle meaning was that
equal protection meant to encompass all human beings.
  Therefore, his interpretivist view is fundamentally different than
the interpretivist view of others like Judge Bork, for example. Did
you have an opportunity to hear any of that testimony?
  Judge HALL. NO, I did not, and I find it a very interesting distinc-
tion. The language that he used in his opinion, that dissenting
opinion, the Court's interpretive task is to determine the meaning
of constitutional language as it was understood when the Framers
proposed it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, and he says meaning and he goes to great
lengths to make a distinction between meaning and intent.
  I would appreciate it, and I am being very serious when I say
this, I do not want to make work for you, but I would appreciate it
if our staff were to gather for you immediately those exchanges
that took place on this issue, if we could get them to you immedi-
ately--we will not be voting on the judge for probably 6, 7, 8 days
in committee--if you would have a chance to look at it and to tell
us whether or not it goes toward answering the question you ask us
to answer, and that is you basically said, "Biden, look at this close-
ly, unless you are convinced this guy is sensitized to the concerns,
needs and constitutional rights of women, then don't vote for it," I
think that is your saying.
  Judge HALL. Yes.
                                               744

  The CHAIRMAN. If you think he is not sensitive, don't vote for
him; if you think he is, then vote for him, is that the sense of what
you are saying?

  Judge HALL. I would also like to hear what he has to say about
Brown v. Board of Education, but the Supreme Court's interpreta-
tion of what that meant changed from 1896, when Plessy v. Fergu-
son was decided, to 1954 when Brown v. Board

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are very sharp.
  Judge HALL [continuing]. So when you talk about meaning, it
does have a contextual context of the times.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, he argues and he goes to great lengths to
distinguish that case and he says that, clearly--well, I will not
characterize what he says, I will let you read that.
  Judge HALL. I would be delighted to review the testimony and I
will get back to you.
  The CHAIRMAN. But there is a good deal of testimony on that pre-
cise point and I would be interested to hear your view.
  Now, Ms. Coleman, you indicated what your concerns are, the
concerns of the organization.
  Ms. COLEMAN. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU indicated what our concerns should be, as a
committee. You have not drawn a conclusion, I assume, from what
you have heard to either allay your fears or reinforce your con-
cerns. Is that correct? Is that a fair statement?
  Ms. COLEMAN. Mr. Biden or Senator Biden, I think it
  The CHAIRMAN. Joe is fine, it does not matter. At this hour, you
can call me anything. [Laughter.]
  Ms. COLEMAN. I think that my organization is not willing to at
this point take a position, simply because our members are mem-
bers of other organizations that have spoken before you today. We
have members how belong to NOW, we have members who belong
to the ABA, and so from that standpoint I am not going to take a
position.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Ms. COLEMAN. However, I would like to say that I would be far
more comfortable with Judge Souter, if I saw his association with
people who are also known to be liberal, as well as those who are
merely known to be conservative.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you are sitting at the table with--I hope
you do not mind the characterization, Mr. Dunfey, as one who has
characterized in varying degrees of liberal, I have never heard Mr.
Dunfey characterized as anything but a liberal, and if you know
New Hampshire Democratic politics, the assertion is the reason
why "we never win is because we are too liberal," and you are sit-
ting at the table with one with whom he associated, who is ex-
tremely liberal.

  Earlier today, there were two very liberal members, present- and
past-president of the Bar Association of New Hampshire, who no
one has characterized as anything but liberal. So, in New Hamp-
shire, I must acknowledge--Mr. Dunfey, have I mischaracterized
you?

  Mr. DUNFEY. NO; you are very accurate and I think, to take it a
step further, in addition to being a Democratic Party State chair-
man and supporting Judge Souter, I have also been a strong sup-
                                         745

porter of Planned Parenthood and its aims and a woman's right to
choice. Having said all of that, from my acquaintance with David
Souter, as a layman, not as an attorney, I would look to him to be
a very fairminded jurist on these issues, despite the fact that I
have been on the opposite side of the fence.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, when you say "opposite side of the fence,"
do you assume

  Mr. DUNFEY. I am talking politically.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you mean opposite side of the fence political-
ly, or do you mean opposite side of the fence on those issues that
you raised?
  Mr. DUNFEY. NO; on those issues that I raised, I just wanted to at
least explain my own personal feel in support of Planned Parent-
hood and, having said that and having watched Judge Souter per-
form in New Hampshire, I still am a strong supporter for this nom-
ination.

  The CHAIRMAN. The reason why I raise that, Ms. Coleman, is
that one of the things that we are all looking--I should not say all,
I will speak only for me--I am looking to determine whether or not
Judge Souter has met an overall test of having a judicial philoso-
phy that would encompass and embrace the great traditions of the
past, which have acknowledged unenumerated rights, looked
toward the expansion of, not the diminishment of those rights, and
one that clearly understands that, in my view, the only reasonable
reading of the Constitution is one that embraces women in the
same way it does men.

  I have been searching not make that judgment. I have not made
it yet. There are a number of things that lead me to believe, not
the least of which is Mr. Dunfey is here. As a matter of fact, when
I was seeking another job, I think I was probably too conservative
for Mr. Dunfey, if I remember correctly. He liked a fellow from
Massachusetts a little better, if I remember correctly.

  Mr. DUNFEY. NO; it was Governor Bruce Babbitt.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was Babbitt. I knew it was not me, I remem-
ber that much, which reinforced your good judgment. [Laughter.]
  Having said that, it is a very difficult task and that is why I am
probing each of you in ways that do not necessarily precisely to
whether or not you know exactly what the judge thinks or does not
think. It means a great deal to me, and I mean this sincerely, that
you are here, Ms. Coleman, representing 23,000 women lawyers, ju-
rists and professors who obviously have concerns.
  Ms. COLEMAN. Yes, they do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge Hall, you have expressed your view well,
and, again, I was not being solicitous when I said I would like very
much for you to look at the testimony, and I understand why you
have not had an opportunity to do that at this point.
  As you indicated, Mr. Martin, my failure to ask you questions
does not go to my lack of interest in your, it just goes to the fact
that the one thing that I am certain of, that anyone with whom
David Souter has been a friend or an acquaintance, he has treated
them well and he has acted properly.
  Mr. MARTIN. Senator, may I make one very brief comment?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.
                                               746

  Mr. MARTIN. This may, of course, not be determinative, but it
strikes me as very interesting. I have listened to the testimony
each day and I have listened to it all day today. I have read news-
paper accounts that I was able to find, where friends of his or
people who know him have expressed their views about him.

  Of course, there are organizations that are for him and there are
organizations that are against him, but one thing that strikes me
as striking and deserving of at least some weight is that, as far as I
know, no one has come forward and expressed a view in the news-
papers or to commentators or come before this committee who
knows him who is not for him, and that is true, whether it is men
or women, lawyers or nonlawyers, Democrats or Republicans. I be-
lieve it is a true statement that everyone who knows him, who
knew him earlier or has known him over his career as a practicing
attorney or as a judge, has endorsed him and expressed their sup-
port for him.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank you all very, very much for your
testimony. Some of you have made a long trip to give it, but it is
important and we appreciate your view of your responsibility as
conscientious citizens to do it, and I thank you very, very much.

  The hearing is adjourned.
  [Whereupon, at 7:21 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to recon-
vene on Wednesday, September 19, 1990, at 10 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO BE AS-
  SOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
  OF THE UNITED STATES

                    WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1990

                                                                     U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                          Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:19 a.m., in room
216, Senate Hart Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chair-
man of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, DeConcini, Leahy, Heflin,
Simon, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, and Humphrey.
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will please come to order.
  Let me again apologize for our late start. Most of us on this
panel, all on this panel, have essentially, for the last 5 or 6 or, in
some cases, 7 legislative days devoted, as we should, somewhere in
excess of 14 or 15 hours a day of doing nothing but this. Quite
frankly, our other legislative responsibilities are catching up with
us a little bit.
  If Senator Kennedy is able to arrive in time or if Senator Heflin
is going to be able to stay, I, at 10:30, am supposed to--I am part of
a leadership group on the Democratic side meeting to determine
what position should be taken relative to the Saudi arms sale, the
$20 billion sale. I will only be in the leader's office for 45 minutes
or so, but if I am able to, I should be there. I have been requested
by the leadership to be there.
  I want to say to the witnesses, I will hear this panel in all proba-
bility; but to the witnesses who would come after or any time
during the day that I may be in and out on that issue, it is not for
a lack of interest. I expect I will be here for 90 percent of all the
testimony today.
  I know that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee--han-
dling one of the most significant and, from a cost standpoint, one of
the most seriously looked at, by him, pieces of legislation we will
handle this year--is in what we call, for the public, a markup.
That means the House of Representatives has passed a farm bill;
the Senate has passed a farm bill. Now they are meeting to recon-
cile the differences in a multibillion dollar bill. The leader of that
group--and his responsibility required him to be there--is the Sen-
ator from Vermont.
  Let me yield to him for just a moment because he would like to
make a brief comment about that.

                                                        (747)
                                               748

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the courtesy. As the
Chair knows, I was able to be here by--as we all did--clearing the
schedule for virtually every bit of Judge Souter's testimony. I have
watched from tapes and from the rebroadcast by C-SPAN and
others the testimony and powerful statements of Ms. Michelman,
Ms. Wattleton, Ms. Yard, Ms. Smeal, Mr. Rauh and others--I don't
mean to leave anybody out of this--my former colleague from my
prosecutor's days, Mr. Diamond, and the other attorneys general,
former attorneys general who have testified.

  I have had a chance to watch, but I am disappointed I have not
been able to be here and ask questions as those have gone along.
But it is necessary, if we are going to get the 5-year farm bill out,
to go back to it, and that is taking an extraordinary amount of my
time. I must admit, Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to be bor-
rowing people like Senator Heflin and others for help on that at
different times. But the Chair has been extremely gracious in
making sure that we have been fitted in and that questions some of
us have had have been asked whether we have been here or not. I
appreciate that, and I would just apologize for not being here for
every minute of it.

  The CHAIRMAN. TO state the obvious--then we will move on--the
same situation pertains for Senators Hatch and Simpson and
Grassley and others of us on this committee who have other com-
mittee responsibilities. But I suspect I will be able to be here for
the vast bulk of it, enough of it. I look at the witness table, and
they are looking at me like what in the heck do you have to ex-
plain all that for, Biden. There is a real easy reason for having to
explain it: To make sure that no one on this panel or any other
panel feels they are being slighted. Second, to make clear to our
constituents at home that it is not that we are not paying atten-
tion, but that there are some other things to do. That is the selfish
side of the explanation.

  With that, let's begin today's hearing with a very distinguished
panel. Our first member of the panel is Wesley Williams, a partner
in the very prestigious Washington law firm of Covington and
Burling, and it is well beyond Washington, I might add; and Robert
L. Beck, immediate past chairman of the board of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, I might add an organization with whom I have
worked very closely, and I also might add that I think you have
done more to save lives in this country in the last several years
than any single organization doing just about anything because of
the national consciousness that you have pricked. I compliment
you very, very much on your work. Then we have Robert L. Barr,
Jr., president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, Inc.; and a
witness who is to be here--and we expect will be here but is not at
the moment--Anne Neamon, national coordinator for Citizens and
Country.

  Now let us begin. If you could attempt to confine your state-
ments to 5 minutes, we would appreciate it a great deal. We will
start with you, Mr. Williams. Having argued appellate cases, you
can probably get it down to 5 minutes.

PANEL CONSISTING OF WESLEY S. WILLIAMS, JR., COVINGTON &
  BURLING, WASHINGTON, DC; ROBERT L. BECK, IMMEDIATE
  PAST CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFI-
  CER, MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING; AND ROBERT L.
  BARR, JR., PRESIDENT, SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION,
  INC.

               STATEMENT OF WESLEY S. WILLIAMS, JR.

  Mr. WILLIAMS. I will try to, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, mem-
bers of the committee, with your permission, I would like to submit
my full statement in writing and just summarize my remarks.

  The CHAIRMAN. Your entire statement will be put in the record
as if read.

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you. My name is Wesley Williams, Jr., and
I am happy to have this opportunity to appear before you today to
serve as a character witness. This is a very personal statement for
your nominee, Judge David Souter, whom I have known for some-
where between 25 and 30 years. I want to emphasize that I am tes-
tifying on my own personal behalf, and my remarks do not neces-
sarily reflect the views of any organization or any other group with
which I may be associated.

  Since my remarks are directed to the question having to do with
the quality of the individual that the nominee represents, in my
written remarks I detailed at some length certain relevant back-
ground of mine which might seem at first blush irrelevant, but I
am sure the lawyers among you will realize and are familiar with
the fact that character statements and reputation testimony of this
sort is usually focused more on the person who is making the state-
ment than on the fine points of what is said. It is the larger conclu-
sions that I have for you, and I hope that I will provide you a basis
for agreeing with them.

   As you will see in my remarks, I have detailed the fact that I am
a lawyer in private practice here. I am celebrating my 20th anni-
versary with the firm of Covington & Burling, at which I have been
a partner for 15 years. The fact that I have held leadership posi-
tions throughout the 1970's and 1980's in a variety of legal, busi-
ness, and charitable activities encompassing everything from the
D.C. bar, social welfare agencies, educational institutions, the
church, civil rights organizations, and so forth and so on. The fact
that, like David Souter, I am a graduate of Harvard College and
Harvard Law School, where the judge and I overlapped for 2 years
in college and 2 years in law school, so we really do go back a long,
long way. And, most importantly, as freshmen proctors--that is to
say, as resident counselors and faculty advisers to freshmen at
Harvard when we were law students--I must have had lunch or
dinner with David Souter a half a dozen times a week for a couple
of years. I literally saw him day in and day out for a long, long
period of time.

   I think it is significant that the judge and I crossed paths at a
time when he was mature enough to afford his friends a glimpse of
the person that he was and would remain, which was also a stage
marked by optimal candor, a stage when none of us was in the
public life.
                                             750

  With that premise--and I hope I have given you some basis, if
not here then certainly in the written remarks, to conclude that I
can speak credibly to the judge's professional and humane dimen-
sions--I have these conclusions: In my experience, Judge Souter is
every bit the fine human being that his advocates have portrayed
him to be. He, of course, has a keen sense of privacy of the sort
that we associate with small-town and rural America coast to
coast. He has a refined sense of propriety and a sense of the time
and place for particular conduct which, to my thinking, seems alto-
gether appropriate for a judge.

  He is here, as he should be--and I have watched the tapes--re-
spectful and even demure. But in appropriate settings Judge
Souter, like any other human being, can display as much zest as
you or I for the play of ideas, for good humor, for good, honest fun,
which is to say for life itself. In fact, I hope this will not embarrass
him, the judge's reputation is of being something of a master of the
bon mot. I have listened to many, many dinner table conversations
with him, participated in them, and he is a master at that leisure
time art of the clever rejoinder.

  I say that because the rather demure image that you have here
might convince some that we are perhaps dealing with some sort of
legal automaton. He is not that at all. This is a full-blooded,
normal human being who is a lot of fun and who is in touch with
life.

  More importantly, I observed and I am told that David Souter
handled his responsibilities as a counselor and as an adviser at
Harvard in a highly intelligent and caring fashion, with consistent
evenhandedness, with attention always to the intellectual, psycho-
logical and social dimensions of the challenges we face from day to
day.

  To test my recollection, I took the liberty of asking a few of our
colleagues, and I also spoke to some of the deans who would know
what he was up to, and the view seems to be fairly widely held that
Judge Souter was one of the best in his close dealings with a broad
cross-section of a very diverse class, year after year, a class of stu-
dents. The judge was intellectually challenging, as you would
expect for a university setting, but at the same time always dis-
tinctly humane, thoroughly fair, thoroughly considerate and effec-
tive in every respect in that very human calling.

  Some, especially in the written media, have called me and have
asked me a number of questions, knowing about my friendship
with Judge Souter going way, way back, and have asked me wheth-
er I have ever seen any signs of mean-spiritedness or prejudice on
his part, whether toward racial minorities like me or toward
women or otherwise. The answer is, in our personal dealings, in
what I have seen from day to day on a sustained period of time,
clearly and resoundingly no.

  Judge Souter in my view has always conveyed, quite the con-
trary, very fine sense of accountability, to high-mindedness, to ethi-
cal values and to religious precepts, which I consider the ultimate
guarantor, that hallmark of one who can be trusted. His charitable
urges and compassion and sense of decency and fair play always
seemed impeccable.
                                      751
  Again, I am pleased to serve as a character witness for the nomi-
nee. I am reminded of the remark that our other colleague, Eden
Martin, made last night. The people who know Judge Souter up
close and well and personally seem to have a lot of confidence in
him and to like him. This person is, in my view, a fine craftsman of
a judge and also, without question, an equally fine human being.
  Thank you.

                                              TESTIMONY OF

                   UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE DAVID H. SOUTER
                                                 TO BECOME

                ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                 Mr. Chairman, members of the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, I am pleased to testify as a character witness on
behalf of U.S. Circuit Judge David H. Souter, as you consider
his nomination to become an Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court.

                 My name is Wesley S. Williams, Jr. I am testifying
solely on my own behalf, and not for any group with which I may
be associated. For purposes of identification, you should know
that I am an attorney in the private practice of law here in
Washington, D.C. I commenced my legal career in 1967, as a
staff counsel with the then new District of Columbia Council,
and as a teaching assistant at Columbia University Law School.
Shortly thereafter I became legal counsel to the U.S. Senate
Committee on the District of Columbia, in the 91st Congress.
Then in 1970, 20 years ago this month, I joined the law firm of
Covington & Burling, where I have remained ever since, including
these last 15 years as one of the firm's partners.

                 Again for purposes of identification only, I have been
involved through the years in a range of outside legal, busi-
ness, and charitable activities -- from time to time as an ad-
junct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, general
counsel of the District of Columbia Bar, president of the met-
ropolitan area's largest private social welfare agency, chairman
of the board of a non-profit venture capital firm that special-
izes in promoting minority entrepreneurship in the broadcast
field, a member of the executive committee of a major civil
rights organization here in Washington, an officer of various
boards and committees of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and
of the Washington National Cathedral, an officer of the Harvard
Law School Association, and a member of Harvard University's
Board of Overseers (among other positions). By way of further
introduction, in addition to advanced degrees from Fletcher
School and Columbia University Law School, like David Souter I
hold bachelor's (BA 1963) and law (JD 1967) degrees from Harvard
University.

                  I am testifying as an old friend of David Souter. I
met the judge, and we enjoyed a passing acquaintance, during his
last two, my first two, undergraduate years at Harvard College.
Later, when he returned from his two years of study in England,
                                    753

and I from the Fletcher School's one-year program in interna-
tional relations, we overlapped two more years, this time at
Harvard Law School. It was at the Law School that we became
good friends. This was in part an outgrowth of our earlier
acquaintance, in part an outgrowth of our mutual involvement in
a social club for budding lawyers at Harvard Law School, and
chiefly an outgrowth of the fact that neither of us lived at the
Law School itself, but rather in Harvard Yard. Like some pre-
sent and past members of the Senate and of the Supreme Court,
Judge Souter and I held faculty appointments as Freshman Proc-
tors, that is to say, as resident counselors to Harvard fresh-
men, and as members of the University's Board of Faculty Advi-
sers. As as result, I believe I had lunch or dinner with David
Souter at least a half dozen times a week for two years, and
otherwise saw him with some frequency, both in social settings
and as we went about our work as counselors and advisers,
throughout our two years together at law school.

                  It seems fitting that I give this testimony, because I
have a sense of the quality of individual now on your docket as
a nominee. I would guess that the issue of the measure of the
man must weigh heavily on your minds at this time, since Judge
Souter comes to you, yes, as an accomplished legal craftsman,
but with no discernible (and, I believe, no actual) political or
ideological agenda. I think it is also significant that Judge
Souter and I crossed paths at a stage when he was mature enough
to afford his friends a glimpse of the person he would always be
-- which was also a stage marked by optimal candor, when none of
us was as yet in the public eye.

                  I apologize for my prolix wind-up. But I wanted to
give you some comfort, or at least some basis to assess, as I
venture to characterize the nominee in broad terms, in this
exceptionally important context.

                 Briefly, in my experience, Judge Souter is every bit
the fine human being that his advocates have portrayed him to
be. /He of course has a keen sense of privacy, of the sort we
associate with small-town and rural America from shore to shore.
Judge Souter likewise has a refined sense of propriety, a sense
of appropriateness as to the time and place for particular con-
duct -- what I and others consider to be an altogether desirable
public bearing for a judge. So here he is, as he should be,
respectful and demure. But by the same token, in appropriate
settings, David Souter displays as much zest as you or I, for
the play of ideas, for good humor and good honest fun, for
"belly laughs," even, which is to say for life itself. In fact
-- and I hope that this will not embarrass him -- the judge's
reputation is of being a master of the "bon mot," a master at
                    754

the leisure-time sport of matching well phrased, clever in-
sights.

                 More importantly, I observed and I am told that David
Souter handled his responsibilities as a counselor and advisor
at Harvard College in an intelligent and caring fashion -- with
consistent even-handedness, and with attention always to the
intellectual, psychological, and social dimensions of the chal-
lenges we proctors faced from day to day. Incidentally, to test
my recollection, I took the liberty of surveying a few of our
contemporaries, other proctors and advisors from the mid-60s, as
well as deans who are familiar with Judge Souter's performance
and reputation. The view seems widely held that David Souter
was one of the best. In a word, in his close dealings with a
broad cross-section of Harvard's diverse freshman class, David
Souter comported himself, year after year, in a manner that was
intellectually challenging and at the same time distinctly hu-
mane. He was, in sum, thoroughly fair, considerate, and withal
quite effective, in a very human calling.

                 Some have asked me whether I ever detected in David
Souter signs of mean-spiritedness or prejudice, whether towards
racial minorities (like me, for example), or towards women, or
otherwise; and the answer is a clear and resounding no. Indeed,
David Souter in my view has always conveyed that sense of ac-
countability -- to high-mindedness, to ethical values, and to
religious precepts -- which I consider the hallmark of one who
can be trusted. Stated another way, the man's charitable urges
and compassion appeared intact.

                 Again, I am pleased to serve as a character witness
for the nominee you are considering for the Supreme Court, for
David Souter -- a fine craftsman of a judge and, in my experi-
ence, without question an equally fine human being.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Since I am going to have to leave now and go to that meeting for
a few moments, let me ask, with the indulgence of my colleagues,
one question of you, Mr. Williams. One of the criticisms of the
judge that we have heard is not that he is prejudiced. It is that he
is insensitive.
  During the time you and he were classmates--although you were
2 years apart but you overlapped--during the time you ate lunch
or dinner or breakfast with him, roughly six times a week over a
period of 2 years, the whole country was being turned upside down.
Bull Connor had dogs that were running through the streets. The
country was in turmoil. Martin Luther King was attempting to
make a case for black Americans.
  Did he ever evidence any empathy, sympathy, or concern for the
plight of black Americans in their fight for equality during that
period?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. In what way?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I would say that Judge Souter, particularly given
his background, was not disposed to be in the fray. I think the
record states that pretty clearly. On the other hand, he was awak-
ening to it, was intrigued by it, and was moved by it.
  None of us could avoid talking about all those things, and I am
glad that you have put this all in context, because those were tu-
multuous times. My first class in civil procedure involved not the
usual subjects but, rather, a discussion of the march in Selma at
Harvard Law School. Those were very special times. I would say
that David Souter in my recollection was, like most Americans at
that time, awakening to a very, very grave problem. He is listen-
ing, he is learning, and I think that the compassion and all the
human qualities that are necessary
  The CHAIRMAN. Was there any show of emotion?
  Mr. WILLIAMS [continuing]. To bring him to the point of having a
real understanding are there.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you ever remember David Souter saying any-
thing along the lines of, Wesley, how can you stand it? How can
you put up with this? I mean anything that evidenced not only un-
derstanding and awakening but anger? Or was Judge Souter the
type, well, you know, now the march in Selma, the issue of civil
disobedience is something that we really should discuss, because
what happened there was arguably an issue, I mean, in what con-
text was this awakening taking place? Was it an intellectual awak-
ening, and was it also an emotional awakening?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. It was an awakening of understanding which I
think was quite complete.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I think you are being a very good lawyer.
You haven't answered my question. Was there any show of emo-
tion ever, any show of feeling beyond the awakening? I mean,
people can be awakened a lot of ways. People can be awakened and
say, you know, I didn't realize that was a problem and, golly, some
day we are going to have to solve it. Or awakening can be, that is
outrageous, I can't believe that is happening, how can you put up
with that, Wesley, does it ever happen to you, did anybody ever do
that to you.

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Those kinds of questions, what had my experience
been, they were obviously part of the dialog always.

  The CHAIRMAN. In this case, I must respectfully suggest that
nothing is obvious in this hearing. [Laughter.]

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Well, in any event, they were surely part of the
dialog. That was always very much on the table in every conversa-
tion. Do I remember particular conversations and the content
thereof? No. No. It has been a long time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Did he ever go to a rally with you, a meeting
with you? There must have been some things happening on
campus.

  Mr. WILLIAMS. We were at rallies inevitably, but for a purpose
that is a little different, which was that as officers of the university
we were responsible for making sure that things didn't get out of
hand. So, yes, I am sure we were at rallies. Whether we were sym-
pathetic or not and so forth, who can read the heart of a man? But,
in any event, I am heartened by the fact that he was concerned
about the issues--and remains so, apparently--and deeply con-
cerned and always listening.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I appreciate my colleagues allowing me the
indulgence of questioning one witness before the other two have
spoken. Hopefully, I will be back, gentlemen, before the question-
ing of the two of you is over.

  Let's proceed with Mr. Beck's testimony now. Again, I apologize.
I am going to have to leave.

                   STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. BECK
  Mr. BECK. NO apology necessary, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very
much for your comments.
  My name is Robert L. Beck, and I am the immediate past chair-
man of the board and chief executive officer of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving.
  In 1982, I joined MADD following the death of my son, Michael,
and his fiance, Lori, at the hands of a drunk driver.
  As many of you know, this is the most frequently committed
crime in America today. Some 22,000 people will die at the hands
of drunk drivers this year. That is about 60 people a day, and sev-
eral people will die while I give this testimony.
  The mission of MADD is to stop the death and destruction from
drunk driving and to be the voice of the victims of that crime. Our
membership numbers approximately 3 million members and sup-
porters, and we have some 400 chapters across the United States
and operations in five foreign countries. This makes MADD today
the largest organization of its kind, grassroots organization.
  The education and public awareness programs of MADD have
played a leadership role in changing public attitudes about drunk
driving. Drunk driving is no longer considered an accident. It is
seen for what it is: a violent crime, committed willfully, and in
total disregard of the rights of an innocent public.
  This change in attitude has permitted the enactment of stronger
laws and more law enforcement. The law raising the minimum
drinking age to 21 has saved thousands of young lives. MADD, with
the help of Federal incentive grants authorized in the 1988 Omni-
                                      757
bus Anti-Drug Abuse Act, is working to enact administrative li-
cense revocation in all States where it does not exist, along with
Senators like Senator Biden and Senator Thurmond, who have
helped try to sponsor legislation to change the loopholes in the
Federal bankruptcy statutes which have permitted convicted DWI
criminals to avoid their debts in dealing with bankruptcy to vic-
tims. You have also sponsored legislation to increase penalties for
drunk driving in cases involving young children.

  As America has learned from MADD over the past 10 years, so,
too, has MADD learned. We have learned that tougher laws and
more enforcement is useless without a strong, independent, and
fearless judiciary to ensure that these laws are carried out. MADD
understands that the courts need to keep a balance between the
rights of our citizens as a society and as individuals. MADD faces a
similar challenge. We seek to enforce the laws to protect all citi-
zens from the criminal drunk driver. This is a right of society as a
whole. Yet MADD is also an advocate for the individual rights of
victims.

  In no place is this more important than in our picture of the ju-
diciary and presented in the U.S. Supreme Court. This is particu-
larly true in the last term of that Court. It saw the Court wrestle
with the balancing of rights in the sobriety checkpoint case, Michi-
gan v. Sitz, and the use of video cameras to examine the condition
of an alleged drunk driver in Pennsylvania v. Muniz. We, there-
fore, see the selection of Justices for the U.S. Supreme Court as ex-
tremely vital to the interests of MADD as well as the vital interest
of our Nation.

  As we view the selection process, we took a two-pronged ap-
proach in making an evaluation of candidates. The first test was
we looked at the historical clarity and consistency of the thought
process followed by the candidate in his or her judicial decisions.
The second test looked to the results reached from those decisions
and whether they were supportive of the mission and goals of
MADD.

  We asked ourselves about Judge Souter: Did he evidence an open
mind toward drunk driving and related cases? Did he demonstrate
mental acuity and a superior grasp of the Constitution and its his-
tory? Was there a quality of excellence in his legal analysis? And
did he demonstrate judicial independence? There was a consistent
application of all of this, in our opinion. We looked at some 200 of
Judge Souter's opinions and decisions.

  I think in the interest of time I will let you read through the
analysis of the State of New Hampshire v. Koppel, which we have
selected as a typical case to demonstrate the five points that I have
just outlined.

  I think the last thing that I would like to point out this morning
is that MADD has not attempted to predict how Judge David
Souter would act in the future. I think this is an impossible task.
We have evaluated how he has acted in the past. We have looked
for insight. We have looked for sensitivity to the rights of victims
of drunk driving and the rights of society to be protected from the
drunk driver. We like what we have seen. MADD is proud of its
role in changing society's view regarding drunk driving, the drunk
driver, and their victims. We have looked at the record of Judge

        39-454--91 25
                                             758

Souter and find that, on balance, his understands the true magni-
tude of this crime. We have concluded that Judge Souter and
MADD share a common view of this particular crime and its conse-
quences. He has demonstrated an ability to balance the historical
values inherent in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights with the
fact that those documents must be relevant to current history.

  We, therefore, respectfully recommend your favorable consider-
ation of David Souter as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court. Thank you.

                                             WASHINGTON, D.C.
                                           SEPTEMBER 18, 1990

         MR. CHAIRMAN, MY NAME IS ROBERT L. BECK. I AM AN ATTORNEY AND
BUSINESSMAN IN DALLAS, TEXAS. I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MOTHERS
AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING (MADD) TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THE NOMINATION
OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

         IN 1982, I JOINED MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING AFTER MY ONLY
SON, MICHAEL, AND HIS FIANCEE, LORI PFANN, WERE KILLED BY A DRUNK
DRIVER. I AM THE IMMEDIATE PAST NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF MADD AND CONTINUE TO SERVE ON ITS BOARD
OF DIRECTORS.
                                     760

         AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, DRUNK DRIVING IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY
COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIME IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY. DRUNK DRIVERS WILL
KILL MORE THAN 22,000 INNOCENT VICTIMS THIS YEAR. THEY KILL MORE
THAN 60 PEOPLE EACH DAY, AND WILL KILL SEVERAL PEOPLE WHILE I GIVE
THIS TESTIMONY.

         THE MISSION OF MADD IS TO STOP THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
CAUSED BY DRUNK DRIVING AND TO BE THE VOICE OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS
CRIME. 1990 MARKS THE 10 YEAR POINT IN THE HISTORY OF MADD.
DURING THAT 10 YEAR PERIOD, MADD HAS GROWN TO INCLUDE SOME
3,000,000 MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 400 CHAPTERS
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND OPERATIONS IN 5 FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
TODAY, MADD IS THE LARGEST GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATION OF ITS KIND IN
AMERICA.

         THE EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAMS OF MADD HAVE
PLAYED A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CHANGING PUBLIC ATTITUDES ABOUT DRUNK
DRIVING. DRUNK DRIVING IS NO LONGER SEEN AS AN ACCIDENT. IT IS
SEEN FOR WHAT IT IS ... A VIOLENT CRIME, COMMITTED BY WILLFULLY
DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED ... IN TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE
INNOCENT PUBLIC.

         THIS CHANGE IN PUBLIC ATTITUDE HAS PERMITTED ENACTMENT OF MUCH
TOUGHER LAWS AND STRONGER LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. THE LAW RAISING
THE LEGAL MINIMUM DRINKING AGE TO 21 HAS SAVED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG
LIVES. MADD, WITH THE HELP OF FEDERAL INCENTIVE GRANTS AUTHORIZED
IN 1988 AS PART OF THE OMNIBUS ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT, IS WORKING TO
ENACT ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSE REVOCATION STATUTES IN ALL STATES
WHICH LACK SUCH LAWS. YOU, MR CHAIRMAN, ALONG WITH SENATOR
THURMOND AND OTHERS IN THE SENATE HAVE SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO
CLOSE LOOPHOLES IN THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY STATUTES WHICH HAVE
PERMITTED CONVICTED DWI CRIMINALS TO AVOID THEIR DEBTS TO THEIR
                                    761

VICTIMS BY DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. YOU HAVE ALSO SPONSORED
LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE PENALTIES FOR DRUNK DRIVING IN CASES
INVOLVING YOUNG CHILDREN.

         AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS LEARNED FROM MADD OVER THE PAST 10
YEARS, SO TOO HAS MADD LEARNED. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT TOUGHER LAWS
AND MORE ENFORCEMENT ARE USELESS WITHOUT A STRONG, INDEPENDENT AND
FEARLESS JUDICIARY TO INSURE THAT THESE LAWS ARE CARRIED OUT. MADD
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE COURTS NEED TO KEEP IN BALANCE THE RIGHTS OF
OUR CITIZENS AS A SOCIETY AND AS INDIVIDUALS. MADD FACES A SIMILAR
CHALLENGE. WE SEEK FULL ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW TO PROTECT ALL
CITIZENS FROM THE CRIMINAL DRUNK DRIVER. THIS IS A RIGHT OF
SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. YET, MADD IS ALSO AN ADVOCATE FOR THE
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF VICTIMS.

         IN NO PLACE HAS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE JUDICIARY BEEN MORE
CLEARLY PRESENTED THAN IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, AND IN
PARTICULAR, THE MOST RECENT TERM OF THAT COURT. IT SAW THE COURT
WRESTLE WITH THE BALANCING OF RIGHTS IN THE SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT
CASE, MICHIGAN V. SITZ. 110 US 2481 (1990) AND THE USE OF VIDEO
CAMERAS, TO EXAMINE THE CONDITION OF AN ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER IN
PENNSYLVANIA V. MUNIZ. USSC NO. 89-213 (1990). WE THEREFORE SEE
THE SELECTION OF JUSTICES FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AS EXTREMELY
VITAL TO THE INTERESTS OF MADD ... AND TO OUR NATION.

         AS WE VIEW THE SELECTION PROCESS, WE TOOK A 2-PRONGED APPROACH
TOWARD MAKING AN EVALUATION OF CANDIDATES. THE FIRST TEST LOOKS
TO THE HISTORICAL CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS
 FOLLOWED BY A CANDIDATE IN HIS OR HER JUDICIAL DECISIONS. THE
 SECOND TEST LOOKS AT THE RESULTS REACHED IN THE JUDICIAL DECISIONS
AND WHETHER THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE MISSION AND GOALS OF MADD.
 IN THIS CASE, THE ANALYSIS FOCUSED UPON JUDGE SOUTER AND HIS
 JUDICIAL CONDUCT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.
                                    762

         THE QUESTIONS WE CONSIDERED AS TO HIS CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY
WERE:

         FIRST; DID HE EVIDENCE AN OPEN MIND TOWARD DRUNK DRIVING AND
RELATED CASES?

         SECOND: DID HE DEMONSTRATE MENTAL ACUITY AND A SUPERIOR GRASP
OF THE CONSTITUTION AND ITS HISTORY?

         THIRD: WAS THERE A QUALITY OF EXCELLENCE IN HIS LEGAL
ANALYSIS?

         FOURTH: DID HE DEMONSTRATE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE; AND
         FIFTH: WAS THERE A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF ALL THE
FOREGOING FACTORS?

         WE REVIEWED MORE THAN 200 OF JUDGE SOUTER'S DECISIONS USING
THE ABOVE CRITERIA. WE OBSERVED CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF ALL 5
CRITERIA DURING HIS CAREER.

         WHILE REFERENCE TO ONE CASE OUT OF HUNDREDS HAS ITS
LIMITATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE V. KOPPEL. 127
NH 286 (1985) IS ILLUSTRATIVE. IT WAS A SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS CASE
DEALING WITH FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS ... SEARCH AND SEIZURE.

         JUDGE SOUTER DEMONSTRATED HIS INDEPENDENCE IN THIS CASE AS THE
SOLE DISSENTER. HE CHALLENGED THE MAJORITY, WHICH HELD THAT
SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BECAUSE OF THEIR
DEPARTURE FROM HISTORICAL LEGAL PRECEDENT... STATE AND FEDERAL.
JUDGE SOUTER'S DISSENT IN THIS CASE ALSO DEMONSTRATED AN
APPRECIATION FOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROTECTION OF BASIC
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE DEVELOPING LAW REGARDING THE
BALANCING AMONG RIGHTS.

         WHILE MANY WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT CASES
HAVE BECOME ENSNARED IN THE EMOTIONAL ISSUES WHICH SURROUND THIS
                                      763

AREA, JUDGE SOUTER DID NOT. HE SPENT HIS TIME TESTING THE RELEVANT
ISSUES TIED TO BALANCING, ON ONE HAND, THE RIGHTS OF INNOCENT
CITIZENS TO BE PROTECTED FROM VIOLENT CRIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS TO BE PROTECTED FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND
SEIZURE. HIS CONCLUSION NATURALLY FLOWED FROM HIS JUDICIAL
REASONING AND, ON BALANCE, HE CONCLUDED THAT CHECKPOINTS WERE
CONSTITUTIONALLY ACCEPTABLE.

         THE FINAL LESSON LEARNED FROM KOPPEL IS THAT 5 YEARS LATER,
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN SITZ V. MICHIGAN. 110 U.S. 2481 (1990),
HELD, USING VIRTUALLY THE SAME JUDICIAL REASONING AND LOGIC AS
JUDGE SOUTER IN THE KOPPEL CASE, THAT SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS WERE
PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE 4TH AMENDMENT AND WERE THEREFORE
CONSTITUTIONAL.

         MR. CHAIRMAN, MADD HAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO PREDICT HOW JUDGE
DAVID SOUTER WILL ACT IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE EVALUATED HOW HE HAS
ACTED IN THE PAST. WE HAVE LOOKED FOR INSIGHT. WE HAVE LOOKED FOR
SENSITIVITY TO THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS OF DRUNK DRIVING AND THE
RIGHTS OF SOCIETY TO BE PROTECTED FROM DRUNK DRIVERS. WE LIKE WHAT
WE HAVE SEEN. MADD IS PROUD OF ITS ROLE IN CHANGING SOCIETY'S VIEW
REGARDING DRUNK DRIVING, THE DRUNK DRIVER AND THEIR VICTIMS. WE
HAVE LOOKED AT THE RECORD OF JUDGE SOUTER TO FIND IF, ON BALANCE,
HIS VIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FLOWS IN THE DIRECTION OF
UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRIME OF DRUNK DRIVING.
WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT JUDGE SOUTER AND MADD SHARE A BASIC COMMON
VIEW OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. HE HAS
DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO BALANCE THE HISTORICAL VALUES INHERENT
IN THE CONSTITUTION AND BILL OF RIGHTS WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE
DOCUMENTS MUST BE RELEVANT TO CURRENT SOCIETY.

         WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND YOUR FAVORABLE
CONSIDERATION OF DAVID SOUTER AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT. THANK YOU.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Barr?

                     STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. BARR

  Mr. BARR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee. It is an honor to be here 5 minutes to speak before the Ju-
diciary Committee of the United States of America with regard to
a nominee to the highest court in the land, I daresay in the world.
It is worth more than many years of struggle in other countries. It
is an opportunity that we in Southeastern Legal Foundation realize
the importance of and deeply appreciate being able to be here
today to speak--not so much on behalf of or against Judge David
Souter, but on something that we believe is even more important
than any single nominee, than any single President, and than any
single Senator or Senate body, and that is on behalf of the process
of confirming nominees that is embodied in our Constitution;
namely, the advise and consent role of the U.S. Senate.

  Of the many of the provisions in our Constitution, the most im-
portant ones are frequently the shortest. That is, I think, by design
of our Founding Fathers, and I think that we ought to keep that in
mind as we go through the confirmation process and focusing on
the advise and consent role. There is a great deal more written
about other provisions in our Constitution than this one, but we be-
lieve that the importance of the advise and consent role is really
second to none in its importance to the people and to the sanctity
of the judicial process in our country, which, of course, is the bul-
wark on which all other aspects of our Government and our lives
in this country rest.

  We believe that in focusing on that advise and consent role, the
issues are very clear. They were clear to our Founding Fathers as
set forth, for example, in Federalist Paper No. 76 by Alexander
Hamilton and other writers after him, most recently by publica-
tions from this very city, that the advise and consent role of the
Senate, as important and as profound as it is, is very limited in
scope. We believe that to stray from that very limited focus, to
focus on the constitutional understanding of nominees, to focus on
their judicial temperament, their ability to reason, their back-
ground as judges or whatever background they bring to their nomi-
nation, is and should be the sole focus of this committee. We be-
lieve also that for other groups to come forward, other individuals
and groups to come forward, as important as the issues are that
are on their minds and in their hearts, to bring a political agenda
to the committee demeans the process of advise and consent; and,
indeed, to focus on those aspects of a nominee's opinions or how he
or she might rule on a particular case, as opposed to the process
that they bring to ruling on a particular case, is inappropriate and
raises very serious questions about separating the political from
the judicial processes and ideology of our country.

  We believe that for groups to come forward and place before this
committee a political agenda on which to base a vote on this nomi-
nee, or any nominee, is to attempt to perhaps come in through the
back door of the political process what they have been unable to
accomplish through the front door, namely the ballot box. We be-
                                             765

lieve that that is inappropriate. It is inappropriate for any group,
whichever side of the political spectrum they are from or whichev-
er side of the spectrum on a particular issue, again, no matter how
important those issues are, such as civil rights, abortion, property
rights, the ability to tax. There is a whole panoply of issues.

  Those issues really have no role in being placed before this com-
mittee on behalf of a nominee or against a nominee in his or her
opinions and how they might rule. This is something that I know
has been gone into in a number of contexts and through a number
of witnesses but what we believe is a thread that should run
throughout the entire process. We believe to stray from that and to
place before this committee a nominee and question him or her on
how they might rule on a particular case, even if it is done obtuse-
ly, if that is the point of the questioning, then we are placing that
future Justice in a very untenable situation.

  If, then, an issue comes before that person while they sit on the
highest Court of this land, for example, and they have already ren-
dered an opinion on how they might rule on case "X" or issue "X,"
and they, in fact, rule that way, then they and the Court are sub-
ject to have its credibility attacked for prejudging issues, for judg-
ing issues before they come before that Court, and for making up
their mind beforehand. We believe that attacks and that demeans
the credibility of the Court.

  On the other hand, if that nominee has rendered an opinion or
has been forced to render an opinion at a hearing on issue "X" and
then rules differently, then that Justice and that Court in the
future--not just on that case--is then subject to criticism for
changing its mind or for waffling. In either instance, that Justice
and that Court is caught in a Hobson's choice, a dilemma. And we
believe it is unfair and really an improper use of the advise and
consent process to place nominees in that posture.

  Again, we appreciate the opportunity to be here. I would appreci-
ate, Mr. Chairman, if the written comments that I have prepared,
which go into this in a little more detail, could be made a part of
the record. I will not belabor that point, but certainly we believe
that is an extremely important function of this committee. We ap-
preciate the opportunity to make these matters known on the
record and also to answer any questions that the members might
have.

         TESTIMONY OF ROBERT L. BARR, JR.
PRESIDENT, SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION

   BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
ON THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE DAVID SOUTER

        MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, ON BEHALF OF
SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION, AND ITS OFFICERS AND
SUPPORTERS, I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE
FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY TO COMMENT ON
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR JUDGE DAVID SOUTER TO BE AN
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

         THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NOMINATION PROCESS FOR A JUSTICE TO
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FAR TRANSCENDS THAT OF ANY
NOMINEE, ANY PRESIDENT, OR ANY SENATOR. THE IMPORTANCE OF
THIS PROCESS, AND THE NEED TO MAINTAIN ITS INTEGRITY, IS OF
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE ENTIRE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THIS
COUNTRY, AND CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE BULWARKS OF THIS REPUBLIC.

         EACH SECTION, AND EVERY WORD OF THE CONSTITUTION DESERVES
THE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND DEFERENCE BY ALL AMERICANS.

         WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADVISE - AND - CONSENT FUNCTION OF
THE UNITED STATES SENATE, IN CONSIDERING THE PRESIDENT'S
NOMINEES FOR HIGH OFFICE, MUST BE GRANTED EXTREME DEFERENCE,
AND THAT NO EFFORT OUGHT TO BE SPARED TO INSURE THAT IT IS
IMPLEMENTED ACCORDING TO THE STRICTEST INTERPRETATION OF THE
FOUNDING FATHERS' DESIGN.

          WE BELIEVE ALSO THAT THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF
 ALL FEDERAL JUDGES, AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT
 GENERALLY, REQUIRES THAT THERE BE NO EFFORT, BY THE PRESIDENT
 OR THE SENATE, AT ANY PHASE OF THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, TO
 INTERJECT POLITICAL VIEWS OR PERSONAL OPINIONS, ON EITHER THE
 PART OF THE QUESTIONERS OR OF THE NOMINEE. TO DO SO WOULD
 NECESSARILY AND INEVITABLY BRING INTO QUESTION MATTERS ON
 WHICH THAT NOMINEE, IF CONFIRMED, MIGHT BE CALLED ON LATER TO
                                 768

DECIDE. AND, EVEN IF THAT NOMINEE, ONCE CONFIRMED, IS NOT
FACED WITH ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC POLITICAL ISSUES OR
PERSONAL OPINIONS ABOUT WHICH HE WAS QUESTIONED DURING THE
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, THERE WILL INEVITABLY COME BEFORE HIM OR
HER MATTERS THAT DEAL WITH THE SAME CONCERNS AND ISSUES.

         IF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HAS BEEN FORCED TO TAKE A
POSITION OR OFFER AN OPINION AS TO HOW THEY MIGHT RULE ON A
PARTICULAR ISSUE OR IN A PARTICULAR CASE, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THAT CASE OR ISSUE COMES BEFORE THEM DIRECTLY WHILE ON
THE BENCH, THEY WILL BE CAUGHT IN A HOBSON'S CHOICE THAT
DIMINISHES THE CREDIBILITY OF ALL THEIR WORK AS A JUSTICE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE NOMINEE VOLUNTEERS OR IS FORCED TO PROVIDE
AN OPINION ON ISSUE "X" AND THEN THAT ISSUE, OR ONE THAT
RAISES THE SAME LEGAL QUESTION, COMES BEFORE THEM, AND THEY
RULE DIFFERENTLY THAN INDICATED DURING THE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS, THE JUSTICE WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR "WAFFLING,"
VACILLATING OR BEING WEAK AND INCONSISTENT. IN SHORT, THEIR
CREDIBILITY AND PERSONAL INTEGRITY WILL BE ATTACKED AND WILL
CLOUD ALL FUTURE OPINIONS.

         IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT JUSTICE DECIDES AN ISSUE AS
A JUSTICE, CONSISTENT WITH HIS OR HER OPINION RENDERED DURING
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, THEY WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR HAVING
PREJUDGED AN ISSUE; HAVING MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFOREHAND; AND
NOT DECIDING THE ISSUE BEFORE THEM AS A JUSTICE BASED ON THE
MERITS AND PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENTED DURING
THE PRESENTATION OF THE CASE ITSELF. THIS TOO, WILL THEN
CLOUD THEIR TENURE AND REDUCE THEIR CREDIBILITY.

         IN NEITHER INSTANCE, IS ANYTHING GAINED BY SO QUESTIONING
THE NOMINEE OR BY THE NOMINEE RENDERING SUCH OPINIONS, OTHER
                                   769

THAN SATISFYING ONE'S CURIOSITY. BUT A VERY HIGH PRICE HAS
BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE INTEGRITY AND CREDIBILITY OF THAT
JUSTICE AND INDEED OF THE HIGH COURT ITSELF. THE COURT'S
INTEGRITY WILL HAVE BEEN DRAWN INTO QUESTION, THEREBY
WEAKENING ALL OF ITS WORK FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.

         WE BELIEVE THAT, THROUGH PROBING AND IN- SIGHTFUL
QUESTIONING BY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS DURING
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS-- INQUIRING IN DEPTH INTO A NOMINEE'S
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, BACKGROUND AND CREDENTIALS--THE SENATE
SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO LEARN SUFFICIENTLY ABOUT THE
NOMINEE'S APPROACH TO LEGAL ISSUES, INCLUDING THE WHOLE RANGE
OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT THEY MIGHT BE CALLED ON TO
DECIDE, WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFIC SPECIFIC OPINIONS OR
CASES.

         MOREOVER, DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF A NOMINATION AND A FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE, THERE IS FULL
AND WELL-PUBLICIZED OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CITIZENS AND CITIZEN
GROUPS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, TO
CAREFULLY REVIEW AND ANALYZE THE NOMINEE'S WRITINGS, OPINIONS,
CREDENTIALS, AND PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE. THIS IS THE
"POLITICAL" PHASE OF THE PROCESS; AND IF CITIZENS HAVE A
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S CHOICE, THEIR BEEF IS WITH
THE PRESIDENT AND THEY SHOULD EXTRACT A POLITICAL PRICE FROM
HIM AT THE NEXT ELECTION; THE FORUM FOR THIS IS NOT THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING. THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS A
QUITE DISTINCTLY SEPARATE PHASE OF THIS PROCESS. POLITICAL
CONCERNS HAVE NO ROLE WHATSOEVER.

         EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR IS FREE TO MAKE HIS OR HER CHOICE
IN VOTING ON THE NOMINEE BASED ON WHATEVER CRITERIA THEY LIKE.
                                 770

BUT PROBING INTO A NOMINEE'S OPINIONS IS SIMPLY NOT NECESSARY
AND IT VIOLATES THE ADVISE-AND-CONSENT ROLE OF THE SENATE.

        WHILE SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION TAKES NO OFFICIAL
POSITION FOR OR AGAINST THE NOMINATION OF DAVID SOUTER TO BE
AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WE
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO INQUIRE INTO JUDGE
SOUTER'S JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT AND PHILOSOPHY, IN AN EFFORT TO
INSURE THAT HE, OR ANY NOMINEE, PLACES THE ROLE OF A SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE. THAT PERSPECTIVE IS,
THAT ALL FEDERAL APPELLATE JUDGES MUST SERVE THE PUBLIC,
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR SWORN OATH OF OFFICE, BY INTERPRETING
LAWS NOT MAKING THEM. THE MAKING OF LAWS IS THE FUNCTION OF
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT; WE CANNOT IMAGINE THAT
ANY MEMBER OF THE SENATE WOULD SEEK, THROUGH MODIFYING THE
ADVISE-AND-CONSENT FUNCTION, TO HAVE A NOMINEE TELL THE SENATE
HOW TO MAKE LAWS OR WHETHER THE LAWS IT HAS PASSED ARE GOOD OR
BAD. THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE; IT
NEVER HAS BEEN THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE; AND IT NEVER SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

         WE THANK THE COMMITTEE ONCE AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO
PROVIDE INPUT ON THIS CRITICAL ASPECT OF OUR DEMOCRACY, AND I
WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER FURTHER QUESTIONS OR
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  All of the statements in their entirety will be included in the
record. I have no questions.
  Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. I want to thank you all for coming here and
testifying. Taking time to come here shows you are interested in
this matter, and it shows your admiration, I think, for Judge
Souter.
  Now, Judge Souter was propounded several questions that he de-
clined to answer because those questions might come before the
Court. He is a judge now on the circuit court. He has been nomi-
nated to the Supreme Court.
  In your opinion, did he take the proper stance to refuse to
answer those questions? I would be glad to start with you.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Senator, on balance, I think he has taken the
proper approach, given the two circumstances that you addressed:
No. 1, that he has been asked a number of questions that relate to
matters that would be coming before Supreme Court and matters
that would be of live interest before the Supreme Court, not just
ancillary issues but matters that are quite fundamental. Second, he
sits on a court now that also has to deal with such issues.
  I think under the total circumstances it probably would be quite
inappropriate for him to express views, if he had them. One of the
things that I would urge you to give some consideration to is that
perhaps the judge doesn't have well-founded views on these issues
but instead is prepared to listen and to assess, as his skill affords
him the opportunity.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Beck?
  Mr. BECK. I would share the comments of Mr. Williams. I think
it is appropriate under both the ethics provisions and as a sitting
judge to not
  Senator THURMOND. Speak out. You all speak into the machine.
We can't hear you.
  Mr. BECK. Yes, sir. I think it is perfectly appropriate for a sitting
judge not to give his opinion on things that are about to or prospec-
tively will be heard by the Court. I think that, on balance, that was
appropriate conduct.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Barr?
  Mr. BARR. Senator Thurmond, we at Southeastern Legal Founda-
tion are a body very interested in maintaining the sanctity of the
rule of law in this country and all constitutional processes thereun-
der, and we believe that for Judge Souter to have done anything
else in our opinion would have cast doubt on his ability to properly
serve on the Court. I think he took the only proper course ethically
and in line with the correct reasoning, we believe, under the Con-
stitution in refusing to be drawn into those debates and rendering
those opinions.
  Senator THURMOND. In fact, wouldn't he have violated the rule of
ethics if he had answered such questions?
  Mr. BARR. It is my understanding of the rule of ethics as they
pertain to judges, the ABA rules, that he would have.
  Senator THURMOND. I want to ask all three of you this question.
You have studied his background; you have heard his testimony;
you are familiar with his education, training, and experience. Do
                                             772

you know of any reason whatever that he should not be confirmed
by this Senate?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. I do not.

   Mr. BECK. I do not.

   Mr. BARR. NO, sir. We do not see any.

  Senator THURMOND. I will ask you this last question: Is it your
opinion that Judge Souter has the competency, the dedication, the
courage, the integrity, and the fairness to be a Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States? Mr. Williams?

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Very definitely.
  Senator THURMOND. HOW is that?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Very definitely.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Beck?
  Mr. BECK. Based upon our analysis of his historical decisions and
the process he followed to reach his decisions, the answer would be
yes.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Barr?
  Mr. BARR. Yes, Senator Thurmond, we believe that.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all the questions I have. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  Let me ask you, Mr. Williams, would your position be any differ-
ent if Mr. Souter would not discuss the rationale or legal reasoning
in Brown v. Board of Education?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Would my position be any different if he would
not?
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I have listened to your discussion, the committee's
discussion--not your personal discussion--of that issue with him
and to the discussion of the various witnesses on that subject, and I
believe that the Brown v. Board of Education underlying reasoning
is eminently settled and probably at that level of fundamental
principle not likely to be challenged in ways that would make it a
live issue before the Court, either before the court on which he sits
or before the Supreme Court. I think that is a fact if you analyze
the dockets of those two courts.
  The situation is not the same. The country is being really rent
asunder, as you know, by the abortion issue, and I think that it has
become a live political topic that really probably at this time in our
history requires a little different approach. It is an interesting
question, and I don't come to that conclusion easily.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is somewhat more than an interesting
question. What year do you think it became settled law, the issue
of race discrimination?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Oh, gee, I don't think I am qualified to tell
you
  Senator KENNEDY. Was there sometime when it was
  Mr. WILLIAMS. It was certainly a settled question with me long
before it became settled with the Supreme Court.
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU don't think that there is a parallelism in
terms of questions of the constitutional rights in privacy?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I think that stating the question as broadly as you
have, having to do with constitutional rights of privacy, I think
maybe is not quite the question that we are talking about here. I
                                             773

think basically we are talking about a manifestation of the consti-
tutional rights of privacy in a context that has taken on political
dimensions.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, for how many years now in the Roe situ-
ation has that been settled law?

  Mr. WILLIAMS. I am not quite sure what your question, how
many years has it been since Roe was, in fact, ordered, or how
many years since it has been settled law in the minds of the judges
of the judiciary generally or in terms of the way in which courts
deal with the matters. I think we know the issue is

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the Supreme Court is the law of the
land and

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Right. I think we know that the
  Senator KENNEDY. In regard to Roe it has been in effect for some
17 years.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes. But I think the question that you are asking,
I believe, is the same question you were asking in the Brown con-
text, which is how long has it been settled in the minds of the judi-
ciary, and I think there is a lot of questions about that. Some
people would say that it is not settled. Some others would say it is
quite settled; aspects of it are, other aspects of it are not.
  As I said, it is not a simple matter.
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU noticed that the judge was willing to
speak about the death penalty and how many issues are going to be
coming up before the Supreme Court with regard to the death pen-
alty and various provisions of what is cruel and unusual punish-
ment. They may very well have that Racial Justice Act which this
committee has reported out in regards to the use of the death pen-
alty in a discriminatory manner. Yet Judge Souter expressed no
reservation whatsoever in expressing his view on that issue. That
certainly may very well be a question that will come up in terms of
that particular provision.
   Mr. WILLIAMS. Senator, unfortunately I did not review Judge
Souter's remarks on that issue. I am not familiar with them, and I
can't corroborate whether that is the case or not.
   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
   Senator DeConcini?
   Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Williams, I missed the first part of your statement, but I
gather you are a long-time friend of Judge Souter's. Is that correct?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes.

   Senator DECONCINI. YOU went to school with him, and you know
him on a personal basis.

   Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes, Senator.
   Senator DECONCINI. Socially as well as professionally?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes.

   Senator DECONCINI. Can you express to this committee, do you
think he is an ideologue in his political directions or his philosophy
as it relates to Government and Government involvement in peo-
ple's lives?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. I would say that if one thing is clear to me about
David Souter, it is that he is not an ideologue and that he comes to
this with no political agenda. It is rather remarkable. He is not an
ideologue. He doesn't have a political agenda. He is intensely curi-
                                                774

ous intellectually. He has a certain sense of the degree of the im-
portance of not getting too much ahead of himself in terms of arro-
gating unto the judiciary some of the things that perhaps courts
from time to time become more involved in. But at a time when we
have the Congress in good hands, I take comfort in knowing that
we would have in Judge Souter one who would listen carefully and
try to administer the Congress' laws as they have been written.

  Senator DECONCINI. Has your relationship been such that you
discuss political issues?

  Mr. WILLIAMS. Actually not. I mean, we were all in formation at
the outset, and I would say it was a heyday of the jurisprudence of
Justice Brandeis and notions of judicial restraint there and the
craftsmanship of John Marshall Harlan. That seemed to be the
predominant standard that students were called to address, and,
frankly, I personally have seen a lot of similarity and detected a lot
of sympathy

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU have never sat around
  Mr. WILLIAMS. On his part on those issues.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU have never sat around having a beer or
a cup of coffee or lunch or dinner with him and talked political
philosophy?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Not as such, no.
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you know offhand his personal view on
the death penalty?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. I do not.

  Senator DECONCINI. Or on abortion?

   Mr. WILLIAMS. I do not.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Williams, I am concerned about the experience that Judge
Souter may have had with Afro-Americans on understanding their
problems. There was some testimony about some of his other expe-
rience. This is obviously not a ground for rejection, but I think it is
a ground which warrants some exploration.
  Did you have an opportunity to hear or review the testimony of
Mr. Joseph Rauh, the head of the Civil Rights Leadership Confer-
ence?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. NO, I did not. I would have enjoyed doing so since
I very much respect Mr. Rauh.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Mr. Rauh testified yesterday. I did not
get a copy of his prepared testimony, and he is in the room today. I
had asked if he had one. He is a great extemporaneous speaker,
and he testified without prepared testimony, but had you heard
that and been in the position to comment, I would have been inter-
ested.
  In the absence of that, I am interested to know what you know
about Judge Souter's exposure to the Afro-American or black com-
munity. He has lived in a State which does not have the kinds of
problems that, say, Philadelphia, PA, has, or other major American
cities have. There is a good bit to the feel of those kinds of prob-
lems, and I would be interested in what you could give us in a fac-
tual context which would shed some light on his experience in that
context.
                                             775

  Mr. WILLIAMS. All I know, Senator, is that in our years in Boston
and Cambridge, certainly David Souter had as much exposure as
anyone else to African-Americans.

  Senator SPECTER. That may not be a whole lot in Cambridge at
Harvard. It could be in Boston.

  Mr. WILLIAMS. That may or may not be true relative to the coun-
try and to the community of universities to which our alma mater
belongs. I think it was more than at most in those days, but

  Senator SPECTER. Well, but that is a different
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I have not reached my conclusion, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. OK.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I would also say that surely he had responsibility
for supervising and for looking after minority students and
  Senator SPECTER. Many?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I would say some, not many. The number has
grown dramatically, but it was certainly a lot more in the years
when we were faculty advisers than in the year when I was a stu-
dent. I was
  Senator SPECTER. Could you give an approximation as to how
many black students he counseled?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Oh, I would say all of us had--I would say the mi-
nority population of the class was probably somewhere on the
order of 5 percent in those days. That was out of a class of maybe
1,200.
  But let me say that I cannot give you factual information that
can confirm to you that David Souter has been widely exposed to
African-Americans. I tend to suspect that he has not. What I can
tell you is that in the dealings that he has had, I have had the im-
pression that he has been on a personal level--and I am not speak-
ing to larger political issues, but on a personal level he has been
eminently fair and has shown in that wonderful New England way
a remarkable color-blindness--a concern about the issues of the
day, yes, but no signs of uneasiness.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Mr. Williams, I certainly think it is possi-
ble to listen and learn a lot, but there is a difference if you have
experience. The kind of student that you would have at Harvard
College, Afro-American, is different from the kind that you face,
for example, in the discrimination cases which we are concerned
about under the Civil Rights Act. One of those matters is now
before the Congress. It arises in the Griggs case and the Ward's
Cove case, I am sure--you are nodding in the affirmative--where
you really have a feel for the underclass of minorities who are
seeking employment. The Court has set up some very important
guidelines beyond actual discrimination where we have the so-
called disparate impact, illustratively where a community may be,
like Philadelphia, 45 percent Afro-American, and illustratively
there may be only a few percentage in the work force.
  That doesn't prove discrimination, but the Court sets up a stand-
ard; if there is that disparity, then the employer has to show busi-
ness necessity because it may not be possible and there may be
very good business reasons. That sets the context of controversy
which is now in the Congress. The Senate has passed a bill to
change Ward's Cove; so has the House. The President has suggested
a veto, and these issues are certain to come before the Court again.
                                                776

   If a person has had some experience, say, in the ghettos of a big
American city, has worked with problems of delinquency, problems
of young minorities trying to get a job, that experience would be
very helpful. I don't say it is indispensable. I don't think you can
give any litmus test or any indispensable prerequisites on these
lines, but I would be interested in your evaluation as to how he
would stack up on, say, the kind of an issue which would come up
in the disparate impact cases or how he would stack up if he has a
case like Metro Broadcasting.

   I notice in your resume that you are active in minority entrepre-
neurship, where you have a case like, set aside, City of Richmond
v. Croson or you have Bakke where some consideration is to be
given to race. Judge Souter did say that he would give some weight
to the racial factor.

  In that rather broad but very vital and important context, how
would you evaluate him?

  Mr. WILLIAMS. I am particularly glad that you mentioned the
Metro Broadcasting and Astroline cases, because in that context I
have thought a bit about this nomination and what the implica-
tions are. What you are referring to is the fact that I am chairman
of the board of a minority entrepreneur, of a capital venture firm,
a nonprofit firm that specializes in encouraging minority entrepre-
neurs in the broadcast field. Astroline and the Metro Broadcasting
cases were very much directed to things that are of key interest to
us.

  I had to ask myself, gee, is this the kind of case that David
Souter, as opposed to Justice Brennan, would have given us. I have
resolved the matter in my mind as follows, and it is on this basis
that I really find that I am quite comfortable in supporting his
nomination.

  David Souter understands. He has lived in the world. He is an
observer. He has seen the terrible situation that our minority pop-
ulations, including our African-American population, find them-
selves in. Against that backdrop and, I think, a very humane set of
values, I think he is prepared to do the right thing, so to speak, in
close cases. His fundamental jurisprudence would incline him to
follow your lead and to do what the Congress has outlined for the
courts to do.

  I have in mind the fact that there is very good legislation in this
area being developed in the House and Senate, and that the nation-
al legislature seems to be in very good shape on those issues. If
there is one person who you can count on absolutely trying to ad-
vance your principles in a way that is faithful to the legislation
that is presented to him, it would be David Souter. I think he is
fundamentally fair, I think that he is lacking in prejudice, and I
think that he is prepared to listen very carefully to the Congress.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. My time is up. I would
just like to conclude by thanking Mr. Beck and Mr. Barr for
coming. Regrettably, in a short round and with so many, many wit-
nesses, we don't have a chance to give appropriate deference to the
important ideas which you have mentioned in the question-and-
answer session. But I do thank you for being here.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
                                             777

  Senator Grassley?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Williams, so you think that Judge Souter
might rule the same way as Justice Brennan in the Metro Broad-
casting case?
  Mr. WILLIAMS. I don't know for sure. I would think that if there
were a Justice Brennan to start the ball rolling, Justice Souter
might be inclined to go along. But who is to tell? I would say, most
importantly--and this is the key to my understanding of the situa-
tion--if the Congress were to say that that is the kind of law we
would like, we could surely count on Justice Souter to support that.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. I, too, want to express
our appreciation for taking the time and giving us the benefit of
your judgment on the nominee. We appreciate it very much.
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you.
  Mr. BECK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. BARR. Thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Our next panel is Haywood Burns, immediate
past president of the National Lawyers Guild; Christopher Ryder, a
member of the advisory board of Supreme Court Watch; Paula Et-
telbrick, who is the legal director of Lambda Legal Defense Fund;
the next witness, Urvashi Vaid, who is the executive director of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force; and finally, Sara Rios, staff
attorney, Center for Constitutional Rights.
  We want to welcome all of you. We appreciate your willingness
to come here this morning and give us the benefit of your judg-
ment. We would ask your cooperation in respecting the time con-
straints that the committee is under and the fact that there are a
number of other witnesses as well. But we want very much to hear
your testimony. So we will proceed in that order.
  Mr. Burns, immediate past president of the National Guild.

PANEL CONSISTING OF HAYWOOD BURNS, IMMEDIATE PAST
  PRESIDENT, THE NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD; CHRISTOPHER
  F.D. RYDER, MEMBER, ADVISORY BOARD, SUPREME COURT
  WATCH; PAULA L. ETTELBRICK, LEGAL DIRECTOR, LAMBDA
  LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND; URVASHI VAID, EX-
  ECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL GAY AND LESBIAN TASK
  FORCE; AND SARA E. RIOS, STAFF ATTORNEY, CENTER FOR
  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

                     STATEMENT OF HAYWOOD BURNS

   Mr. BURNS. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond,
my name is Haywood Burns. I am the immediate past president of
the National Lawyers Guild and dean of the City University of
New York School of Law at Queens College. I would like to thank
the committee this morning for its opportunity to, on behalf of the
National Lawyers Guild, testify before you in opposition to the
nomination of David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court.

   Mr. Chairman, when Senator Biden at the beginning of these
proceedings on the floor of the Senate indicated that we are at a
constitutional crossroads and that the work of this committee is of
monumental historical importance, it is certainly an observation
with which we agree. He indicated that long after the Mideast
                                              778

crisis and into the next century we will be affected by what hap-
pens in this committee and in the Senate.

  I must say that as we sit here in the last decade of the 20th cen-
tury, on the eve of the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights, we share
this view because we see how many rights of the people hang by
the thread of a 5-4 vote. At this moment in history, the National
Lawyers Guild urges that we need a defender of the Constitution
and of the Bill of Rights. Not a negative standard, not a standard
that looks for the absence of a smoking gun or a paper trail, not is
he or she more confirmable than Judge Bork, we need a positive
standard. We need a standard that speaks to whether or not this
person, he or she, will be a true guardian of our liberties under the
Constitution.

  This is not a partisan issue. It transcends partisan issues. This is
for the good of the Republic and its people. We should keep at it,
Mr. Chairman, until we get it right.

  Would that there were more constitutional scholars here to
inform this process, as there were in the Bork hearings. It is my
understanding that a number of constitutional law professors have
asked to testify before this committee and were informed that they
would not be able to do so, that they could, for whatever reason,
only participate by way of written testimony.

  So you are, therefore, forced to listen to us on this issue of
human rights, and we say to you that because we all here at this
table are involved on a daily basis in the issue of human rights, we
feel it is very important that you not only listen but that you hear.
Our message is that David Souter is not the person for this seat on
the United States Supreme Court.

  The record and the rhetoric do not match. There is a lack of con-
formity between the David Souter that we saw come here on Sep-
tember 13th and the David Souter whose jurisprudence is on the
record for the last 20 years. We ask you to look at the record as
well as listen to the testimony. He was charming, he was disarm-
ing, he spoke in terms of protection of the people's rights, but there
is a record that doesn't conform to that, given his views with re-
spect to due process and limited protections that he is prepared to
give.

  He talked about the first amendment. He talked about church
and state. This is the same David Souter who would defend the
flying of the flag at half-mast on Good Friday as not in violation of
the first amendment.

  He talked about his sensitivities, about his views on equal protec-
tion. Very impressive, but the record does speak about a David
Souter who would obstruct the enforcement of the civil rights stat-
utes by failing to give statistics to the EEOC; a David Souter who
would disenfranchise illiterate citizens in his own State; a David
Souter who would not give rights to Bosselait brothers, poor as
they were, elderly as they were, who without counsel had gone
before the hearing on their workmen's compensation.

  He is a person who has talked about his views on civil rights, but
this is the same David Souter who said in a speech, according to
two newspapers in his own State, that he was against affirmative
action as affirmative discrimination.
                                      779

  I am concerned that he has appeared before this body and said
that in his State he knows of no discrimination. Now, I know New
Hampshire. New Hampshire is a great State, and I spent much
time there, going camping with my boys, Jeremiah and Seth. But
for him to say that in his State or any State in these United States
is free of racism portrays to me a lack of understanding of what
racism is or what discrimination is. It boggles the mind to think
that anyone in this day and time would make that assertion. It
makes me very worrisome concerning his own views about what is
involved in discrimination.

  He has not, in my view, evinced the kind of sensitivity or knowl-
edge or human standing that this position calls for.

  Mr. Chairman, I was not prepared today to make any personal
statement with respect to my own personal knowledge of David
Souter. But after the last witness, let me just say that with all the
respect that I have for Mr. Wesley Williams, whom I have known
for many, many years, I, too, knew David Souter in this period. In
fact, I knew him before Mr. Williams, and just as with Rashamon
or different people who are blind, feeling the elephant, and you
may get a different description of what you see, I did not have that
experience with him. I did not find him mean-spirited. I did not
find him biased. But certainly I did not find that he had any under-
standing of human rights or any concerns expressed in this very
turbulent time when we were in college together, living in the
same dorm, sleeping under the same roof, eating in the same
dining hall for years.

  I have not kept up with him over the years, and I can readily
admit people change. Anyway, this is not a litmus test, but let me
just say that since the committee was given one view, it is only
fair, I feel, that it get another view.

  Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, let me just say that it is too much
to ask that we do justice to the subject of justice in 5 minutes. This
is an awesome task that we have before us. As you can see, I am
an African American. When my grandfather was a boy, it was
against the law of the State where he lived to teach him to read,
and when he was 1-year-old, the Supreme Court said that black
people had no rights that white people are bound to respect.

  A scant 12 years before my father was born, the Supreme Court,
in Plessy v. Ferguson, said that separate but equal, a kind of Ameri-
can apartheid, was the law of the land and did not offend the Con-
stitution. I was 14 years old and in high school before Brown v.
Board of Education was decided to put a crack in that wall of
apartheid condoned in Plessy v. Ferguson, so that I understand that
the Supreme Court has awesome power in our national life. With
that in mind, then I ask this committee to look to the entire
record, not just the rhetoric.

  He asked that we make a leap of faith. That is assuming too
much, I think, because we have too far to fall. It is, in my view,
necessary for this committee to look at 20 years of jurisprudence,
not just what was said in the David Souter that was born on Sep-
tember 13, 1990, in this committee room.

  Yesterday, when I was waiting to testify, I walked 2 minutes
across to First Street, to the Supreme Court, and sat outside and
thought for a while and looked at "Equal Justice Under Law" en-
                                             780

graved above the columns of the Supreme Court, and I wondered
what that will mean for my son and all of my sons and all our sons
and daughters their grandchildren into the next generation, be-
cause that is the impact of the decision that you are about to make.

  I ask that you help give some real meaning to this. It has always
been an aspiration, rather than a reality, but help us live in an
America where we can continue to push forward together to make
that reality something that comes down to the lives of each and
every one of us, whether we are black or white, men or women,
rich or poor, old or young.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                       OPPOSITION TO THE NOMINATION OF DAVID SOUTER
                                       TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

5 5 Avenue of the Americas                      Good afternoon. My name is Haywood Burns. I am immediate past president
       New York, NY 10013              of the National Lawyers Guild and Dean of the City University of New York Law
                212-966-5000           School at Queens College. I want to thank the Committee for allowing me to present
                                       you with the views of the National Lawyers Guild in strong opposition to the
        EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR             nomination of David Souter to the United States Supreme Court. On behalf of the
                    Michael Cowan      Guild's membership in over 200 chapters across the country, I urge that, after careful
                                       consideration of David Souter's jurisprudence, as well as the testimony he has
                       PRESIDENT       provided this committee, you withhold your consent to this nomination. I trust that
                    Debra Evenson      you share with us a concern that any Supreme Court justice be committed to
                                       upholding the rights contained in our Constitution's Bill of Rights, and I urge that you
                       EXECUTIVE       do^not accept a nominee who has not met the burden of demonstrating anything but
              VICE-PRESIDENTS          a life long defense of those rights. Both through his testimony and the record he
                                       brought to these hearings David Souter has not met that burden.
                       Sharron Pitts
                        Brian Spears            Judge Souier's record on the bench, as well as the legacy he left behind in the
                                       New Hampshire Attorney General's office, reveal a jurisprudence of convenience
                      TREASURER        which is grounded in a fundamental misconstruction of the role the Bill of Rights
               Cathleen Connealy       should play in the delicate relationship between government and the governed. What
                                       is more, Judge Souter's answers to your questions over the last few days, to the extent
                       NATIONAL        that iie has provided answers, only confirms this view of the Constitution.
              VICE-PRESIDENTS
                                                David Souter's record reveals a constitutional jurisprudence which fluctuates
                     Charles Brown     depending upon whether he is asked to construe the rights of government or the
                   Paula Ettelbnck     rights of the individual. In Richardson v. Chevrefils. State v. Denny, and Rockhouse
                                       Mountain Property Owners Assoc. v. Town of Conwav. among other cases, Judge
                        Daniel Katz    Souter expressed such an exceedingly narrow view of the due process protections
                     Troy Oechsner     contained in the Fifth Amendment, that the widest expanse of governmental conduct
                                       would be insulated from constitutional scrutiny. Indeed, in State v. Coppola Judge
                        REGIONAL       Souter's construction of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination
              VICE-PRESIDENTS          was rejected when reviewed by the First Circuit Court of Appeals on a habeas corpus
                                       petition brought by the defendant. In a strongly worded opinion, the First Circuit
                             Mideast   wrote that Souter's interpretation of the Fifth Amendment "amounts to a rule of
                  Robin Alexander      evidence whereby inference of guilt will trump a Fifth Amendment claim of the
                                       privilege ... Under the reasoning of the New Hampshire court any invocation of the
                            Midwest    privilege, no matter how worded, could be used by the prosecutor." Fortunately,
                  Barbara Gilchnst     habeas review in federal court of Judge Souter's decision allowed the Bill of Rights
                                       to prevail over prosecutorial overreaching. Ironically this is the same type of federal
                           Northeast   court habeas jurisdiction Judge Souter has testified here that he supports narrowing.

         Contrast Judge Souter's narrow construction of individual rights with his broad reading of the
Bill of Rights when construing the rights of government In United States v. New Hampshire David
Souter argued that requiring the state of New Hampshire to provide racial and ethnic statistical data
to the EEOC amounted to a presumption that the state was guilty of discriminatory hiring practices
in violation of the state's Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. Under David Souter's view of the Bill
of Rights, the state need not produce any information without a showing of probable cause; however,
individuals can be compelled to incriminate themselves and produce physical evidence on less than
a mere suspicion of wrongdoing. His approach time and time again increases the burden on
individuals seeking to vindicate fundamental rights, while granting wide latitude to governmental
action.

         The expedience of his jurisprudence is no better characterized than by his unwillingness to
express an opinion with respect to cases dealing with privacy rights, while displaying no reluctance
in discussing specific voting rights, unemployment compensation or establishment clause holdings.

         The National Lawyers Guild is concerned that in the zeal of the search for Judge Souter's
privacy beliefs, his answers in those areas of law where he has expressed an opinion have been
ignored - areas that are of equal concern to the people who, like women, are not sitting on this
committee. In these answers lie plenty of cause for people of color, poor people, working people,
lesbians and gay men, and unmarried people to reject this nominee.

         Most notably, in response to questioning from Senator Kennedy, Judge Souter reaffirmed his
argument in a voting rights case that extending the franchise to persons who could not read the New
Hampshire Constitution would dilute the voting rights of those who could. He told the Committee
that this was merely a question of math. This mathematical view of the rights secured in the Bill of
Rights exactly mirrors the testimony of Robert Boric Recall that in Bork's view, the recognition of
rights of one group could only come about as a result of the reduction of rights of others. This
closed market view of constitutional rights led to your rejection of Robert Bork; it should do no less
with David Souter.

         Underlying David Souter's jurisprudence is the assumption that the courts represent a level
playing field - that is, that all litigants bring to their disputes comparable resources and power. In
fact, nothing could be farther from the truth. Gender, class, race, age, sexual orientation, physical
or mental ability all bear upon the relative power one can exercise as a litigant. Lost in David
Souter's objective and rarified approach to the law are these real people. For this reason he testified
before you that the New Hampshire literacy tests did not offend the constitution because there was
no evidence that they were discriminatorily applied. This view of equal protection indicates an
unwillingness to recognize that justice is no less offended by policies which are discriminatory in their
effect, than where it results from discriminatory application. As was recently reaffirmed by the
Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1990, that which is neutral on its face can have profoundly
discriminatory implications in its application.

         The National Lawyers Guild strongly urges that the Senate reject this nominee. David Souter
has shown himself lacking in requisite constitutional principles and averse to upholding the rights and
responsibilities contained in our cherished Bill of Rights.

                                                                 -2-

               STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER F.D. RYDER

  Mr. RYDER. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, with
your permission, I would like to submit Supreme Court Watch's
full written testimony for inclusion in the record.

  My name is Chris Ryder. I am an attorney with the law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, in New York City, and
appear before you today on behalf of Supreme Court Watch, a
project of the Nation Institute.

  Supreme Court Watch is dedicated to research on and public edu-
cation about decisions and trends of the Supreme Court. For many
years, Supreme Court Watch has analyzed and reported on the ju-
dicial records of Supreme Court nominees, with particular atten-
tion to their dedication to the protection of civil rights and civil lib-
erties.

  Supreme Court Watch's review of Judge Souter's record and tes-
timony leaves it with questions and concerns in the areas of due
process and equal protection, fourth, fifth, and sixth amendment
protections, reproductive choice, separation of church and state,
and discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age, and sexual
preference. Indeed, Supreme Court Watch is troubled that Judge
Souter's record reflects a relatively narrow and technical regard
for the law with respect to civil liberties.

  Although by his record and testimony, Judge Souter appears well
equipped to handle the complex, technical legal issues that con-
front a Supreme Court Justice, Supreme Court Watch remains con-
cerned that he has demonstrated no clear commitment to uphold-
ing and ensuring the civil rights and civil liberties of all Ameri-
cans. Consequently, Supreme Court Watch believes that the Senate
should decline to confirm his nomination.

  One basis for this conclusion lies in Judge Souter's judicial
record. Although he has testified about his concern for the victims
of crime, neither his record nor his testimony fully appreciates the
distinction between effective law enforcement and upholding the
constitutional guarantees implicated in criminal jurisprudence.

  For example, Judge Souter dissented from a majority opinion of
the Justices rejecting a proposed law permitting the disposal of
blood alcohol evidence, without giving the suspect an opportunity
to test the evidence independently. Judge Souter saw no due proc-
ess interest in requiring that the State preserve this evidence for
possible challenge.

  Further, Judge Souter's views on the writ of habeas corpus, of
profound importance to the Founding Fathers, are unduly restric-
tive. Judge Souter's view that Federal courts should not charge
State courts retroactively with law which, ion his words, was not
there to follow at the time of the State court's judgments, does not
reflect a broader vision that the same constitutional rights identi-
fied in later Federal decisions were fully present at the time of the
State judgments.

  In the <Colbath case, Judge Souter limited the protection afforded
rape victims by New Hampshire's rape shield law, and in so doing,
                                              784

even wrote that the victim might have alleged rape as a way to
excuse, his words, "her undignified predicament."

  Judge Souter's due process and equal protection analysis also
raises concerns about his commitment to furthering civil rights and
civil liberties. In Bosselait, Judge Souter's cramped equal protec-
tion analysis disregarded the compelling facts of this case, and his
testimony has ont allayed any of Supreme Court Watch's concerns
regarding that position.

  Supreme Court Watch is also concerned that Judge Souter joined
in an opinion refusing to follow numerous States in rejecting the
use of sexual orientation as a bar to being an adoptive or foster
parent.

  Perhaps in his prior role, Judge Souter did not have ample op-
portunity to demonstrate a commitment to extending the Constitu-
tion's guarantees to each person in this Nation. However, only last
week, in discussing literacy tests, he characterized the potential
disenfranchisement of countless Americans as nothing more than
"a mathematical statement."

  Moreover, he testified that, at the time he was attorney general,
he personally agreed with New Hampshire's literacy restrictions,
although he now disagrees with those positions.

  Supreme Court Watch fears, as should this committee and the
Senate as a whole, the consequences of entrusting the guarantees
of the Constitution to a man with two circumscribed division of the
democratic process.

  Indeed, now, as the Congress has felt the need to consider civil
rights legislation specifically overruling certain recent Supreme
Court holdings, the Senate should be particularly sensitive to this
nominee's constitutional vision.

  The second area of Supreme Court Watch's concern with this
nomination is Judge Souter's failure to respond to a significant
quantity of legitimate questioning by this committee. Where, as
here, the candidate's judicial record is silent or raises concerns on
important matters, the candidate's testimony becomes especially
significant. Judge Souter has not been as forthcoming as necessary,
and was inconsistent in his choice of subject matters about which
to decline to testify.

  In a concurrence, Judge Souter went out of his way to express
concern for hypothetical physicians' personal feelings about abor-
tions. However, Judge Souter has refused to express any concern
about the real and present legal challenge to well-established Su-
preme Court precedent guaranteeing a woman's constitutional
right to choose, even though he appears to be unconstrained with
respect to such equally vital and unsettled areas as separation of
church and state.

  Judge Souter was willing to discuss Lemon v. Kurtzman and
Judge O'Connor's views on applying its reasoning to recent cases
before the Supreme Court. He expressed his approval of the result
in Employment Division of Oregon, a case decided this year, af-
firmed the principles underlying that decision and specifically
agreed with Justice O'Connor's concurrence.

  Judge Souter gave this testimony, despite his belief at the time
that a motion for rehearing in that case was pending before the
Court, although we believe that that motion was denied in June.
                                      785
This his inconsistent with his refusal to discuss either the constitu-
tional principles underlying Roe v. Wade or the constitutionality of
an intervention in the Korean conflict over 30 years ago, although
it should be noted that he modified his position on the intervention
on Monday, to say that he did not know whether it was consitu-
tional.

  Moreover, Judge Souter declined to discuss before this committee
his personal view of the morality of the right to choose, in contrast,
Justice O'Connor did so and assured the committee that it would
play no role in her legal analysis.

  Judge Souter has stated his personal views on other issues, such
as the morality of the death penalty and white collar crime. It is
difficult to reconcile his apparent willingness to discuss certain
cases, constitutional principles and personal viewpoints, but not
others.

  Mr. Chairman, to conclude, Supreme Court Watch believes that
Judge Souter's record raises numerous concerns regarding his com-
mitment to the protection of civil rights and liberties. His testimo-
ny before this committee has not sufficiently allayed these con-
cerns.

  At a time when major constitutional issues hang in the balance,
Supreme Court Watch cannot, on the available record, support this
nominee.

  Thank you.

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:

        My name is Chris Ryder. I am an attorney in private practice at the law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York City and appear before you today
on behalf of Supreme Court Watch, a project of The Nation Institute. Supreme Court
Watch is dedicated to research on and public education about the decisions and trends
of the Supreme Court. For many years, Supreme Court Watch has analyzed and
reported on the judicial records of Supreme Court nominees, with particular attention to
their dedication to the protection of civil rights and civil liberties. Beginning in 1981, a
representative of the project has appeared before this Committee or submitted written
testimony in connection with the nominations of Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia,
Robert H. Bork and Anthony M. Kennedy.

        We are deeply grateful for the opportunity to testify before you today as you
discharge your constitutional duty of advice and consent. The Senate's decision on this
nominee is likely to have a profound effect on the course this country will follow well into
the next century. Your decision is a matter of the utmost importance to the American
people.

         Our review of Judge Souter's written and oral record and of comprehensive
reports prepared by other organizations leaves us with questions and concerns in the
areas of due process and equal protection, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment
                                       788

protections, reproductive choice, separation of church and state, and discrimination on
the basis of race, gender, age and sexual preference. Indeed, we are troubled that
Judge Souter's record reflects a relatively narrow and technical regard for the law with
respect to civil liberties.

        Although by his record and testimony Judge Souter appears well-equipped to
handle the complex, technical legal issues that confront a Supreme Court Justice, we
remain concerned that he has demonstrated no clear commitment to upholding and
ensuring the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans. Consequently, Supreme Court
Watch believes that the Senate should decline to confirm his nomination.

                                                 *****
Judge Souter's Record and Testimony1

        Supreme Court Watch is troubled by several of Judge Souter's opinions in the
criminal procedure area. Although he has testified about his concern for the victims of
crime, neither his judicial record nor his testimony reflects a full appreciation for the
necessary distinction between effective law enforcement - a police function - and
upholding the constitutional guarantees implicated in criminal law jurisprudence.

        For example, in Opinion of the Justices,2 Judge Souter dissented from a New
Hampshire Supreme Court majority rejecting a proposed law that would have allowed the
state to dispose of blood alcohol evidence without giving the suspect an opportunity to

his nomination, is attached as Annex A to this testimony. We note that this report is not
comprehensive and does not include analysis of his testimony before this Committee.

test the evidence independently. Unlike the majority, Judge Souter found no due process
interest in preserving this evidence for possible later challenge.

         Further, Judge Souter's views on the writ of habeas corpus -- a writ of profound
importance to our Founding Fathers -- will only serve to restrict its usefulness. Judge
Souter's view of the current doctrine of federal collateral relief is that reviewing federal
courts should not charge state courts retroactively with law which "was not there to follow
at the time" of the state court's judgments. Judge Souter fails to appreciate that the same
Constitutional rights, although identified only in later decisions, were in full force and effect
at the time of the state judgments.

         In State v. Colbath,3 on the other hand, Judge Souter granted an accused rapist
a new trial because he considered that evidence of the victim's previous sexual conduct
should have been admissible where consent was a defense. Judge Souter's approach
in this case limited the protection afforded by New Hampshire's "rape shield" law. In what
may at best be described as insensitivity, Judge Souter suggested that the victim might
have alleged rape as a way to excuse "her undignified predicament."

         Judge Souter's due process and equal protection analysis also raises concerns
about his sensitivity and commitment to furthering civil rights and liberties. In Appeal of
Albert & Edward Bosselait* Judge Souter wrote the majority opinion denying a claim for
unemployment compensation by two elderly workers who had shared a full-time janitorial
position for 22 years. Applying the minimal level of scrutiny to the state unemployment

     4547A.2d682 (N.H. 1988).

   39-454--91 26
                                     790

compensation statute, Judge Souter appeared to disregard the exceptional and
emotionally compelling facts of this case in holding that the state could rationally conclude
that it should reserve its funds solely for those seeking full-time employment. Moreover,
Judge Souter's testimony last week did not allay any of our concerns regarding his
position in that case.

        In another area. Judge Souter joined an advisory opinion5 upholding a rigid
exclusion of gay and lesbian persons from adopting children or becoming foster parents
under any circumstances. This opinion failed both to recognize that homosexuals should
be protected from discrimination and to follow the lead of numerous states in rejecting
the use of sexual orientation as an absolute factor in evaluating potential adoptive or
foster parents.

        Perhaps as attorney general and state court judge, David Souter has not had
sufficient opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to extending the Constitution's
guarantees to each and every person in this nation - rich or poor - regardless of race,
gender, age and sexual preference. However, in discussing last week New Hampshire
law that previously made literacy a condition of the right to vote, we are not comforted
by his characterization of the resulting disenfranchisement of countless illiterate Americans
as nothing more than "a mathematical statement."6

         Moreover, in his testimony, Judge Souter affirmed that at the time he took these
actions on literacy as Attorney General, he personally agreed with them, although he then

questioning).

indicated he now disagrees with those positions. We fear, as should this Committee and
the Senate as a whole, the consequences of entrusting the precious guarantees of the
Constitution to a man with too circumscribed a vision of the democratic process. Indeed,
in light of the need for the Civil Rights Act of 1990 specifically overruling certain recent
Supreme Court holdings, Congress should be particularly sensitive to this nominee's
constitutional vision.

Judge Souter's Failure to Respond to Questioning
        Where, as here, the candidate's judicial record is silent or causes concern on

important matters of federal constitutional jurisprudence, the candidate's testimony is of
paramount importance. Judge Souter has not been as forthcoming as necessary. He
has demonstrated wavering forthrightness in his inconsistent choice of subject matters
about which to testify.

         In one of Judge Souter's concurring opinions,7 he went out of his way to express
concern for hypothetical physicians' personal feelings in performing abortions. However,
Judge Souter has absolutely refused to express concern about the real and present legal
challenge to established Supreme Court precedent guaranteeing a woman's constitutional
right to choose. We are troubled by Judge Souter's refusal to respond to questioning
remotely relating to the constitutional principles underlying the right to choose and the
President's right to wage a war not declared by Congress, while he does not appear to
be similarly constrained with respect to equally vital and troubled areas such as

     7Smith v. Cote, 513 A.2d 341 (N.H. 1986).
                                       792

separation of church and state.8
         Judge Souter was forthcoming in his discussion of a number of current matters

of constitutional adjudication, but refused to countenance any discussion of certain
others. For example, Judge Souter was willing to discuss the Lemon v. Kurtzman test
and Justice O'Connor's views on how to apply that test to recent cases before the
Supreme Court. He expressed his approval of the result reached in one such case,
affirmed the principles underlying thai decision and specifically agreed with Justice
O'Connor's concurrence.9 Judge Souter gave this testimony despite his
acknowledgement that a motion for rehearing in that case is pending before the Court.
This is inconsistent with his refusal to discuss the constitutionality of President Truman's
intervention in the Korean Conflict or the principles underlying Roe v. Wade.

        Moreover, Judge Souter declined to discuss his personal view of the morality of
abortion. In contrast, Justice O'Connor disclosed to this Committee her personal view
of abortion and assured the Committee it would not play any role in her legal analysis.
However, Judge Souter has stated some of his personal views on such issues as the
morality of the death penalty. In sum, it is difficult to reconcile his apparent willingness

     The Senate is well within the bounds of propriety to inquire into a candidate's views
on even the most recent constitutional precedents and principles; only the solicitation of
a commitment to vote a certain way on a particular pending case could raise a concern
of prejudice or a requirement for recusal. If the Senate is unable to gain an
understanding of the nominee's views in the area under inquiry, then it cannot effectively
discharge its duty of advice and consent and cannot assent to the nomination.

      Our views on the advice and consent process in the context of this nomination are
attached as Annex B to this testimony.

to discuss certain cases, constitutional principles and personal viewpoints, but not others.
                                                 *****

        Judge Souter's record as Attorney General and as Justice on the New Hampshire
Supreme Court raises numerous concerns regarding his commitment to the protection
of civH rights and civil liberties. His testimony before this Committee has not sufficiently
allayed these concerns. At a time when major Constitutional issues hang in the balance,
Supreme Court Watch cannot, on the available record, support this nominee.

                   to endorse his candidacy at this time.

                   Supreme Court Watch believes that it is incumbent upon
                   the Senate to probe Judge Souter deeply and thoroughly
                   -- perhaps more extensively than it examined Judge Bork,
                   since so much less is known -- in seeking to unearth his
                   judicial philosophy. Only in light of the most thorough
                   examination of Judge Souter's perspectives on
                   fundamental rights, and the Senators' gaining the deepest
                   confidence in his commitment to those rights, should the
                   Senate not reject his nomination.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.

  Paula Ettelbrick, we will be glad to hear from you.

                 STATEMENT OF PAULA L. ETTELBRICK

  Ms. ETTELBRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to the
rest of the committee.

  My name is Paula Ettelbrick. I am the legal director of Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund, a nonprofit legal organization
dedicated to enhancing and promoting the rights of lesbians, gay
men, and people with AIDS in our society. I very much thank the
committee for the opportunity to be heard this morning on issues
of grave concern to us related to the nomination of Judge David
Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Lambda Legal Defense models itself in the fine tradition of our
colleagues of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund,
NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Education Fund, Asian-American Legal Defense Fund,
Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, and others who believe that the
Constitution belongs to the people, that the Constitution belongs to
all of us, that the Constitution does not inherently discriminate
and draw lines between those of us in society who most need its
protections and who are most concerned about our ability to main-
tain our lives, to live our lives under the rule of majoritarian rule.

  We tend to be those constituencies, those citizens of American so-
ciety who most look to the courts as a protector of our rights
against the majority. We tend to be those citizens in the United
States who have the least ability to impact on the majority rule in
our society. Lesbians and gay men, in particular, of all of those
groups tend to still be people who are not able to impact on the
majority, and we look to the Court and to the Constitution, with
grave concern, particularly in light of a nomination to the Supreme
Court.

  Lambda Legal Defense opposes the nomination of David Souter,
primarily because of his participation in a case while on the New
Hampshire Court, called Opinion of the Justice, which is cited in
my testimony. We believe that this committee should give very
close scrutiny to this opinion. It is the one major inroad or insight
into Judge Souter's view of the Constitution. In that opinion, the
court dealt with equal protection, it dealt with the right to privacy,
it dealt with due process, it dealt with the right of assembly, all in
one decision, and we believe that this committee should look at
that decision closely.

  The first question I would ask Judge Souter is whether he wrote
that decision. It was an advisory opinion, it went up to the court at
the request of the New Hampshire Legislature, to try to determine
whether or not the State might adopt a blanket exclusion of lesbi-
ans and gay men from being adoptive or foster parents or from
running day-care centers.

  The court, in its advisory opinion capacity, upheld the bar of
foster and adoptive parenting, upheld the ban that the Legislature
had imposed against lesbian and gay men being able to apply for
adoption.
                                      804
  We feel that the opinion indicated a gross insensitivity and un-
willingness to look at the evidence presented in the case. In Adviso-
ry Opinion, attorneys and other advocates are invited to present
evidence to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, in order to per-
suade them one way or another, and such evidence was presented,
evidence indicating that there is no connection between a parent's
sexual orientation and harm to the child.
  Evidence was presented not only by certain advocates, but, as
well, the majority of the House Judiciary Committee of the New
Hampshire Legislature. Affidavits were submitted by gay and lesbi-
an parents in New Hampshire, criticizing the legislature's ban on
their ability to provide love and support to children. The court
ruled, however, that, despite the overwhelming evidence, despite
the fact that the social science data does not support the notion
that gay and lesbian parents per se make bad parents, per se are
unfit, the court ruled that the statute was constitutional, under
both the Federal and State Constitutions.
  The fear, of course, of the legislature and the fear, of course, of
the New Hampshire Supreme Court was that gay parents might in-
fluence the sexual orientation of their children, a totally discredit-
ed fear and one that is out of sync with the lead of the majority of
States in this country.
  If it were in fact true that parents had such an influence on the
sexual orientation of their children, it would certainly not be the
fact that I was a lesbian or that any other gay person in this coun-
try was a lesbian. I come from parents who are very dedicated to
their heterosexuality, and not ones who necessarily represented
role models otherwise.
  Yet, Judge Souter ascribed to a view of equal protection which
looked only at face value at this legislation and was willing to insti-
tute a total ban against lesbian and gay parenting. Contrary to his
testimony before this committee, where he indicated his willing-
ness and his desire to look at all of the evidence, I think his record
belies his statements to this committee. Had he truly looked at the
evidence, I think Judge Souter would have been persuaded by the
dissent, who recognized in that case that the State is never less hu-
manitarian than when it denies public benefits to a group of citi-
zens, because of ancient prejudice against that group.
  Judge Souter and his colleagues also ruled that gay men and les-
bians are not entitled to due process of law in their applications for
adoption and foster parenting, not entitled to an individual assess-
ment, not entitled to an assessment about their ability to love and
nurture children, to provide financial stability or a home life to
children, education to children, and what have you, per se, gay
men and lesbians, in the view of Judge Souter, are unfit to parent.
  This due process ruling was made, in fact, in light of a previous
New Hampshire Supreme Court decision, holding that a high
school student had a due process right to be heard regarding his
eligibility to compete in sports. Apparently, in New Hampshire,
under David Souter and his colleagues, there is more of a right to
play sports in high school than there is to take on the difficult task
of parenting under the due process clause.
  With regard to privacy, Judge Souter and his colleagues also
ruled that the privacy claim is irrelevant, when an individual vol-
                                      805

untarily requests a public benefit. By relying on the U.S. Supreme
Court decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, decided 4 years ago, in
which the Supreme Court held that lesbians and gay men have no
right to privacy, no right to engage in private adult sexual conduct,
the court confirmed all of our constituency's worst fears, that that
privacy ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in Bowers v. Hardwick
would, in fact, impact on every aspect of our lives.

  No longer would we just be criminals in jurisdictions such as the
District of Columbia and 24 other jurisdictions throughout this
country, but, in fact, that Supreme Court pronouncement would
deny us rights in every facet of our lives, regardless of who we are,
regardless of what facet of our life, whether we are trying to come
into this country as foreigners who happen to be lesbians or gay
men, whether we are trying to serve in the military and serve it
well, whether we are trying to maintain a right to parent and keep
our children, whether we are trying to maintain our right to keep
a job in this society, all such things boil down to only one fact, that
we are nothing more than people who commit crimes against
nature.

  Reliance on stereotype and prejudice against the great weight of
the evidence cannot be tolerated on the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Senator KENNEDY. We will give you just a couple more moments.
  Ms. ETTELBRICK. I am almost done, Senator. Thank you.
  We believe that Judge Souter's reasoning does not affect only les-
bians and gay men, but also women, racial and ethnic minorities
and others for whom prejudice and the burdens of history have
been used to discriminate against us. We are all affected by such a
decision.
  We ask respectfully that this committee consider the fact that
the Bill of Rights does belong to all of us, regardless of who we are,
and that this committee not find in favor of Judge Souter, and, on
fact, oppose the nomination to the Supreme Court.
  Thank you.

        Good afternoon. My name is Paula Ettelbrick. I am the Legal Director for Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, and I want to thank the Committee for allowing me the time to
present Lambda's viewsregardingthe nomination of Judge David Souter to the United States
Supreme Court.

         As an organization that hasfoughtin the courts for seventeen years against discrimination
and prejudicial treatment of gay and lesbian people, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
strongly opposes Judge Soutcr's nomination. Lambda decided to oppose the nomination, only the
second time we have taken such a stand, primarily because of Judge Souter's participation in a
decision of the New Hampshire Supreme Court barring gay men and lesbians from becoming
foster or adoptive parents. Opinion of the Justices. 430 A.2d 21 (N.H. 1987).

         Judge Souter joined three other New Hampshire Supreme Court justices in ruling that the
state's goal of providing a "healthy environment and role model for our children" wa;, a rational
basis upon which to bar all individuals who are gay or lesbian, or who engage in homosexual sexual
conduct, from becoming foster or adoptive parents.1 While we do not argue with the state's goal
in this regard, we strongly object to the court's view that gay people, per se. undercut such goals.
On upholding the law, Judge Soutcr and three of his colleagues relied on the discredited theory
that lesbian and gay parents do not provide appropriate role models because there is a "reasonable
possibility" that they may influence a child's "developing sexual identity."

         Several briefs were submitted to the court presenting evidence to refute the legislature's

Lambda's Opposing Testimony to Sorter's Nomination

role model theory. Most notable was a brief from the Majority of the House Committee on the
Judiciary opposing the constitutionality of the statute in its entirety. Judge Souter and his
colleagues conceded that the evidence before it consisted of "a number of studies that find no
correlation between a homosexual orientation and the sexual orientation of their children." Id. at
25. Yet, the court rejected these studies. Instead, the majority found that since the "source of
sexual orientation is still inadequately understood," the state is allowed to bar the entire class of
lesbians and gay men from these state controlled parenting options. The majority's only support
was one reference to an article noting that environmental conditioning may be one of several
factors in the development of sexual orientation.

          This decision met with the clear disapproval of one dissenting judge, Justice BaicheMer, who
was provoked to remind the court that the "State is never more humanitarian than when it acts
to protect the health of its children. The State is never less humanitarian than when it denies
public benefits to a group of its citizens because of ancient prejudices against that group." Id. at
28. Most importantly, Justice Batchelder exposed the fact that the legislature "received no
meaningful evidence to show that homosexual parents endanger their children's development of
sexual preference...any more than heterosexual parents. The legislature received no such evidence
because apparently the overwhelming weight of professional study on the subject concludes that
no difference in psychological and psychosexual development can be discerned between children
raised by heterosexual parents and children raised by homosexual parents." Id, at 28.2

lambda's Opposing Testimony to Sorter's Nomination

Hampshire Supreme Court, Opinion of the Justices deserves close scrutiny and study with regard
to Judge Souter's approach to individual rights and constitutional guarantees of equal protection,
privacy, due process, and right of assembly. We are deeply concerned about a Supreme Court
nominee who would rely on his own personal outmoded prejudice in order to uphold the state's
rationale for treating gay people as a class different from others, thereby excluding them from
parenting options.

          We are deeply concerned about a judicial nominee who would accept the legislature's
justification of this unequal treatment on the basis of Bowers v. Hardvvick. the Supreme Court
decision allowing states to criminalize homosexual sexual conduct. As pointed out by the dissent,
New Hampshire does not even criminalize homosexual conduct, though it does outlaw heterosexual
adultery. We are gravely concerned about a Supreme Court nominee who would deny an
opportunity for an individual determination of fitness to parent in a state where the courts have
found due process rights for high school students denied the chance to compete in the school
sports program. We are concerned about a nominee who would not look behind an unsupported,
and immediately disprovable, presumption that gay people are unfit to parent in order to allow at
least an individual assessment within a foster care and adoption system which has already instituted
a prnrc<;<; for review of all applicants.

          The majoiity opinion ts unsettling, not simply because of its anti-gay result, but because
of iis hliihe disregard of the'; evidence before the court in favor of hazy stereotypes and outright
prejudice Judge Soutrr and his colleagues opted not to follow the lead of the majority of other
state courts which, like the dissent by Judge Batchclder, reject the use of sexual orientation as a
fidor in evaluating paiental rights. In joining the opinion, or writing it if that is the case, Judge

Lambda's Opposing Testimony to Sontcr's Nomination

Souter indicated his willingness to irrebuttably exclude an entire class of people from the rights,
joys, and benefits based on nothing more than legislators' and individual justices' fears and
stereotypes.

         This kind of judicial reasoning docs not just affect the 25 million gay men and lesbians in
this country. It will harm all racial and ethnic minorities, women, and others who are alienated or
meet with wide-spread social disapproval. These groups, who in combination represent the majority
of people in this country, depend on the courts for protection and enforced fairness. If Judge
Souter was willing to rely on his own stereotypes of gay people in this case, there is no assurance
that he will not reject other evidence and rely again on prejudice or preconceptions when reviewing
cases involving other groups of people.

         If courts will Dot stand up to such state prejudice, and will not vindicate the rights of
minorities and individuals, then the liberty of all is threatened. Certainly gay people need the
pro tec lion of courts willing to give real scrutiny to anti-gay discrimination, rather than declining
to apply the evidence and deferring instead to social hostility, ignorance, and bigotry.

        Lambda Legal Defense believes that the indispensable qualification for an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court is a vigilance on behalf of individual rights and equdl justice Judge Souter's
record makes clear that, by that basic standard, he is unqualified.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Urvashi Vaid. Is that the right pronunciation?

                       STATEMENT OF URVASHI VAID

  Ms. VAID. Actually, it is Urvashi Vaid, but you join an honorable
tradition of people who mispronounce the name.

  Senator KENNEDY. I apologize. Thank you very much.
  Ms. VAID. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of
the committee. My name is Urvashi Vaid, and I am executive di-
rector of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
  On behalf of millions of gay and lesbian Americans, I want to
thank you for this opportunity to testify in opposition to the nomi-
nation of Judge David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is a
membership organization, whose mission is to educate, organize
and advocate for full equality for the 10 percent of the American
population that is estimated to be lesbian and gay.
  The gay and lesbian community seeks from a Supreme Court
nominee nothing more or less than other Americans. We seek a
nominee committed to the concept that the rights embodied in the
Constitution are meant to be inclusive of all Americans.
  Unfortunately, in recent years, the Supreme Court has taken an
increasingly restrictive view of the Constitution's reach in protect-
ing minorities. The Court today fails to countenance the claims of
gay and lesbian Americans who seek basic equal rights that most
Americans take for granted.
  The gay and lesbian plaintiffs who will come before the Supreme
Court in the coming years to vindicate their rights bring stories of
stark and unjust discrimination. I think many on this committee
know better than perhaps some of your colleagues the issues that
we are talking about, pervasive violence, pervasive prejudice, docu-
mented employment discrimination, housing discrimination.
  The plaintiffs who will come before the Supreme Court from my
community will petition for justice, for freedom from unwarranted
governmental intrusion into our private adult lives, for equal pro-
tection, for due process, for the freedom of association that we all
cherish, for the freedom of expression that allows me to sit here
before you, for privacy rights and for other basic constitutional
freedoms that are still denied to gay men and lesbians in this coun-
try.
  Perhaps the most poignant question of constitutional equal pro-
tection I believe the Court will face in the near future will involve
the long-standing efforts of gay and lesbian veterans and members
of the U.S. Armed Forces to end the unjust policy banning openly
gay people from serving our country.
  These courageous men and women are even today stationed on
the front lines in the Middle East, yet we are hunted like criminals
at our home bases in this country, persecuted by our own country,
because of an outdated and needless ban on service by openly gay
and lesbian Americans, which forbids us from contributing our
valor and our talent.
  With this backdrop of interests and concerns, we have considered
Judge Souter's record, in the hope of finding comfort that his defi-
                                      812
nition of American society and his definition of the Constitution
will be inclusive and unbiased.

  We have listened expectantly to his testimony this past week, to
glean hope that the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian Ameri-
cans will be honored by the nominee, and we have come to the
painful conclusion that Judge Souter's record indicates that his
confirmation by this body would not only continue the shameful
denial of equal justice under which gay and lesbian Americans live,
but will do great harm by tilting the Court to the right in critical
areas of civil rights and privacy.

  I want to focus on the foster care and adoptive parenting deci-
sion that my colleague Paula Ettelbrick referred to. Millions of les-
bians and gay men today are parents of children. Whether it is nat-
ural birth parents, adoptive parents, parents by foster care or by
guardianship, lesbian and gay Americans strive to be parents for
the same reasons as our heterosexual counterparts do, and we have
submitted for the record as part of our testimony an excellent arti-
cle which outlines the rights and the lack of rights that gay and
lesbian families encounter in our society.

  This issue is of great concern to my organization and to the
broader gay community. We are very troubled by the fact that
Judge Souter joined in the majority opinion of the New Hampshire
Supreme Court in a decision barring gay and lesbian applicants
from adopting or foster parenting in all circumstances. Again, the
decision is appended as part of our testimony for your consider-
ation.

  The case, as Ms. Ettelbrick pointed out, centered on the constitu-
tionality of a proposed New Hampshire law that would have
banned all gay people from becoming adoptive of foster parents
and from operating child care agencies.

  The majority of the State court held that the exclusion of gay
people from parenting was a reasonable legislative response to the
bill's stated concern of providing "appropriate role models for chil-
dren." While the court struck down the portion of the law banning
us from operating child care agencies, the proposed ban on all par-
enting through adoption or foster care programs was passed by the
New Hampshire Legislature.

  We are very concerned that Judge Souter ignored the record in
that case. It was an extensive record. I was pleased to hear Senator
Heflin ask the question on Monday afternoon of Judge Souter
about the record in that case, and contrary to Judge Souter's asser-
tion that there was not enough evidence, indeed there was in the
written submissions made by a variety of parties and in the conclu-
sion of the House Judiciary Committee itself.

  The dissenting judge noted that, indeed, the overwhelming
weight of the professional study on the subject concludes that there
is no difference in psychological and psychosexual development be-
tween children raised by heterosexual parents and children raised
by homosexual parents.

  I know that my time is short before you, so I want to switch
focus from Judge Souter's ignoring of the record and participating
in a biased holding in that foster care case, to some privacy con-
cerns that we also share with our colleagues.
                                      813
  Like other constituencies concerned about the future Supreme
Court's handling of the tested constitutional right to privacy, we
have considered his record on testimony and privacy doctrine with
great interest, and again, these confirmation hearings have offered
little solace to gay and lesbian Americans concerned with securing
our freedom from inappropriate and discriminatory State regula-
tion of our private lives.
  In his testimony before this committee, the Judge commented
that he believes in a constitutional right to privacy, a fundamental
right to privacy for married couples. As I am sure you know, this
narrow statement would be a step backward from the current
status of the privacy doctrine, where the Court has recognized the
broadest right in situations involving unmarried persons, as well.
  Judge Souter's testimony on privacy also contained his repeated
claim to listen to the other side. We respectfully submit that listen-
ing without any willingness to change one's position is not helpful
to those of us who seek a more expansive interpretation of privacy.
  Mr. Chairman, the coming decades will continue to witness the
further advancement toward equality of lesbian and gay Ameri-
cans. We believe that we and all Americans will benefit from a Su-
preme Court committed to just and equitable application of basic
constitutional principle, and a court committed to extending the
reach of the Constitution to encompass all segments of society.
  For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to vote against the
nomination of Judge Souter.
  Thank you for your consideration.

            Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Urvashi
Vaid and I am executive director of the National Gay & Lesbian Task
Force. On behalf of millions of gay and lesbian Americans, I want
to thank you for this opportunity to testify in opposition to the
nomination of Judge David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Founded
in 1973, the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force is a membership
organization whose mission is to educate, organize and advocate for
full equality for the 10 percent of the American population that is
lesbian and gay.

         The gay and lesbian community seeks from a Supreme Court
nominee nothing more or less than other Americans: we seek a
nominee committed to the concept that the rights embodied in the
Constitution are meant to be inclusive of all Americans.

         Unfortunately, in recent years, the Supreme Court has taken an
increasingly restrictive view of the Constitution's reach in
protecting minorities. The Court today fails to countenance the
claims of gay and lesbian Americans who seek basic equal rights
which most Americans take for granted. The gay and lesbian
plaintiffs who come before the Court bring stories of stark and
unjust discrimination. They petition for justice, for freedom from
unwarranted governmental intrusion into private, consensual adult
sexual expression, for equal protection, due process, freedom of
association, freedom of expression, privacy, and for the basic
constitutional freedoms guaranteed to all other Americans.

         Perhaps the most poignant question of constitutional equal
protection the Court will confront in the near future involves the
long-standing efforts of gay and lesbian veterans and members of
the U.S. Armed Forces to end the unjust policy banning openly gay
and lesbian people from serving our country. These courageous men
and women are even today stationed on the front lines in the Middle
East, yet they are hunted like criminals at their home bases;
persecuted by their own country because an outdated and needless
ban on service by gay and lesbian Americans forbids us from
contributing our valor and talent.

         With this backdrop of interests and concerns, we have
considered Judge Souter's record in the hope of finding comfort
that his definition of American society and the Constitution is
inclusive and unbiased. We have listened expectantly to his
testimony this past week to glean hope that the Constitutional
rights of gay and lesbian Americans will be honored by the nominee.
And we have come to the painful conclusion that Judge Souter's
record indicates that his confirmation by this body will not only
continue the shameful denial of equal justice under which gay and
lesbian Americans live, but will do great harm by tilting the Court
to the right in critical areas of civil rights and privacy.

         In our written submission to this committee, we have addressed
 our concerns about privacy rights, and the impact of this
 nomination on the future Court's reconsideration of the anti-gay,
 Bowers v. Hardwick Georgia sodomy law decision. Hardwick
 constricted the freedom from inappropriate government regulation of
 private sexual and reproductive decisions which all Americans
 cherish.

         Also in our written submission to this committee, we have
 drawn your attention to a New Hampshire case which gravely, and we
 believe unconstitutionally, restricted opportunities to qualified
 gay and lesbian applicants seeking to become parents through
 adoption or foster care. We have submitted for the record an
 analysis of the legal status of lesbian and gay families today
                                     816

prepared by highly respected author and attorney, Roberta
Achtenberg.

         I want to focus my testimony today on the New Hampshire case
in which Judge Souter, sadly, joined a majority in denying
constitutional due process to gay and lesbian residents of the
state of New Hampshire by upholding a law that barred gay and
lesbian applicants from adopting or foster parenting in all
circumstances. The case was entitled Opinion of the Justices. 525
A.2d 1095 (N.H. 1987).

         In 1987, the New Hampshire legislature sought an advisory
opinion from the state supreme court on the constitutionality of a
bill that would have banned all lesbian and gay applicants from
becoming adoptive or foster parents and from operating child care
agencies. The majority of the state court, of which Judge Souter
was a part, held that the exclusion of all gay and lesbian
prospective parents from foster parentage and adoption programs was
a reasonable legislative response to the bill's stated concern of
providing "appropriate role models for children." Id., at 1099.
While the Court struck down the portion of the law that would have
forbidden gay or lesbian persons from operating child care
agencies, the proposed ban on parenting options was subsequently
passed by the legislature.

         As dissenting Judge Batchelder noted, the majority opinion was
reached despite the fact that there was no evidence in the record
to support it. Indeed, there was evidence in the record which
contradicted the majority's conclusion.

         We are deeply concerned that Judge Souter participated in a
holding based on no substantial record, but on prejudicial and
stereotyped myths about gay men and lesbians. Significant court
precedent from other jurisdictions in custody cases and other
parenting cases involving foster care and adoption exists to
challenge the legal reasoning and holding in the New Hampshire
Supreme Court case.

         In addition, Judge Souter's participation in a holding not
based on the record leaves us uncomfortable with his repeated
assertions during his testimony before this committee, assertions
that he would be an open-minded judge, who will listen to both
sides before he acts, and who will base his decisions on the facts
and not on his personal views.

         Finally, Judge Souter and the majority's holding in the case
denied constitutional due process to gay and lesbian plaintiffs by
upholding a law whose sole standard for allowing access to adoption
or foster care rights was the applicant's sexual orientation.

         The next two decades will witness the continued advancement
towards equality of lesbian and gay Americans. We believe that we
and all Americans will benefit from a Supreme Court committed to
just and equitable application of basic Constitutional principle,
a Court committed to extending the reach of the Constitution to
encompass all segments of society.

         In light of the record we have presented for you in our
testimony, and in the absence of convincing evidence that he will
equitably apply constitutional principles to gay and lesbian
plaintiffs and respondents he would encounter as a Supreme Court
justice, we respectfully urge you to vote against Judge Souter's
confirmation.

           Thank you for your consideration.

Introduction
        The Coalition for a Just Supreme Court emphatically rejects

the nomination of David Souter to the Supreme Court of the United
States. David Souter is unfit for the nation's highest court:
his performance as judge and Attorney General1 demonstrates an
inherent hostility and insensitivity to the rights of most
Americans -- namely, working people, women, people of color, gay
men and lesbians, immigrants, poor people, and criminal
defendants.

        Moreover, David Souter is hostile to the Constitution
itself, and to the precious doctrine of "liberty and justice for
all." Unlike Justice Brennan, David Souter does not regard the
Constitution as a "living, breathing document" through which the
conditions of our changing and diverse society must be examined.
Rather, David Souter would further constrict fundamental rights:
to him, what comes first are the needs of a few, and what is
sacrificed are the needs of many. Time and time again, Souter
has protected the interests of the wealthy over the needs of the

         1 David Souter's tenure as Attorney General of the State of
New Hampshire is an appropriate area of inquiry because the
attorney general does not serve at the pleasure of the Governor in
New Hampshire. Indeed, there is a significant precedent in the
state for the attorney general to,refuse to defend or enforce the
Governor's agenda in the case of a political or legal disagreement.
For this reason, the New Hampshire Governor has his or her own
counsel. Significantly, David Souter's predecessor in the attorney
general's office, now-Senator Warren Rudman, frequently refused the
direction of then-Governor Peterson. Consequently, David Souter's
performance as attorney general is not shielded from inquiry on the
theory that he was only acting as an agent of the governor; rather
he bears accountability for his actions during that period.
                                     820

poor; time after time, he has championed the destructive notion
of "reverse discrimination" rather than sought to redress the
impact of racism. His record demonstrates a proclivity to
identify only with the litigant most similar to himself. As
such, he identified exclusively with anti-choice physicians
rather than the right of women to control their bodies. Souter
is hardly a "blank slate": his record shows ample evidence of a
judicial activist bent on subjugating the Constitution to the
will of a privileged few.

        As a judge, David Souter has forged a "jurisprudence of
convenience", in which he blows in one judicial direction and
then quite nimbly in another. When it serves his end, he is a
strict constructionist as in the case of In Re Dionne. where he
rejected a constitutional challenge to court fees on the basis of
a reading of the New Hampshire Constitution as it was understood
in 1784, yet in U.S. v. N.H. he invoked a radical theory of the
right to privacy in order to withhold demographic information
from the EEOC. When push comes to shove, however, when the
rights of individuals are weighed against those of the State, the
State wins.

        Judge Souter has also demonstrated a jurisprudence inimical
to the Constitution. Whenever possible, he has avoided the
affirmation of constitutional rights by shifting the focus of
attention from public to private actors, and by construing
constitutional claims as "mere" statutory rights. In so doing,
he has shown himself unwilling to recognize that the rights
                                    821

secured in the Constitution are paramount to the will and whim of
particular legislatures.

         Our analysis reveals that Souter has little idea what the
courts have to do with justice. To him, adept legal phrasing and
esoteric arguments mean more than the conditions of real people's
lives. Like many conservatives, he appears to believe that all
litigants come to court on a level playing field, despite
different life experiences. He does not recognize the differences
between the experiences of men and women, between people of color
and white people, between gay men and lesbians and the
heterosexual majority, between the poor and the wealthy, between
the able bodied and the disabled, and between the young and the
elderly. Rather than viewing diversity as something which
enriches society, his record shows that at best he views equal
opportunity as a burden and an inconvenience, and that
affirmative action in his eyes is affirmative discrimination.
Rather than using law to implement a truly humane vision of
justice, he manipulates legal theory to mete out a desiccated
intellectual notion of "justice" as if it were unrelated to
social conditions. At best, he is insensitive; at worst, he
furthers the limitations of a society steeped in many
unacceptable biases. We deeply object to Souter's approach to
the law, which is dehumanizing and out of touch with the
complexities of our society.

         We urge the Senate to reject David Souter. We need not
await artful dodging of tough questions; we have enough

                                      822

information to know where this nan stands.

                                             WOMEN'S RIGHTS
         Souter's record in areas that directly and uniquely affect
women's lives is cause for great alarm. In cases involving
economic rights, abortion, family law, and constitutional equal
protection, David Souter has distinguished himself with a
penchant for stereotype, arcane notions of gender and a laissez-
faire notion of justice. Indeed, Souter's myopic view of the
Constitution inevitably leads to a world outlook where women are
unequal players to men because they are invisible or
inconsequential. This makes perfect sense given his insistence
upon construing the Constitution in terms that were relevant in
the 1790's -- a time when the interests and concerns of women
were never brought to the table. This philosophy is not
acceptable in a judge who will sit on the court into the twenty-
first century.
         This hostility to recognizing the oppression of women was
made quite clear in Helaemos v. Meloon, in which he asked the
U.S. Supreme Court to reduce the standard under which laws that
discriminate against women are examined under the Constitution.
Souter argued that the intermediate scrutiny standard developed
by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren would "permit subjective
judicial preferences and prejudices." In other words, the courts
should not impose a constitutional check on the judgments of
legislators even if that legislative judgment amounted to
                                    823

flagrant sex discrimination.
        With respect to reproductive rights, Souter has made it

quite clear that in considering the issue, the interests of women
will be far from his mind. In Smith v. Cote and in a letter he
authored to the legislature when he was on the Superior Court
regarding judicial by-pass provisions of a parental consent law,
Souter was concerned not with the hardships faced by pregnant
young women, or women who have received inadequate prenatal care,
but rather with the problems faced by anti-choice judges or
doctors -- that is, the people on the periphery of these issues,
who happen to be the people with whom he could most identify with
personally.

        His insensitivity to women's lives was made further manifest
in New Hampshire v. Colbath. a rape case in which Souter found
that the defendant had a right to have the jury consider the
victim's "sexually provocative behavior" toward other men present
just prior to the rape, which he considered relevant to the issue
of consent. He held that perhaps the victim falsely accused the
defendant of rape as a way to excuse her "undignified
predicament."

         Souter is more than a conservative judge. He is a judge who
apparently believes that some of the most perplexing
constitutional issues of our time should be decided solely by
reference to the thinking of men in 1784. This posture has
dramatic negative implications for equal protection, due process
and privacy rights. Most importantly, this record demonstrates
                                    824

that Judge Souter is wholly unfit to sit on the U.S. Supreme
Court.

                               RIGHTS OF LESBIANS AMD GAY MEM
         In a decision that is steeped in stereotype and draconian
notions of family, David Souter joined an advisory opinion of the
New Hampshire Supreme Court which upheld the legislature's
declaration that gay men and lesbians are per se unfit to be
foster care or adoptive parents. In Opinion of the Justices, a
majority of the court found that the proposed law did not run
afoul of the due process, equal protection, privacy and freedom
of association provisions of the federal and state constitutions.

         By taking this position, Judge Souter and his colleagues
ignored the majority of legal precedent on this issue which has
rejected the use of sexual orientation as a factor in evaluating
parental rights. The opinion in which Souter joined reasoned
that the state has a legitimate interest in assuring heterosexual
role models for children, and that the exclusion of lesbians and
gay men from foster or adoptive parenting would further this
purpose. The court's decision relied on the universally
discredited theory that there is a "reasonable possibility" that
having a gay or lesbian parent might affect a child's "developing
sexual identity." The court conceded that there have been "a
number of studies that find no correlation between a homosexual
orientation of parents and the sexual orientation of their
                                    825

children." Nevertheless, the court rejected these studies and
concluded that since the "source of sexual orientation is still
inadequately understood," the state could exclude lesbians and
gay men from these parenting options because they are not
appropriate role models.

        While this opinion represents a profound assault on the
rights of lesbians and gay men, its constitutional analysis is
equally troublesome for all people, regardless of sexual
orientation. In finding that the proposed law did not run afoul
of the state and federal constitution, the court found that it
deserved only a minimal level of scrutiny because there is no
fundamental right to parent. Souter and his colleagues reasoned
that the "mere expectation" of parenting created by the state's
foster care and adoption laws did not rise to the level of a
right protected by either the due process or equal protection
clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The
offensiveness of this argument is made manifest by Judge
Batchelder's dissent, in which he observed that existing New
Hampshire constitutional law recognized a liberty interest in
access to interscholastic sports sufficient to trigger
constitutional due process protections, while the Souter majority
refused to find that "parenting is so ingrained in our culture
that to deny the opportunity to adopt or provide foster care is a
deprivation of liberty." Indeed, the majority opinion was so
insensitive that it provoked Justice Batchelder to write that
"the state is never less humanitarian than when it denies public
                                    826

benefits to a group of citizens because of ancient prejudices
against that group."

                                      CIVIL RIGHTS AND LABOR
         Of one thing we can be sure -- once on the Supreme Court,
David Souter would roll back much of the gains of the Civil
Rights and labor movements by gutting Title VII and the rights of
working people.
        U.S. v. State of New Hampshire. Souter led a challenge to a
federal requirement that public employers provide the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) with annual reports
setting out the racial and ethnic make-up of their employees.
These reports were mandated as part of the EEOC's monitoring of
compliance with Title VII's non-discrimination in employment
provisions.
         In his 1st Circuit Court brief Souter insisted that the
collection of statistics was irrelevant to the enforcement of
rights under Title VII and argued, instead, that the reporting
requirements could only result in the "enforcement of racial
quotas." In essence, Souter believed so little in the state's
ability to employ non-discriminatory hiring practices, that
resort to racial quotas would be the only way to avoid a racially
imbalanced workforce.
        Most surprisingly, Souter put forward a radical privacy
theory in defense of the state's resistance to reporting the
racial and ethnic makeup of its workforce. He argued that the
collection of this information was just as offensive to the

                                                  8
                                    827

employee's privacy rights as inquiring of employees about the
"frequency with which [they] have psychiatric treatment or the
frequency with which they have sexual relations." Further,
Souter had the gall to invoke the Constitution's anti-slavery
protections by arguing that the classifications required by the
EEOC constituted "badges and incidents of slavery" contrary to
the mandates of the 13th Amendment.

         Finally, in a shameful display of insensitivity and
ignorance, Souter presented complicated theories of racial
identity in an attempt to obscure the need to gather
racial/ethnic data essential to the successful enforcement of the
law's anti-discrimination provisions. For example, Souter asks
hypothetically, how do you classify a Mexican-American woman who
looks Caucasian but identifies herself as Chicana? Or a Native-
American man who does not appear Caucasian but identifies with
his own Caucasian parent more than with his Native American
parent?

         Perhaps most interesting about this case is the fact that
after losing in the 1st Circuit, Souter petitioned for certiorari
to the U.S. Supreme Court; and the petition was opposed by none
other than Robert Bork, the Solicitor General at the time.

                                   DAVID 80PTER IB ANT I LABOR
         If David Souter's nomination to the United States Supreme
Court is confirmed, he will undoubtedly assist big business in
its campaign to roll back the New Deal and to destroy employees'
      828

gains in wages, hours, working conditions and the ability to
organize.

        Just as in other areas of the law, Judge Souter's
jurisprudential vision naively or disingenuously assumes that
litigants are equally equipped to compete in the courtroom and in
society. His judicial philosophy is a product of Adam Smith's
18th century economics with its fiction that we enter the job and
consumer arenas as equals. Souter can be viewed as a neutral
arbiter only in the context of the hypothetical world of the
"level playing field."

        His New Hampshire judicial opinions indicate that he is
either covertly pro-employer or dangerously unaware of the
realities of the job market and the workplace.

        When Judge Souter denied unemployment compensation benefits
to two elderly disabled brothers who had been laid off after 22
years of employment, he wrote an opinion that reveals the depth
of his insensitivity to people who enjoy less privilege than he
does. Souter refused to consider whether the state's
unemployment compensation law discriminated against disabled and
elderly workers because the brothers had not raised the .
discrimination issues at the trial. Souter resorted to this
procedural escape valve to avoid considering the discrimination
claims even though the brothers had no legal assistance at the
trial, and the statute was discriminatory on its face. Appeal of

commitment to real justice.

                                              VOTING RIGHTS
         In 1970, while Souter was Assistant Attorney General to
Warren Rudman he argued U.S. v New Hampshire, a case he recently
singled out as one of the most gratifying cases in which he had
ever been involved. In that case the United States, pursuant to
the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, sought to enjoin

                                                        11
                                     830

New Hampshire's use of a literacy test mandated by the state
constitution and statutes which conditioned the right to vote on
one's ability to read and write the New Hampshire constitution in
English. Unlike many states that stopped using literacy tests
and other devices once notified by the U.S. Department of Justice
of the illegality of such tests after passage of the Voting
Rights Act, David Souter, on behalf of New Hampshire, vigorously
fought for the right to continue using the literacy test.

         In his brief, Souter argued vehemently that the rights of
the State to determine voter qualifications and the rights of
literates are constitutional, while the rights of illiterates2
are "merely legal." He maintained that because illiterate people
"can claim...no more than that they are the fortuitous and
incidental beneficiaries of a legal, rather than a
constitutional, right to vote" and because "the claims of the
State and hence of its literate voters, are of constitutional
proportions," the risk of harm is greater to the State and its
literate voters. In fact, he argued that since it was virtually
impossible for the state to provide a means whereby illiterate
voters could vote "intelligently," their votes would result in
"watering the value of every literate citizen's vote ...."

         Given the history of limited access to and inadequate
education as well as the social oppression of the poor and people

          Note that "illiterate" for these purposes means all persons
who cannot read and write the New Hampshire Constitution. Such an
overbroad definition of the term may very well draw within its
scope a majority of residents of the state.

                                                        12
                                     831

of color in this country, Souter's attempt to prevent
"illiterates" from voting amounts to an attempt to prevent the
poor and people of color from voting. At best, his argument
indicates either an unacceptable insensitivity to U.S. socio-
economic conditions, while at worst it represents an unacceptable
racist and classist ideology.

        Although the brief in this case had both Rudman and Souter's
names on it, the fact that Souter argued it is a strong
indication that he wrote it too. What is more alarming is that
in his Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire, Souter wrote
that "participation in the argument of that case [was] one of the
most gratifying events of my life" because "the argument included
a genuinely dialectical exchange between the great jurist [Judge
Gignoux] and me." He sees the case as a mere intellectual
exercise and has no sense for the erosion of civil rights that
the views expressed in his brief represent.

    SOUTER'S RECORD ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT TO DISSENT
         An examination of Souter's judicial record reveals a man who

belittles the rights of the accused and is oblivious to the
courts' role in guarding against police misconduct.

         Under New Hampshire law, if the police take blood or breath
or urine samples from someone accused of drunken driving, the
police must make an identical sample available to the accused for
independent testing. In 1989, the legislature asked for the state
Supreme Court for an advisory opinion as to whether it would be

                                                        13
                                      832

constitutional to repeal the two-sample law.
         The majority of the Supreme Court said that repealing the

two-sample law would turn DWI arrests into unconstitutional
violations of suspects1 due-process rights.

         Souter and another judge joined in a dissent, which
concluded that the proposed change would be constitutional. Their
dissent turns the presumption of innocence on its head by stating
that the chances are "extremely low11 that a second sample would
be helpful to the defendant because the police would not take any
samples if they did not have good reason to believe that the
accused was drunk. The dissent also asserted, without
explanation, that two samples were not necessary because the
accused could have a second sample taken at his/her own expense.
Opinion of the Justices. 557 A. 2d 1355 (N.H. 1989).

         In another Supreme Court decision, Souter wrote a majority
opinion that seriously undermines the Miranda protection against
involuntary self-incrimination. Souter wrote that when a
defendant refused to answer questions by declaring "... if you
think I'm going to confess to you, you're crazy," the refusal
itself was admissable as evidence of a guilty conscience. State
v. Coppola. 536 A. 2d 1236 (N.H. 1987). The 1st Circuit reversed
Souter in a strongly worded opinion which observed that Souter's
interpretation of the Fifth Amendment "amounts to a rule of
evidence whereby inference of consciousness of guilt will trump a
fifth amendment claim of the privilege ..." Under the reasoning
of the New Hampshire court any prearrest invocation of the

                                                        14
                                    833

privilege, no matter how worded, could be used by the prosecutor.
        When Souter was New Hampshire Attorney General, he exhibited

extreme antipathy for the rights of political dissenters in his
treatment of the environmental protesters at the Seabrook nuclear
power plant construction site. Beginning in 1976, when Souter was
Attorney General and New Hampshire's chief law enforcement
officer, the State Police initiated a full-time undercover
operation against the Clamshell Alliance, which continued at
least until 1981. State police agents and paid informers
regularly attended Clamshell meetings and reported their
observations to the police, in apparent violation of the
Clamshell members' First Amendment rights.

         Souter has stated he had no knowledge of the undercover
operation, but the chief of undercover operations for the police
has testified in a deposition that he sent his reports on the
operation to the Attorney General's office. Whatever the state of
Souter's knowledge of the police spying on the Clamshell
Alliance, his behavior raises grave doubts about the judgement of
a high official who would give the police unbridled authority to
prejudice the First Amendment rights of political protesters.

         Similar doubts are raised about the judgement of Attorney
General Souter in May 1977, during large-scale civil disobedience
actions at Seabrook. As a result of a series of decisions by
Souter, more than 1400 demonstrators were arrested and held,
contrary to normal New Hampshire practice, without the
opportunity to be released on their personal recognizance. Since

Souter had made no preparations to hold so many prisoners, the
protesters were detained in grossly substandard conditions in
makeshift jails.

                                                CONCLUSION
        Although David Souter has been presented to the American
public as a "blank slate" and a brilliant jurist, the facts
demonstrate otherwise. He is no blank slate, and his
jurisprudence betrays a startlingly limited vision. Whether
Souter is brilliant or dull, what is at issue is his approach to
the Constitution and the liberties it protects. Souter's record
as Attorney General and judge displays an aversion to those
rights which are the cornerstone of a healthy, diverse, and just
society.

  Ms. Rios. Good morning. My name is Sara Rios and I speak here
today on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights. The center
is a civil rights organization, with a 24-year history of litigating
constitutional issues to protect the rights of the poor and the op-
pressed, and to check excesses of government power.
  Standing on that record, Senators, we urge you today to resound-
ingly reject David Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court.
  Senators, the decision you are about to make is the single most
significant decision to affect people's rights in decades. We believe
that a consolidation of a conservative majority on the Court has se-
riously eroded individual rights, and that there is great danger
that the U.S. Supreme Court will no longer stand as the insurer of
equal justice for all.
  With so much hanging in the balance, we urge you to focus on
whether the nominee s life experience and legal record affirmative-
ly demonstrate a concrete commitment to equal justice. You must
apply a positive standard for justice and liberty, not a negative
standard, framed around the ideological brashness of Robert Bork.
You must apply a positive standard to reflect the role of the Su-
preme Court, as contemplated by the Bill of Rights and the civil
rights amendments, that of a champion of minority rights over ma-
joritarian oppression and inequitable legislation.
  David Souter's history is clear, when it comes to civil rights: One
need not look very deeply into his writings and the now famous lit-
eracy test case and title VII case, to see that Souter has no under-
standing of the experiences of people different from himself. It is
outrageous and it is offensive to suggest that, after confirmation,
David Souter visit an Indian reservation to raise his consciousness
about racial diversity.
  One need not look very deeply into his advisory opinion on gay
and lesbian parenting, to see Souter's repressive traditionalism vis-
a-vis the family and civil rights. We caution you to beware of the
confirmation conversion which David Souter has skillfully tried to
exhibit in the past few days. David Souter has succeeded in not an-
swering most of your questions, but he has bandied about liberal
rhetoric with great facility, as if the mere use of the words such as
"privacy" and "affirmative action," or even his apparent support
for Miranda rights, can undo 20 years of attacking civil rights from
the bench and as attorney general.
  Unfortunately, the debate about Judge Souter's fitness has been
framed not by his record, but by a negative standard set by the
nomination of Robert Bork. It is not enough that a nominee merely
agree with the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, for
example. A nominee must demonstrate nothing less than a lifelong
commitment to an involvement in making this country a safe and
welcoming environment for those who are most oppressed. David
Souter has no such history.
  Let us not think that this man is a friend of women's rights, be-
cause David Souter refers to marital privacy as a liberty. This is
especially so, since he has not been pressed on its implications for
marital rape and men's attempts to control women's reproductive
freedom within marriage.
  Let us not be fooled by his characterization of himself as a hired
gun for the Governor, when he was attorney general. Our research
                                      836

shows unequivocally that the New Hampshire attorney general can
play a role which is entirely independent from the Governor.

   Let us not be fooled by David Souter's testimonial utterances
that he abhors discrimination, when in the same breath he also
said that there is no longer any discrimination in New Hampshire,
a remark which bespeaks the insensitivity with which he has han-
dled these issues throughout his career.

   It is not enough for David Souter to simply deny that he ever re-
ferred to affirmative action as affirmative discrimination, when in
his title VII brief he freely quoted from a book entitled "Affirma-
tive Discrimination" to advance his arguments that the State \
should not be compelled to collect statistics for the EEOC.

   Seventeen years after Roe v. Wade, it is untenable for David
Souter to avoid stating his position on that landmark case, just as
in 1971 it would have been unthinkable for a nominee to be uncer-
tain or secretive of the wisdom of the 1954 Brown decision.

   Moreover, it is unacceptable for a nominee to be uncertain of his
feelings about cases he handled as attorney general in which he
demonstrated particular disregard for civil rights.

   Many vital cases will be decided soon by the Supreme Court. For
example, the Johnson Controls case, a discriminatory employment
policy directed against women in that case and masquerading as an
occupational health policy, threatens to set a dangerous precedent
for the elimination of women from the industrial workforce.

  Additionally, the Court will no doubt address the recently passed
Americans With Disabilities Act and the regressive sections of the
McCarran-Walter Act, which exclude people from this country,
simply on the basis of their political affiliations.

  Most frightening, Senators, that Court will review your delibera-
tions on the 1990 Civil Rights Act. Negative decisions in these cases
will have dire and direct consequences on your constituencies and
will have a disproportionate effect on people of color and the poor,
signalling a retreat from progress and equal justice.

  Senators, the U.S. Supreme Court is at a critical juncture. We
submit to you that the current conservative majority on the
Court--and David Souter, the nominee currently before you--are
out of touch with the profound aspirations of people of color, of
women, and of many others to attain the fundamental rights that
are guaranteed them by the Bill of Rights.

  The Senate possesses a,grave duty to examine thoroughly the
qualifications and mindset of this nominee to the Supreme Court.
Because Judge Souter has betrayed himself in these hearings as a
jurist whose positions are inimical to the Bill of Rights, we strongly
urge you to reject him and to press for a nominee who stands tall
enough to hold high the banner of equal justice. We urge you to
take on this fight and to engage in this heroic battle. History will
not forgive us if we do not try. Otherwise, it will be said that on
the eve of the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights, you, the elected
representatives of the people, forgot that freedom must be won
anew, and by extraordinary efforts, in every generation.

         Good afternoon. I am Sara E. Rios, speaking on behalf of the
Center for Constitutional Rights, a civil rights organization with
a 24-year history of litigating constitutional issues to protect
the rights of the poor and the oppressed, and to check excesses of
government power. We urge the Senate to resoundingly reject David
Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court.

         Senators, the decision you are about to make is the single
most significant decision to affect peoples1 rights in decades.
We believe that the consolidation of a conservative majority on the
Court has seriously eroded individual rights, and that there is
great danger that the United States Supreme Court will no longer
stand as the insurer of equal justice for all.

        With so much hanging in the balance, we urge you to focus on
whether the nominee's life experience and legal record
affirmatively demonstrate a concrete commitment to equal justice.
You must apply a positive standard for justice and liberty, not a
negative standard framed around the ideological brashness of a
Robert Bork. You must apply a positive standard to reflect the
role of the Supreme Court as contemplated by the Bill of Rights and
Civil Rights Amendments -- that of a champion of minority rights
over majoritarian oppression and inequitable legislation.

            David Souter's history is clear when it comes to civil
rights: one need not look very deeply into his writings in the now-
famous literacy test case and Title VII case to see that Souter has
no understanding of the experiences of people different from
himself. One need not look very deeply into his advisory opinion
on gay and lesbian parenting to see Souter's repressive
                                      839

traditionalism vis a vis the family and civil rights.
             We caution you to beware of the "confirmation conversion"

which David Souter has skillfully tried to exhibit in these past
few days. Souter has succeeded in not answering most of your
questions; but he has bandied about liberal rhetoric with great
facility, as if the mere use of words such as "privacy" and
"affirmative action" undoes thirty years of attacking civil rights
from the bench and as Attorney General. Unfortunately, the debate
about Souter's fitness has been framed not by Souter's record, but

of the wisdom of the 1954 Brown decision. Moreover, it is
unacceptable for a nominee to be uncertain of his feelings about
cases he handled as Attorney General in which he demonstrated
particular disregard for civil rights.

          Many vital cases will be decided soon by the Court. For
example, in Rust v. Sullivan, if the government regulations are
upheld, restrictions on abortion counseling in Title X clinics will
limit women's freedom of reproductive choice by enforced ignorance
of the alternatives available to them and repression of precious
First Amendment rights. In the Johnson Controls case, a
discriminatory employment policy directed against women and
masquerading as an occupational health policy threatens to set a
dangerous precedent for the elimination of women from the
industrial work force.

            The Court will no doubt address the recently passed
Americans With Disabilities Act, and the regressive sections of the
McCarran-Walter Act which exclude people from this country simply
on the basis of their political affiliations. And most
                                    841

frighteningly it will review Congress1 final deliberations on the
1990 Civil Rights Act.

         Negative decisions in these cases will have direct and dire
consequences for your constituencies, and will have a
disproportionate effect on people of color and the poor, signalling

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Since I came in late, I
will recognize Senator Kennedy.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a few
questions.

  First, I would like to ask Haywood Burns, I wonder if you are
familiar with the materials that were submitted yesterday by Mr.
Rauh, a series of articles and incidents, not only in New Hamp-
shire papers but other national newspapers, that talked about vari-
ous incidents involving racial unrest in New Hampshire.

  Mr. BURNS. Senator, I believe I am familiar with those materials,
as well as other materials that would speak to the issue of the pres-
ence of discrimination in that State.

  Senator KENNEDY. Have you formed any opinion whether you
think that those new reports are consistent with Judge Souter's
opinion that he presented to the committee that there are no racial
problems in New Hampshire?

  Mr. BURNS. Senator, as I tried to indicate in my testimony, I find
it very difficult to understand how anyone in this day and time
could make that statement with regard to any State. I am not pick-
ing on New Hampshire. I know you are not either, but after seeing
that material and understanding the extent to which there are evi-
dences all around him of racial discrimination, it is hard for me to
know how he could not be aware of them or sensitive to them.

  The Klan is marching in Portsmouth in full uniform regalia, in
Dover and Exeter, town after town in New Hampshire, this year,
not some time in the distant past. His own representative in the
State legislature has been called on the carpet for his racist re-
marks with regard to black people. The supreme court in his own
State has made rulings with respect to the rights of black workers
who were discriminated against in his State. So it is hard for me,
sir, seeing that material and looking at other material, to under-
stand how he could feel that there is no discrimination in his State.

  Time after time, the debate has gone on in the State about
Martin Luther King's birthday being a holiday, and the kind of
racist statements that have been made around that particular
debate would seem to me to be something that any person who was
sensitive, aware, intelligent, in contact, would know about and
have some reaction to.

  Senator KENNEDY. Of course, the principal locations of blacks in
New Hampshire, in Portsmouth, along the coast, that tradition ac-
tually goes back to the Revolutionary War. It is one of the oldest
communities of blacks in any part of New England. Manchester is
somewhat different, and so the significance of a Ku Klux Klan
marching in Portsmouth in a small State is not something that
people would miss for those obvious reasons. Portsmouth, to my
knowledge, has been relatively free--a number of incidents that
have been raised yesterday by Mr. Rauh--of a lot of tension, but
there is no question that it is an important tradition. Although
small in percentage numbers, there is an important tradition in
New Hampshire involving blacks more recently.

  We heard testimony earlier, again, Mr. Burns, that you were in
school with Judge Souter and that your impression of his sensitivi-
ty to the issues of the time differs from that expressed by a previ-
ous witness. Could you be any more specific?
                                               843

  Mr. BURNS. I would be glad to, Senator. As I indicated, I had no
intention of addressing this committee on that matter when I came
in this morning, but when I saw my friend here, Mr. Williams,
giving his view, I thought I owed it to the committee, since I saw
the truth through a different prism, to share my view.

  It is not to come before you and to say that the David Souter I
knew at that time was a mean-spirited person--he was not--or to
say that he was biased. I saw no indication of that. But I think that
is too low a standard when we are talking about this seat on the
Supreme Court. I think it is too low a standard when we should be
concerned with a person's views with respect to the protection of
rights.

  I was in the same house or dormitory with David Souter as a stu-
dent. I believe he was 1 year ahead of me. For 2 years we lived in
the same house; we ate in the same dining room; and he was a
person that I did know at that time. I have not continued my con-
tact with him over the years, and so I am not in a position to com-
ment on how he has changed. But the person that I knew was very
different than the one that Mr. Williams described.

  Senator KENNEDY. In what respect?
  Mr. BURNS. Although I saw no bias nor mean-spiritedness, I did
not see any particular compassion or particular concern about the
rights of the poor or people of color. This was a time in the 1960's,
Senator, when I was in college and he was in college, and the
whole country was in an uproar. Our very college and the very
house I lived in, Lowell House, was one where we had a lot of con-
cern about those issues. David Souter never did. Or at least he
never expressed it or showed it, in fairness.
  Senator KENNEDY. Were you involved in any of those meetings,
either on the issues involving civil rights or poverty issues?
  Mr. BURNS. Yes, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. AS I remember, there was a good deal of activ-
ity in most universities, and certainly Harvard is no exception.
Hardly an evening goes by when there was not some meeting, some
engagement, some discussion, some discussion group. In the earlier
exchange, I think the chairman was asking whether there had
been any activity by either attending any of these meetings that
were talking about these issues or any other rallies involved in sort
of the life of the university that was focusing attention or discus-
sion or debate on any of these questions. I think the answer was
that he might have attended, but it was more of an official func-
tion to try and ensure that order was secured.
  Mr. BURNS. Yes, I believe that Mr. Williams was testifying about
a time slightly later in time. He was testifying, I think, about a
point when they were both at Harvard Law School, and they were
in some way involved as freshmen proctors.
  Senator KENNEDY. I see.
  Mr. BURNS. The time I am testifying about is slightly before that
when Mr. Souter and I were both undergraduates. I did not see
him at any of those meetings. I did not see him involved in any of
those activities.
  Now, I hasten to say I don't make this a litmus test, but I just
think that, in fairness, if you heard one point of view, you should
hear the experience of another person who is appearing before you.
                                               844

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, you had a lot of students that came on
down to the march on Washington, Martin Luther King's great
speech in the summer of 1963,1 believe.

  Mr. BURNS. August 28, 1963.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me, if I could, turn to Ms. Ettelbrick and
Ms. Vaid, in your written opinion you focus on Judge Souter's join-
ing an opinion that prohibited homosexuals becoming foster adop-
tive parents. That opinion in itself is troubling, but I would be in-
terested in hearing what implications that opinion has in your
view for other issues involving minorities in our society. Ms. Ettel-
brick?
  Ms. ETTELBRICK. Well, I think the implications are one of--well,
let me say this, contradictory to what Judge Souter has testified to
in terms of listening to both sides and looking at the evidence and
making important constitutional decisions based on the evidence
before him. I think the opinion of the justices in the foster parent
adoption case belies that view of his. I think that if Judge Souter
was willing to totally disregard, as the majority opinion in that de-
cision indicated explicitly--they said, "We note that there are
many articles and many social studies, social science studies to the
contrary"--to the contrary meaning proving that lesbians and gay
men do not per se make bad parents. "We note that all those stud-
ies are to the contrary. However, we still think that they are bad
role models." That is essentially what this court said.
  Obviously, the court disregarded the gross majority of the evi-
dence. The dissent pointed out and reminded the court that most of
the social science data and, in fact, the lead of other States was
contrary to the court's decision; that, in fact, social science data
has pointed out that lesbian and gay parents are no better or no
worse than heterosexual parents.
  I think the implication for other minorities is that if Judge
Souter was willing to totally disregard the evidence presented to
the Court in that case, there is no indication I would have that he
wouldn't disregard contrary evidence regarding women, people of
color, the poor, other kinds of people who are usually not able to
impact in the majoritarian process.
  Ms. VAID. The only thing I would add to that is that there is an-
other implication. The refusal to recognize that gay and lesbian
prospective parents had due process was another troubling part of
that decision. Constitutional due process is a broad concept, and I
think that the law created an irrebuttable presumption, that any
prospective applicant who is gay or lesbian was unfit to parent. It
allowed the prospective application absolutely no opportunity to
present the merits of their petition, to present the merits of their
situation. There was no exception made. That, according to the dis-
senting judge and in our view, denied due process. So a broader in-
terpretation needs to be made of this decision about Judge Souter's
views on the appropriateness of due process.
  Senator KENNEDY. My time has just about expired. But if I could
ask, Mr. Ryder, in your prepared statement you comment that
Judge Souter in his testimony before the committee discussed some
questions of constitutional interpretation but not others. Do you
want to elaborate on that?
                                      845
  Mr. RYDER. Well, most specifically and the most obvious is, of
course, a number of Senators' efforts to get some response even as
to the constitutional principles underlying Roe y. Wade. That is
plainly the most obvious. The War Powers issue is the other most
notable instance. This is talking about an action 30 years ago that
is dusty history. I think that to have entered into some discussion
of the constitutional principles, the issues, is radically different
from discussing the outcome of the specific case.
  That distinction is fundamental, and as was noted even by those
favorable to Judge Souter's confirmation, if there were reasons of
propriety, if there were an interpretation of the code of judicial
conduct that would have said that one may not comment on
issues--not cases, issues--likely to come before the Supreme Court,
then I think we would all be subject to disbarment.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank
the panel.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to welcome the members of this group to the committee. I
have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simon?
  Senator SIMON. Yes, I apologize for not being here for your state-
ments. I have been involved in a meeting on the Middle East situa-
tion that Senator Biden has also been involved in.
  Let me just make a note that I think is appropriate at this occa-
sion, Mr. Chairman. Someone who ordinarily has been here who
would be testifying today, Althea Simmons, the lobbyist for the
NAACP, died the other day. Her funeral service is tomorrow. She
made a great contribution over the years to this committee for all
kinds of good causes, and I think we should note in the record that
this committee has suffered a loss, the NAACP has suffered a loss,
and the Nation has suffered a loss from the death of Althea Sim-
mons.
  Let me ask just one general question of you. I have been trying
to read your testimony here quickly. As I examine the record of
Judge Souter--the record being not simply the formal record but
also newspaper clippings and other things--I confess I had a con-
siderable amount of unease. Frankly, his testimony reveals a more
enlightened Judge Souter. The question is, I guess--and this is a
subjective thing that each of us has to consider, and I would be in-
terested in any reactions you may have--is this modification
growth or is it political adaptation before the Judiciary Committee?
Any reflections?
  Ms. VAID. My grandfather always said you are measured by your
deeds, not by your words, and I urge this committee to look at the
nearly 20 years, I think, of public service that the nominee has.
There is a record. There are opinions. The extensive schooling and
training and study that he has, indeed, by admission, put in in the
last couple of months to prepare for this forum are reflected in his
brilliant performance, but we are not here to measure a stylistic
performance, I think, as I am sure you acknowledge. We are here
to evaluate how he will handle the Constitution.
                                               846

  I hope that answers your question. I think you measure him by
his words and his deeds over time.

  Senator SIMON. Any other reflections?
  Ms. Rios. I would agree that he has to be measured by his record,
and I think it is also telling that his record is consistent up until
the time that these hearings began to take place. As we indicated
in our testimony, we believe he has gone through a confirmation
conversion.
  I also think that even in his answers throughout this hearing
and throughout the questioning, he has indicated a lack of commit-
ment to equal justice and to liberty. His refusal to answer many
questions, his speaking in very vague and ambiguous generalities
has indicated to me that he has no change of heart with regard to
his previous record of 20 years.
  Senator SIMON. I would hasten to add, while I said his testimony
showed greater enlightenment, a major exception was when he said
there was no discrimination in New Hampshire. Obviously there
are problems in every one of our 50 States, I regret to say.
  Mr. BURNS. Senator, I, too, agree that there is a great gap be-
tween the rhetoric and the record with respect to Judge Souter. I
am not in a position, of course, to say whether he had some kind of
road to Damascus conversion in the last 3 months, but I do think
that what we have to depend upon, if we are going to make a judg-
ment as somber as the one that you have to make, is what the
person has done over the last two decades. The Supreme Court of
the United States is one in which in the last 2 years the person
sitting in the seat that Judge Souter seeks to occupy was the decid-
ing vote, and more than 20 times, on issues that are fundamental
to the people of this country: civil rights, civil liberties, Federal-
State relations, and so forth. We can't afford to make a leap of
faith over that gap that I am talking about. I think we have to
read the record and go on the record.
  Ms. ETTELBRICK. Senator Simon, I think there is probably no
other panel than this one and the panel of women's groups who
testified yesterday who would love to see that conversion as being a
matter of growth. I think when I look at the record--and I have
listened to a good part of Judge Souter's testimony--I am more dis-
turbed than I was even coming into this on some level. I feel I
know less about the man than I did before.
  We all read his record. We all had a good sense where he was.
We thought long and hard about our decision to oppose this nomi-
nee. The reason that there were no groups that came out immedi-
ately opposed to Judge Souter is that all of us were looking very
closely at all facets of his record.
  I feel I know him less now, and, No. 1, I think that that question
might be best delivered to him and asked of him. In support of
that, I think that he needs to be brought back to this table and
asked some of those questions in light of some of the other views
that we have presented to this committee.
  Mr. RYDER. If I may, Supreme Court Watch's concern is princi-
pally the analysis of the record, and that is the history of the insti-
tution. On that basis, we have that broad range of concerns that we
share with you.
                                               847

  On the other hand, his words even in his testimony had excep-
tions above and beyond, and I cited the mathematical statement as
really a very, very strong statement and quite an unfortunate one.
Also, the inconsistency even within the testimony is now record,
and that as well evinces, I think, some very troubling concerns. I
share this notion that one should perhaps explore these issues yet
further. That, of course, was our stated position before the hear-
ings, that the Senate must explore this candidate extremely, ex-
tremely carefully.

  The upshot of this is really the basis of our position beforehand.
Now it is more important to get a clear view from the testimony
since the record was silent or unclear. In part, that is our concern
with the nominee after the testimony.

  Ms. Rios. I would like to add one more thing, if I might, and I
add this most respectfully to all of you. I think that if the nominee
had been questioned as rigorously and in as exacting a manner as
the panel of feminist women who were here yesterday, perhaps we
would know a little bit more about him at this point than we do.

  Senator SIMON. I thank all of you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Ryder, you testified, and your written statement is the same,
to the effect about the Colbath case, where you say that, "In State
v. Colbath, on the other hand, Judge Souter granted an accused
rapist a new trial because he considered that evidence of the vic-
tim's previous sexual conduct should have been admissible where
consent was a defense." Then you go on to say, "In what may at
best be described as insensitivity, Judge Souter suggested that a
victim might have alleged rape as a way to excuse 'her undignified
predicament.'"
  When you testify that Judge Souter suggested that the victim
might have alleged rape as a way to excuse her undignified predic-
ament, I would raise the question with you as to whether he made
that suggestion or whether he said that the evidence should have
been submitted to a jury so that they could come to a conclusion.
They are two very, very different things as to whether Judge
Souter is stereotyping or drawing any conclusions as to the alleged
victim, or whether he is saying that these are probative and rele-
vant for a jury to consider.
  In that case--and I read now from the opinion--"Before they"--
referring to the defendant charged with rape and the woman who
said that she was raped. "Before they left the trailer, the two of
them were joined unexpectedly by a young woman who lived with
the defendant, who came home at an unusual hour suspecting that
the defendant was indulging in faithless behavior. With her suspi-
cion confirmed, she became enraged, kicked the trailer door open,
and went for the complainant, whom she assaulted violently and
dragged outside by the hair."
  Then the opinion goes on further on an analysis of the factual
allegations. "The companion's furious behavior had a further bear-
ing on the case as well, for the jury could have regarded her attack
as a reason for the complainant to regret a voluntary liaison with
the defendant and as a motive for the complainant to allege rape
                                      848
as a way to explain her injuries and excuse her undignified predic-
ament.

   Now, in your testimony, you refer to "her undignified predica-
ment." But isn't the context of this case really a conclusion by the
court, a unanimous court, that the jury should have been able to
consider these facts as relevant--these allegations or this testimo-
ny as relevant testimony to decide whether there was consent or
force in the admitted sexual intercourse, as opposed to any sugges-
tion by Judge Souter as to what the woman did?

  Mr. RYDER. Senator, I believe Supreme Court Watch recognizes
the gravity of the conclusion we draw from this case. Put it its sim-
plest, he didn't have to use those words. He could have said, as you
just said and ably paraphrased, this case should be sent back, this
evidence should be discovered.

  Judge Souter has said he is open, and he has further added, in
describing his refusals to testify, that he could be wrong. We all go
wrong. I think that sensitivity, which is the word that we used, re-
quires that he be cognizant of the fact that just maybe he was
wrong, just maybe the facts were different. Just maybe. In that
event, I think it was very important to a rape victim, as she reads
this opinion at another time, that she not be characterized in that
fashion.

  It is that simple. I agree with you entirely that there was discus-
sion of whether it should be sent back, fact, et cetera. It is the
words, and the words evince a temperament that we believe raises
the gravest concerns about whether Judge Souter should be on the
Supreme Court at this crucial time for our society.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Ryder, aside from what you characterized
as inappropriate selection of words, do you agree with Judge
Souter s legal conclusion for the unanimous court that this evi-
dence should have been before the jury so that the jury could have
considered the defendant's testimony on the question as to whether
there was consent or force?

  Mr. RYDER. TO be fair, I would want to have reviewed truly the
record in that case and the briefs--I am sorry, I am certainly no
judge--to come to that conclusion, and the history above all of the
rape shield law. We believe strongly that a limitation of the rape
shield law needs to be considered with the greatest care, but I
really cannot sort of say up or down whether that decision was
rightly decided, a majority though it might have been.

  I must repeat our focus is on the fact that the record is so slim.
We must grasp at every straw just to understand one or another
way, and the language bespeaks something fearsome.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Mr. Ryder, if you find it necessary to
review the record--that is, the actual testimony--to make a deter-
mination as to whether the court was correct in saying the jury
should have considered this testimony as a jury issue on the ques-
tion of consent versus force, wouldn t it be equally necessary for
you to review the record to make a decision as to whether Judge
Souter used unnecessarily harsh language?

  Mr. RYDER. I do not believe so.
  Senator SPECTER. Why not?
  Mr. RYDER. He stated those facts which he found necessary to
support his conclusions, or he relied on those facts, let us say, in
                                      849

the opinion. Excuse me. He relied on those facts stated in the opin-
ion to use that choice of words. And I think on the face of that--
and at least then one can read the opinion within its own four cor-
ners--one has the insensitivity.

  And I must be frank. With all respect, I cannot see any circum-
stances, frankly, in which that use of language would be appropri-
ate. I realize it is a very small point. It is one of many, many,
many points in his record, hard points, which really come together
to put us in the position of the conclusion that we draw in the end.
But it is one of many, and I must say it is sadly eloquent.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I agree with you that it is only one. This
has unusual context for us to really get at hard facts on judging
Judge Souter and evaluating your conclusion of insensitivity. It is
very hard on a lot of this to sink your teeth into something really
tangible because there is so much which is unanswered and so
much is speculative and so much is a matter of personal predilec-
tion. But when you have a case like this, it gives us a unique oppor-
tunity to really see if the charge of Judge Souter's being insensitive
is accurate. Within the four corners of the opinion, you have object-
ed in your testimony to his statement or his conclusion about "her
undignified predicament," which arises from the facts within the
four corners of the opinion that the defendant's live-in companion
kicked the trailer door in, went for the complainant, assaulted her
violently, dragged her outside by the hair, and it took the interven-
tion of the defendant and a third woman to bring the melee to an
end.

  If that is not modestly described as an undignified predicament,
how would you describe that?

  Mr. RYDER. I wish I could summon some of our greatest Supreme
Court Justices on the most basic subject that I believe every
member of this committee would agree with, and that is judicial re-
straint. This is unrestrained language and he could be wrong. He
has told us that we must all be wrong. We cannot all be wrong. It
seems to me absolutely vital that one must not use--and I am
sorry, we are dealing only with three words, I suppose, or two, but
one must not use that kind of language, to my view, under any cir-
cumstance, unless he was there in the melee, then maybe, but--
and not even that, I do not think, but certainly not in a situation
where he is dealing with allegations and counter-allegations.

  Please, Senator, I feel extremely uneasy and I am certain my or-
ganization would, as well, in focusing so exclusively on two or three
words, and they have dwelt on at great length. There is more
where they came from and it was in a reading, as best we could, of
all the record available, slim it is in substance, voluminous it is,
nevertheless.

  This is not out of character. It is the most egregious or among
the most egregious, and we should not apologize for choosing that.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think it is an important point, because
it is very tangible, it is a legal opinion, there are well prescribed
limits for deciding what is relevant and what goes before a jury,
and I think I have your point, Mr. Ryder.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                                850

  I have several questions, if I may. Let me begin where Senator
Specter left off.

  I see the point that you made, Mr. Ryder, and the point that was
made yesterday by one of the witnesses relative to the language in
this case, but I, quite frankly, have always looked to your organiza-
tion, among others, when I have needed help on matters relating to
equal rights

  Mr. RYDER. I am flattered.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you know that to be true--on individual
rights and basic civil liberties, and I hope you are not leaving the
impression that there are not circumstances where conflicting
rights of an individual under the Constitution might not be put in
jeopardy, if they were not considered in tandem with the rape
shield law.
  Can you give me an example for the record, so the record is not
left that way by someone representing an organization such as
yours, can you give me an example where the conduct of a com-
plainant would be relevant, notwithstanding the existence of a
rape shield law, or is there none at all ever?
  Mr. RYDER. Well, States have seen fit to adopt their rape shield
laws and they do so variously. One of the most obvious examples,
of course, is conduct of the defendant with the accuser is most obvi-
ous of examples. Generally, the rape shield
  The CHAIRMAN. If you would be more specific.
  Mr. RYDER. Well, it is clear that rape shield goes from the first
position, which is to argue that we must counteract stereotypes by
refusing to admit irrelevant evidence, evidence going to the vic-
tim's sexual conduct totally extraneous to the case.
  We do not disagree that the rape shield laws are in one of the
toughest intersections--I think this is your point--between the vic-
tim's rights to privacy, to be shielded from unfair characterization,
to make the process for the terrifying situation of a rape victim
easier and more acceptable, to avoid being dragged over the coals
in court is the core notion of rape shield. It is a line-drawing prob-
lem, though, absolutely, and we do not support and do not deny the
defendant in such a case has a right to bring in relevant testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would you give me an example of any type of
relevant testimony.
  Mr. RYDER. That, of course, was my most specific example, the
core is those actions that are directly relevant to the defendant's
sexual conduct with the victim.
  The CHAIRMAN. Give me an example. Give me an example, not a
description, an example. What would be an example of relevant
conduct?
  Mr. RYDER. Of course, consent, that is
  Ms. VAID. A witness' statement that the woman said yes.
  Mr. RYDER. I would like to defer.
  Ms. VAID. That would be relevant.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS there any circumstances where the woman's
conduct would be relevant, without any reference by a third party
as to whether or not it was the words "consent" came out?
  Mr. RYDER. YOU have now switched to the victim's conduct.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is the issue here.
                                      851

  Mr. RYDER. Right, but the victim's conduct independent of ac-
tions with the plaintiff.

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, any conduct.
  Mr. RYDER. Any time.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am the author of a bill here that wishes to
make rape a civil rights violation, I am the coauthor of the rape
shield law, I am a strong supporter, but as someone who is also
characterized as a civil libertarian in taking positions where many
times I am only one of three, four, five, seven votes in the Senate, I
found myself in a difficult position, because there are times where
the rights of an individual defendant to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, as opposed to being presumed guilty, require there
to be evidence admissible to a jury relative to the conduct of the
complainant.
  Mr. RYDER. Plainly, the victim's consent is the central issue
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, if the
  Mr. RYDER [continuing]. And the rape shield laws often specifical-
ly state that it is only where--and this is the problem with this
case--the line is perfectly drawn, there is an allegation of consent.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Mr. RYDER. Then it becomes relevant. There is the line drawn. Is
it relevant? How relevant, and
  The CHAIRMAN. And that is a question in most cases for the jury,
is it not?
  Mr. RYDER. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, if a defendant said, "I allege that Mary X
consented and was not raped, and as evidence to prove my point
that it was consent, I want to show and introduce into evidence
that Mary Smith and I, within full view of other people, prior to
leaving to the scene of the alleged rape, were engaged in conduct
that I believe most people would read as consensual," is that a cir-
cumstance under which that is arguably admissible, whether the
conduct was--I do not want to be graphic--you know, conduct that
related to a willingness to engage in sexual intercourse, is that ad-
missible evidence?
  Mr. RYDER. If it strictly goes to consent

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Mr. RYDER [continuing]. Then plainly it is the defendant's right
to attempt to adduce evidence of consent.

  The issue in this case was much broader, and I realize that you
are not questioning that specifically

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not questioning on that case.
  Mr. RYDER [continuing]. But you have actually just reiterated the
facts.
  The CHAIRMAN. I just do not want to leave the impression here,
coming from an organization such as yours, that there are no cir-
cumstances ever where the conduct of the complainant is not rele-
vant, when the issue is consent.
  Mr. RYDER. I see the point. I missed your point at the outset.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is all.
  Mr. RYDER. Absolutely, this is the defendant's right to a fair
trial, for pity sake, and the defendant's rights to exculpate. The
problem is the intersection and our principal problem is that duly
                                               852

passed rape shield laws should only be circumscribed with the
greatest of care.

  The CHAIRMAN. AS I understand your problem
  Mr. RYDER. I am sorry, if I may, I am not strictly expert in this
situation.
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Mr. RYDER. I wanted to yield to my colleague for just an instant,
if I could, as she also wanted to address your question.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please, I welcome the
  Ms. VAID. Well, I do not know if I am walking into a lion's den
here. This has been a line of questioning for two panels, and I will
not claim to be an expert on rape shield laws. I think you had actu-
ally an expert in Ms. Holtzman and many other people, and I urge
my colleagues to
  The CHAIRMAN. Some of us think we are.
  Ms. VAID. Yes, as a former civil liberties lawyer myself, I share
your concerns about the sanctity of the process of insuring a fair
trial for everybody who is accused of a crime.
  However, I think your questions and Senator Specter's questions,
with respect, are best addressed to Judge Souter, as to what his
views of the rape shield laws were, as to why he, you know--and if
these concerns have come up as a result of our past study
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, they were.
  Ms. VAID [continuing]. Again, we urge you to redirect them to
him.
  The CHAIRMAN. We do not need to, they were and they are on
the record.
  The problem I have with the law, with Judge Souter, is not so
much the conclusion that he reached--I do not know enough, I did
not go back and read the entire transcript of the trial, to make
that judgment. I am concerned, as I thought Mr. Ryder was saying
he was concerned, and I know Ms. Holtzman was concerned, in the
use of certain adjectives connoting and giving to the alleged con-
duct a status that is one that the rape shield law is designed to
avoid.
  Mr. RYDER. Precisely.
  The CHAIRMAN. And that is the only point I want to make here. I
do not necessarily agree with my colleague from Pennsylvania. But
what happens in this discussion, my concern has been it has gotten
very blurred, and I just want to make sure that (a) you are not un-
intentionally overstating your concern, and (b) that the real prob-
lem, alleged problem, the real concern, at least the one I have, is
identified, and that is the insensitivity in the use of certain adjec-
tives to describe the condition or actions of the complainant. That
is the issue.
  I do not want to leave the impression for the public at-large lis-
tening to this that, on the issue of consent, conduct is never admis-
sible, notwithstanding a rape shield law.
  Mr. RYDER. Conduct that does go to consent, absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. And does not always go to consent. For example,
I have gotten myself in a little bit of trouble in drafting my Vio-
lence Against Women Act. I pointed out that there is no circum-
stance, no matter what, no matter how, no matter what the cir-
cumstances, no matter whether a woman is--whatever her prior
                                               853

conduct is or her present conduct is, no woman, no woman ever
gives up her right not to be raped, never.

  Ms. VAID. Right. That is exactly correct, and I am so glad you
said that, Senator, because

  The CHAIRMAN. I have been saying it and I have been criticized.
  Ms. VAID. I have been on the edge of my seat.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have even used the analogy that I have gotten
letters from constituents not liking. If I walked out of here with a
$1,000 bill in my hand and walked through one of the most eco-
nomically depressed sections of town waving it and someone
grabbed it from me, and then they were apprehended the next
block and they went to trial, they could not offer as a defense they
were tempted.
  If a woman walked out of here and walked across, from here to
the Capitol, stark naked, she is guilty of violating certain laws, but
no one, no one, no one has a right to go up and rape her, and it is
no defense to say that she was being provocative in that context.
  But what we are missing here, in my humble opinion, is that
when there is a direct nexus between the alleged conduct of the
complainant and the civil liberties and constitutional rights of the
defendant to argue that that conduct went to consent, and juries
should be able to determine whether or not it went to consent, that
is a different issue.
  And there is a third issue, and then I will drop this, but it is im-
portant, I think, we not misrepresent what is at stake here. The
third issue is, in describing the alleged conduct of a complainant,
whether or not it is admissible or inadmissible, whether or not it
goes to consent, there is the question of sensitivity and pejorative
terms that carry with them in the psyche of juries something that
goes beyond what is being alleged, and that is, it seems to me, the
central debate here, that this man, whether or not he was right on
the facts, used language to describe the alleged facts in ways that
would lead juries to suspect, to lean against, to not be sympathetic
to, to lose their impartiality in the process.
  That is the only point I want to make and I would be delighted if
I never hear about this case again in my whole life.
  Now, having said that, Mr. Burns, on a different matter, I must
tell you that there are a number of things that Judge Souter has
said that allayed some of my concerns. And ultimately, by the way,
when a man or woman is before us, I give the benefit of the doubt
to someone under oath, and that unless there is compelling evi-
dence to the contrary, to say that this is now my view, to say that
it is not their view, absent some evidence of that person not being
trustworthy in the past, is a difficult thing.
  So, there are certain things that the Judge has said that have
allayed my concerns, but one that really has stuck in my craw, and
I will just say it now, because you have raised it, and it goes to
whether or not--not whether or not he believes whether there is a
right of privacy, what his view on civil rights are, specifically,
whether or not he believes the equal protection clause should be
employed to the 14th amendment very narrowly or broadly, all
those are still questions, but this goes to a different issue, and that
is a sense that I have observed in my public and private life, as an

           39-454--91 28
                                      854
attorney, of certain people who may not have a racist bone in their
body, but have an elitist attitude about democracy.

  When he said that if there was--I am paraphrasing--no evidence
of racial discrimination in the application of a test for voting, a lit-
eracy test, that the conduct was constitutional and had been ruled
to be such, which is correct.

  But the fact that he used the term "mathematical" and the
precedent terms that he used, which came across to me as saying
the following: "You know, smart people, educated people, they are
the folks who should be able to vote, and as long as you are not
discriminating based on race, sex or religion, I worried," the impli-
cation was, it may not be a bad idea to keep dumb people from
voting," sort of this, you know, Plato's philosopher king, which I
think is anathema to what our government, our form of govern-
ment stands for.

  Now, what I would like to discuss here, because my time is up, I
would like to discuss with you very briefly, give me your views
again, since you stated them and I was not here or you did not
state them, about the extent of your concern relative to the liter-
acy test issue. Was it that it evidenced racism, or was it that it evi-
denced a sense of elitism, or was it that it was unconstitutional and
he did not know it was, or was it that it was constitutional, but,
nonetheless, he should have gone a step further? Describe it for
me, please.

  Mr. BURNS. Gladly, Senator. It is my view, as I take it is yours,
from your question, that law is not mathematics, so to say that it is
a simple matter of math really leaves out values, and it was really
a question of values that I was addressing, primarily, the idea that
some people, because they cannot read, cannot participate in the
democratic process. If that were the standard, I think many people
at the beginning of the country perhaps would not have been able
to participate in the democratic process.

  I would not even go so far as to equate people who cannot read
as being dumb.

  The CHAIRMAN. Neither would I, but that, in the elitist view,
that tends to be how it is equated, in my view. I am not sure that is
his, but that is my concern.

  Mr. BURNS. NO, what came across from the arguments made was,
in my view, a real lack of understanding and appreciation for the
democratic process and respect for the citizen, and that was the
base and the gravamen of my complaint. It was not that it was nec-
essarily a racist position

  The CHAIRMAN. All right. That is the only point I was trying to
make.

  Mr. BURNS [continuing]. But I do feel that is an undemocratic po-
sition, it is a position that reflects an insensitivity to the operation
of our democracy, and that is one of the primary concerns that I
bring to these hearings.

  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that, and then we have the same
concern, as I understand your position, the same basic concern.

  Now, let me ask--my time is way up and I will yield to the Sena-
tor from Alabama?

  Senator HEFLIN. I only have one or two questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, Senator, I did not know you came in.
                                         855

  Senator HEFLIN. In the case that was remanded, do either of you
know what was the ultimate outcome? Was there a jury trial, was
the defendant found not guilty, guilty, or was there a plea bargain?
Does anyone know what happened in this particular case after the
remand occurred?

  Mr. RYDER. I am afraid we must confess we do not, and I must
add

  Senator SPECTER. IS that the rape case?

   Mr. RYDER. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. The Colbath case.
  Senator SPECTER. The Colbath case was remanded, retried, and
there was a conviction.
  Mr. RYDER. Conviction. I think, nevertheless, sir, that that deci-
sion as to the trial of facts does not go in the slightest to the deter-
mination of the sensitivity of the words used and the views that
they bespeak, with all due respect, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, if the conviction occurred, it may indicate
that you are right.
  Mr. RYDER. Perhaps.
  Senator HEFLIN. I do not know. I do not know, one way or the
other. Those are all the questions I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator was asking me what the schedule
would be from this point on, and my intention is, again, because
Rosh Hashanah and the celebration thereof begins at sundown
today, we are going to not break for lunch. I know that the press is
delighted with that decision on my part, I can see them shaking
their heads. But if we do, we will not finish the witness list today,
and I promised the witnesses we would try to get all of them, as
they went out of their way to be here on today.
  So, I guess with that, what I should do is I should follow my own
advice and not ask any more questions, and thank the panel very
much.
  Mr. Burns, if it is not a soliloquy and it is just a brief closing
statement, we would be delighted to hear it.
  Mr. BURNS. It will be very brief, Senator. I am just not sure that
you were present when I made this remark, and I wanted to make
sure that, as the Chair, you do hear it, and that is I expressed a
concern in my presentation about the response that a number of
my colleagues in legal education have received when they request-
ed to appear before this body, and I think that they played a very
important role in the previous hearings before this committee.
  I was particularly offended at a remark that was made yesterday
about how it was that those who participated in that process had
hung Mr. Bork from a cottonwood tree. I actually do not think that
is what happened. I think what happened was as democratic proc-
ess and the majority of the people in this body voted democratically
not to confirm him.
  So, I believe that constitutional scholars and other law profes-
sors, people whom my colleagues have asked to appear before the
body, even though it will take more time, have a lot to contribute,
and I ask that it be reconsidered, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, as you well can imagine, if you are offend-
ed by the characterization of how the Bork hearings were run, you
can imagine how I feel, but I suspect that battle will continue, but
                                         856

it will not be any longer with my participation. I think the facts
speak for themselves, and so do these hearings and I

   Mr. BURNS. It was a particularly odious reference, however, I
think.

   The CHAIRMAN. Well, you think that is odious, you ought to read
several of the books and just look in the back and find the name
Biden and then go tell me whether it is not odious. We all have to
be accustomed to some odious descriptions, on occasions. It is part
of the democratic process.

  Mr. BURNS. We are proud of our participation and of the result.
  The CHAIRMAN. Not only should you be proud of it, as you will I
hope acknowledge, that the participation was in large part because
of the Chairman, and so I thank you very much and I appreciate
your taking the time to be here, I really do.
  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, we are now on our tenth panel, again a
very distinguished group of Americans, representing a wide array
of interests on the next panel, panel number 10:
  Mr. John Bellizzi, Mr. Edmund Mosca, Mr. Johnny Hughes, Bob
E. Rice, and Dewey Stokes, would you come forward and, as you
are, I am going to read your very short description of who you rep-
resent and what you will be doing.
  Mr. Bellizzi is the Executive Director of the International Nar-
cotics Enforcement Officers Association, representing 10,000 drug
enforcement officers in the United States and 50 foreign nations;
Mr. Mosca is with the International Association of Chiefs of Police,
representing more than 14,000 chief law enforcement officers in
the United States and 68 foreign countries; Johnny Hughes is the
Director of Legislative Affairs of the National Troopers Coalition,
and the coalition represents 45,000 State troopers and highway
patrol officers throughout the country, and Mr. Hughes is a 20-year
veteran with the Maryland State Police, and I am sure we passed
one another on 1-95 many times; Mr. Bob E. Rice is the president of
the National Sheriffs' Association, representing more than 35,000
sheriffs, and deputy sheriffs across the country, he is from Des
Moines, IA; and Mr. Dewey Stokes is the National President of the
Fraternal Order of Police, and the FOP is the largest law enforce-
ment group in the country, representing 216,000 police officers in
48 States, and Mr. Stokes is a police officer in Columbus, OH.

  Before you begin, gentlemen, I have two things to say: Number
one, your participation on my efforts and the President's efforts
with regard to a national drug strategy and the crime legislation
has been absolutely invaluable. Without your participation and, I
might add, active and engaging participation, I do not think we
would have made one-fifth the progress that we have made, and I
want to publicly acknowledge that.

  Second, Senator Thurmond, as you know would very much want
to be here, he is in a meeting with the majority leader, in a leader-
ship meeting, and he regrets that he will not be present, but will
review the testimony, and he extends a special welcome to all of
you, and I know you all know Senator Thurmond well and know
him personally and know that his regret at not being here is heart-
felt.
                                         857

   Gentlemen, I was going to say let us start with Bellizzi, but Bel-
lizzi is not here, and if he can do it from there, we have a little
problem. Let us start with you, Mr. Mosca, and go to Mr. Hughes--
well, he is here, I guess he figured the leadership meeting was not
as important as you all--and then go to Mr. Rice and then go to
Mr. Stokes.

  Did you want to make a statement, Senator, at this point?
  Senator THURMOND. I am just glad to have them here.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then we will begin with you, Chief.

                      STATEMENT OF EDMUND MOSCA

  Mr. MOSCA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  If I may, by way of housekeeping, on the witness list they have
me listed as Old Saybrook, MA, and the residents of my community
may be a little distressed, knowing they have been members of the
State of Connecticut since 1635, so just to correct the record, it
should be Old Saybrook, CT.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, it must have been some southerner on my
staff who did that, or westerner or midwesterner, but I apologize
for that. I did not even realize that it was listed that way.
  Mr. MOSCA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Senator Thurmond and mem-
bers of the Judiciary Committee. My name is Ed Mosca, and I am
Chief of Police in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, and Chairman of the
Legislation Committee of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police.
  On behalf of Chief Charles Gruber, of Elgin, IL, our President
and our entire membership, I thank you for affording us the oppor-
tunity to briefly add our voice to those numerous others who have
come before you in support of Judge Souter's nomination to the Su-
preme Court.
  The IACP's governing body carefully reviewed the background
and the experience of Judge Souter. We were deeply moved by the
man, highly impressed with his legal training and greatly swayed
by his record as a jurist.
  We believe him to be extremely well qualified to serve on the
highest court in the United States. Our governing body voted
unanimously to endorse his nomination.
  In determining our endorsement of judicial nominees, we rely
heavily on the input of our affiliated State associations. IACP
members from New Hampshire are highly vocal and most enthusi-
astic in their support for Judge Souter. They know him to be a
common-sense jurist, with a deep respect for the values of law and
order in our society.
                                      858

  His opinions concerning search and seizure laws, Miranda rights,
fifth amendment prohibitions against self-incrimination, speedy
trials, and due process--with which, by this point, you are probably
more familiar than I--all exhibit his intellectually rigorous yet re-
ality-based common-sense approach to the role of judging. It is this
approach that we, as law enforcement executives, find very com-
patible with our societal role as defenders and preservers of public
safety.

  When President Bush nominated Judge Souter, he described the
nominee as one who would "interpret" the law rather than "legis-
late from the bench." We believe this to be the correct approach,
and we believe that Judge Souter does, indeed, warrant this de-
scription. We find him to be a careful jurist, who takes a narrow
view of his role of judge. We think it important to respect prece-
dent, to decide cases based on facts without reaching unnecessary
issues, and without announcing rules broader than necessary to the
task at hand. Judge Souter's opinions embody these same values,
but at the same time reflect flexibility and an understanding of the
many diverse constituencies and situations that face judges in our
society.

  For these reasons, the International Association of Chiefs of
Police gives Judge Souter our unqualified endorsement and sup-
port. We urge the Members of the Senate to speedily confirm his
nomination, and we thank you again for affording us this opportu-
nity.

America's largest police departments including New York City, Los Angeles,
Toronto, Chicago, Detroit, Montreal and Houston, and head the national
police forces of Israel Denmark, the PhiUipines, Korea, and Liberia, among
others. Thousands of suburban and rural police agencies throughout the
world are also represented.

  Since 1893, the IACP has facilitated the exchange of important information
among police administrators and promoted the highest possible standards
of performance and conduct within the police profession. This work is carried
out by functionally oriented committees consisting of police practitioners
with a high degree of expertise that provide contemporary information on
trends, issues, and experiences in policing for development of cooperative
strategies, new and innovative programs, and positions for adoption through
resolution by the association.

  Throughout its existence, the IACP has been devoted to the cause of
crime prevention and the fair and impartial enforcement of laws with respect
for constitutional and fundamental human rights.

        GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BTOEN AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
MEMBERS. I AM EDMUND MOBCA. CHIEF OF POLICE IN OLD SAYBROOK,
CONNECTICUT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE LEGISLATION COMMITTEE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE (IACP). ON BEHALF OF
CHIEF CHARLES GRUBER OF ELGIN, ILLINOIS. OUR PRESIDENT, AND OUR
ENURE MEMBERSHIP, I THANK YOU FOR AFFORDING US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BRIEFLY ADD OUR VOICE TO THOSE NUMEROUS OTHERS WHO HAVE COME
BEFOREYOUIN SUPPORT OF JUDGE SOUTER'S NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME
COURT.

THE U O ^ S GOVERNING BODYOUffiFULLYREVIEWED THE BACKGROUND AND
EXPERIENCE OF JUDGE SOUTER. WE WERE DEEPLY MOVED BY THE MAN,
HIGHLY IMPRESSED WITH HI8 LEGAL TRAINING, AND GREATLY SWAYED BY
HIS RECORD AS A JURIST. WE BELIEVE HIM TO BE EXTREMELY WELL-
QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR
GOVERNING BODY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ENDORSE HIS NOMINATION.
IN DETERMINING OUR ENDORSEMENT OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES, WE RELY
HEAVILY ON THE INPUT OF OUR AFFILIATED STATE ASSOCIATIONS. IACP
MEMBERS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE HIGHLY VOCAL AND MOST
ENTHUSIASTIC IN THEIR SUPPORT FOR JUDGE SOUTER. THEY KNOW HIM TO
BE A COMMON SENSE JURIST WITH A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE VALUES OF LAW
AND ORDER IN OUR SOCIETY. HIS OPINIONS CONCERNING SEARCH AND
SEIZURE LAWS, MIRANDA RIGHTS, FIFTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITIONS AGAINST
                                  863

 SELF.INCRIMINATION, SPEEDY TRIALS, AND DUE PROCESS · WITH WHICH, BY
 THIS POINT, YOU ARE PROBABLY MORE FAMILIAR THAN I · ALL EXHIBIT HIS
 INTELLECTUALLY RIGOROUS YET REALITY BASED AND COMMON SENSE
 APPROACH TO THE ROLE OF JUDGING. IT IS THIS APPROACH THAT WE, AS
 LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES, FIND VERY COMPATIBLE WITH OUR
 SOCIETAL ROLE AS THE DEFENDERS AND PRESERVERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH NOMINATED JUDGE SOUTER, HE DESCRIBED THE
NOMINEE AS ONE WHO WOULD INTERPRET* THE LAW RATHER THAN
 "LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH.' WE BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE CORRECT
APPROACH, AND WE BEUEVE THAT JUDGE SOUTER DOES INDEED WARRANT
THIS DESCRIPTION. WE FIND HIM TO BE A CAREFUL JURIST, WHO TAKES A
NARROW VIEW OF HIS ROLE OF JUDGE. WE THINK IT IMPORTANT TO RESPECT
PRECEDENT, TO DECIDE CASES BASED ON THE FACTS WITHOUT REACHING
UNNECESSARY ISSUES, AND WITHOUT ANNOUNCING RULES BROADER THAN
NECESSARY TO THE TASK AT HAND. JUDGE SOUTER'S OPINIONS EMBODY
THESE SAME VALUES, BUT AT THE SAME TIME REFLECT FLEXIBILITY AND AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THE MANY DIVERSE CONSTITUENCY AND SITUATIONS
THAT FACE JUDGES IN OUR SOCIETY.

FOR THESE REASONS, THE IACP GIVES JUDGE SOUTER OUR UNQUALIFIED
ENDORSEMENT AND SUPPORT. WE URGE THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TO
SPEEDILY CONFIRM HIS NOMINATION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR AFFORDING
US THIS OPPORTUNITY.

  Senator THURMOND [presiding]. We are pleased to have you here,
Sheriff Rice.

                         STATEMENT OF BOB E. RICE

   Mr. RICE. Mr. Chairman, it is a distinct honor and a privilege to
come before you and the members of this committee to share with
you reasons why the National Sheriffs' Association wholeheartedly
supports the nomination of Judge David Souter for the U.S. Su-
preme Court.

  I am Bob Rice, Sheriff of Polk County, Des Moines, IA. I am a
career law enforcement professional with a background in police
and sheriffs departments dating back to 1956. For the last 14
years, I have held the office of sheriff. I have been president of the
Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association, and it is my pleas-
ure this year to serve as president of the National Sheriffs' Asso-
ciation. The National Sheriffs 'Association was established in 1940,
representing the Nation's sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, police execu-
tives, corrections personnel, and other criminal justice officials.
The National Sheriffs' Association, with its 25,000 members, repre-
sents the 3,096 sheriffs of this country. Because of my background
in law enforcement and because of the concerns of the association's
members, I am especially grateful for the chance to address you
today.

  As law enforcement battles in the drug war and struggles with a
rising tide of violent crimes nationwide, we need an anti-crime Jus-
tice with the qualifications of Judge Souter.

  We believe that Judge Souter's distinguished career as a trial
court judge and his fine background in law enforcement makes him
an excellent choice.

  Sheriff Wayne Vetter of Rockingham County, NH, has known
Judge Souter for 17 years, since Judge Souter's term as attorney
general for the State. He states that Judge Souter is very articu-
late--something we have all observed--and he cites Judge Souter's
outstanding track record, both while attorney general and when
sitting on the bench. Sheriff Vetter goes on to say, "Judge Souter
puts a great deal of effort into interpreting laws correctly. Because
of his high level of intelligence and his knowledge, he can recite
case laws from the top of his head. Judge Souter is already an asset
to law enforcement, and sitting on the Supreme, he will be even
more so."

  Sheriff Chester Jordan of Merrimack County, NH, who has
known Judge Souter for many years, states emphatically that he is
very knowledgeable, "in fact, the best just to come along in a long
time." High words of praise.

  Police Chief Thomas King of the Manchester Police Department,
who also knows Judge Souter professionally and personally, states
that, "Judge Souter brings a balanced, scholarly approach to the
bench. He is unfailingly fair and objective. The judge seems to be
totally lacking in prejudice."

  You hear these words from law enforcement executives to whom
a person of the highest caliber, an anticrime man, a judge who rec-
ognizes the tough job facing law enforcement professionals today is
critically important. Those who know him and those who read of
                                             865

his credentials are equally enthusiastic. Our Nation's sheriffs
shoulder their position of responsibility in the criminal justice
system with pride. They fully recognize and hope for the invaluable
assistance of a man of Judge Souter's acknowledged talents and
qualifications. Frankly, we need and we want a man like Judge
Souter and what he has to offer the entire criminal justice system.

  Never in our Nation's history have we needed more desperately
to add to our highest judicial body a totally fair, impartial, brilliant
new Justice. Unquestionably, now is the hour for this man. He has
our admiration and our respect. On behalf of our Nation's sheriffs
and the National Sheriffs' Association, let me urge you to proceed
with all due haste to see that Judge Souter is seated on that bench.

  Once again, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before this
distinguished panel and voice the views of the Nation's sheriffs.
Thank you very much.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.
  Captain Hughes?

                   STATEMENT OF JOHNNY L. HUGHES

  Mr. HUGHES. Good afternoon, Senator Thurmond. It is good to
see you and Duke Short here again. Good to be here again.

  One housecleaning chore, sir. Jim Doyle, who is accompanying
me as part of my testimony, he was inadvertently left off the
panel. I have him right here with me. Would it be okay to have
him come up and sit in John Bellizzi's seat?

  Senator THURMOND. OK.
  Mr. HUGHES. Fine. Thank you.
  Mr. Chairman, honorable members of this distinguished commit-
tee, I would like to thank the committee for giving me the opportu-
nity to speak on this matter of great public interest.
  The National Troopers Coalition, an organization representing
State troopers in 44 States, strongly endorses the nomination of
Judge David Souter to Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge
Souter's background as New Hampshire attorney general--that
State's chief law enforcement officer--as a trial judge, and as a
member of his State's highest court, well qualifies him to be ap-
pointed to our Nation's highest Court. The National Troopers Coa-
lition has reviewed Judge Souter's criminal law opinions and
knows him to be a tough law enforcement justice who, at the same
time, will protect the constitutional rights of the accused.

  Law enforcement officers, like the vast majority of citizens
throughout this country, are particularly interested in a nominees'
qualifications in the area of criminal law. Our organization be-
lieves that in this area, which occupies a large percentage of cases
that reach the Supreme Court, Judge Souter has demonstrated
throughout his career a clear understanding of the challenges
facing police officers in combating crime. Judge Souter has, we be-
lieve, struck the appropriate balance between protecting the rights
of society to enforce its laws on the one hand and upholding the
constitutional rights of an accused on the other. We could not sup-
port a nominee who would sacrifice either of these interests for the
sake of the other.

   More than others, police officers know of the evil and tragic side
of life: crack houses, senseless and brutal killings, the carnage
caused by the drunk driver. These deeply concern millions of
Americans and need to be dealt with effectively by our criminal
justice system. We view the nomination of Judge Souter as evi-
dence of the President's strong commitment to effective law en-
forcement.

   Far too often our legal system breaks down after an arrest is
made. Prosecutors are handcuffed by legal rulings that turn a trial
away from a search for the truth into an exercise in legal gymnas-
tics and technicalities. Miranda rulings and the exclusionary rule
may turn a criminal proceeding into a trial more of the police offi-
cer than of the defendant. Officers who act in good faith in con-
ducting a search or interrogating a suspect may find highly rele-
vant evidence inadmissible because a court, sitting with 20/20
hindsight, finds a technical violation of a legal right.
                                               870

  Throughout his judicial career, Judge Souter has applied sound
legal principles and common sense reasoning to protect the rights
of society through effective law enforcement. He has refused to
expand the Miranda doctrine beyond its present bounds and has
admitted confessions that were voluntarily given by a defendant.

  He has been supportive of drug enforcement measures by uphold-
ing the use of pen registers on the telephones of drug suspects. In
other cases, he has rejected the hypertechnical interpretation of
the scope of search warrants, and has protected the identity of con-
fidential informants from disclosure at trial where the presence of
the informant was not necessary for a fair trial.

  In the area of drunk driving enforcement, he has supported the
use of sobriety checkpoints to detect drunk drivers and has upheld
the introduction at trial of evidence of a driver's refusal to take a
breathalyzer test when arrested for drunk driving.

  We strongly endorse Judge Souter and urge an early confirma-
tion by the Senate.

  It is good to see both of you again, and at this time I would like
to introduce James J. Doyle III, who is accompanying me here
today. He is a former Maryland assistant attorney general and
former counsel to the Maryland State Police.

  Senator THURMOND. James C. Doyle, is that it?
  Mr. DOYLE. James J. Doyle.
  Senator THURMOND. James J. Doyle.

   Mr. DOYLE. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. For the record, I want to be sure we got that
down. Mr. Doyle, do you have any statement to make?

  Mr. DOYLE. Just very briefly, Senator. I certainly would join in
everything that the other members of the law enforcement commu-
nity have said here today about Judge Souter in terms of the judge
being a tough law enforcement judge. I would, though, like to add
one other thing and emphasize one other point, having read the
majority of Judge Souter's criminal law opinions.

  I think the thing that I would like to emphasize more than any-
thing else is the fact that this judge, it is obvious, enjoys the intel-
lectual challenge of the law. His opinions in the criminal law area
have been scholarly, I think, very well reasoned. I have presented
written testimony to the committee which points out a number of
opinions which I think were very well done by Judge Souter.

  So simply the point that I would like to make is not only has he
been an effective law enforcement judge in terms of supporting le-
gitimate police practices and the actions of prosecutors, but in addi-
tion the opinions that he has written in the criminal law area have
been very well researched, very scholarly, and very well reasoned,
in my opinion.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.

          Captain Hughes is a twenty three year veteran of the
 Maryland state Police. Ke is director of Legislative and
 Congressional Affairs for the National Troopers Coalition. The
 National Troopers Coalition is composed of state police and
 highway patrol agencies throughout the United States and has a
 membership of approximately 45,000 troopers.

          Mr. Chairman, Honorable members of this distinguished
 committee. I would like to thank the committee for giving me the
 opportunity to speak on this natter of great public interest.

          Tha National Troopers Coalition, an organization
 representing state Troopers in forty-four states, strongly
 endorses the nomination of Judge David Souter to Justice of the
United states Supreme Court. Judge Soutetr's background as the
New Hampshire Attorney General, that state's chief lav
enforcement officer, as a trial judge, and as a member of his
 state1! highest CQUV ^ well qualifies him to be appointed to our
nation's highest Court. The Kational Troopers Coalition has
reviewed Judge Souter'· criminal law opinions, and knows him to
be a tough law-enforcement judge who, at the same time, will
protect the constitutional rights of the accused.

         Law enforcement officers, like the va*t Majority of oltizens
throughout this country, are particularly interested in a
nominee's qualifications in the area of criminal law. Our
organisation believes that in this area, which occupies a large
percentage of cases that reach the Supreme court, Judge fouter
has demonstrated throughout his career a clear understanding of
tha challenges faoing police officer in combating crime. Judge
                                     873

 Souter has, v* believe, struck the appropriate balance between
protecting the rights of society to enforce its lava on the one
 hand, and upholding the constitutional rights of an accused on
 the other. We oould not support a nominee who would sacrifice
 either of these interests for the sake of the other.

         More than others, police officers know of the evil and
tragic side of life: crack houses, senseless and brutal
killings, the carnage caused by the drunk driver. These deeply
concern nil lions of Americans, and need to be dealt with
effectively by our criminal justice system. We view the
nomination of Judge Souter a* evidence of the President's strong
commitment to effective lav enforcement.

          Far too often our legal system breaks down after an arrest
 is made. Prosecutor* are handcuffed by lftgal rulings that turn a
trial away from a search for the truth into en exarcise in legal
gymnastic* and technicalities. Miranda rulings and th«

exclusionary rule nay turn a criainal proceeding into a trial
more of the police officer than of the defendant. Officers who
act in good faith in conducting a search or interrogating a
suspect nay find highly relevant evidence inadmissable because a
Court, sitting with 20/20 hindsight, finds · technical violation
of a legal right.

         Throughout his judicial career Judge Souter has applied
sound legal principles and common sense reasoning to protect the
rights of society through effective law-enforcement. He has
refused to expand the Miranda doctrine beyond its present bounds,
and has admitted confessions that were voluntarily given by a
defendant.

         He has been supportive of drug enforcement measures, by
upholding the use of pen registers on the telephones of drug
suspects. In other cases, he has rejected the hyperteohnical
interpretation of the scope of search warrants, and has protected
the identity of confidential informants from disclosure at trial
where the presence of the informant was not necessary for a fair
                                    874

trial.
         In the area of drunk driving enforcement, he has supported

the uec of sobriety check points to detect drunk drivers, end has
upheld the introduction at trial of evidence of a driver's
refusal to take a breathalUer teat when arrested for drunk
driving.

         H« strongly endorse Judge Souter, and urge confirmation by
the Senate.

         Mr. Doyle ia a former Maryland Assistant Attorney General
and former Counsel to the Maryland State Police.

         X would like to thank the committee for taking the time to
hear the views of the lav enforcement community on the nomination
of Judge David Souter to the United States Supreme Court.

         X share the view taken by law enforcement agencies that
Judge Souter has taken effective positions that support police
and prosecutors in their efforts to combat crime.

         Beyond that, however, it is important to emphasise the
soholarly and well reasoned approach that Judge Souter has
consistently taken in his oriminal law opinions. While a member
of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Judge Souter has authored a
number of criminal lav opinions that are impressive for their
logic and analysis, even though some of his decisions have
resulted in reversals of convictions.

         Many of Judge Souter'· opinions display these <jualities, but
only three will be briefly »entioned here. In State v.
Valenzuala. 536 A,2d 1252 (N.H. 1987), thft defendant was arrested
on numerous drug ch&rgea after the execution of a starch and
                                     875

 seizure warrant. The warrant had been based, in part, on
 information gathered t" -·ousyh the use of a pen register, a device
 which reoords outgoing telephone numbers dialed froa the
 telephone line to which it is attached. The court order
 authorising the us* of tht pen register had not been supported by
 probable) cause. Defendant argued that the uee of the device
 violated hie right against unreasonable eearch and seieure, as
 guaranteed by the New Hampshire Constitution.

          In rejecting defendant's claim and affirming his oonviction,
Judge Souter referred to an earlier supreme Court deoision, S M i h
v. Maryland, which had held that the use of a pen register
without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.

          What is impressive about Judge Souter'« opinion in this
case is that he did not simply adopt the reasoning of the U.S.
supreme Court, but performed his own analysis and followed his
own route to his own conclusion. While the U.S. Supreme Court,
in its opinion, had spent considerable time in concluding that a
defendant did not have a subjective expectation of privacy in
dialed numbers/ since he must have realised that the telephone
company in some fashion recorded those numbers, Judge Souter
thought that issue to be irrelevant. For that reason he did not
rely on the portion of the U.S. Supreme court analysis concerning
a defendant's subjective beliefs in privacy.

         The only relevant issue for Judge Souter was whether society
would recognize as objectively reasonable the privacy of dialed
numbers. Relying on a number of decisions that held that no
Fourth Amendment protection attached to information voluntarily
conveyed to third persons, Judge. Souter ooncluded that the use of
a pen register in this situation would not violate the principle
against unreasonable searches and seizures·

         In state v. KOPP«I . 499 *.2d 977 ( K . H . 1985) Judge Souter
filed a dissenting opinion concerning the operation of sobriety
check points set up to catch drunk drivers. The majority opinion
                                      876

had concluded that the procedure violated a defendant's rights
under the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions. Judge
Souter dissented.

         Judge souter believed that the intrusion faced by a motorist
during a sobriety cheek point stop was minimal, and outweighed by
scoiety's significant interest in apprehending intoxicated
drivers.

          It is significant and « favorable reflection on Judge
Souter »s analysis that in 1990 the Supreme Court of the United
States upheld the use of sobriety checkpoints in ttiohioan state
Police v. sitz, employing essentially the same reasoning as Judge
Souter.

         Finally, judge Souter's dissent in fixatev- Penney. 536 A.2d
1242 (N.H. 1987) is also an excellent example of his logical and
well reasoned analysis in original oases. Judge souter
persuasively argued that the due process clause did not require
that police inform a drunken driver of the evidentiary
consequences of refusing to submit to a blood alcohol test, where
there vas no evidence of police deception or misconduct in
failing to advise tha driver of those consequences.

         In conclusion, Judge Souter's criminal lav opinions have
consistently been soholarly and veil written. His legal
reasoning has been impressive. He has been extremely supportive
of legitimate police procedures and of society's right to
effective lav enforcement. The national Troopers Coalition urges
confirmation of Judge David Souter by the Senate.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Stokes, we will be glad to hear from
you.

                    STATEMENT OF DEWEY R. STOKES

  Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, it is, indeed, an honor and a privilege to testify before
you today on what is perhaps the most important single subject
this distinguished panel will have to consider during this session of
Congress: the nomination of Judge David H. Souter by President
Bush to the Supreme Court of the United States.

  My name is Dewey Stokes. I am the national president of the
Fraternal Order of Police, representing 216,000 police officers in
some 48 States. The FOP represents "the cop on the street"--the
police officer most likely to be the first line of defense between the
criminal element and the society at large.

  The nature and the background of those that I have been elected
to represent confers upon me a special obligation whenever I
appear before an elected representative group. And I have testified
before this committee on a variety of legislative topics. But perhaps
in appearing today to speak on the nomination of an individual to
the highest Court in this great country, my responsibility to law
enforcement everywhere has never been any greater.

   Mr. Chairman, you and your colleagues have heard a variety of
witnesses, all of them experts in one field or another. Some are
lawyers recognized for their professional achievements, and others
are scholars in constitutional law. Still others are representative of
certain organizations, like the FOP, with a legitimate interest in
the workings of the Supreme Court. But very few of the witnesses
appearing before you on this subject will feel the daily and direct
impact of the decisions of Justice Souter as will the members of my
profession. The typical law enforcement officer is charged with the
awesome responsibility of enforcing the laws of this Nation, espe-
cially as they are interpreted by our courts. Lawyers and scholars
may debate the fine points of law, but the police officers place their
lives on the line each day carrying them out and don't have the
luxury of the time to discuss or research when making those split-
second decisions.

   With my perspective viewed in such a clear context, let me for-
mally state for the record that the National Fraternal Order of
Police endorses the nomination of Judge David H. Souter to the Su-
preme Court and has so acted in a resolution passed this weekend
at our national board meeting.

   Knowing that the time of the committee is a valuable commodi-
ty, Mr. Chairman, I will not attempt to engage either you or your
colleagues in a scholarly discussion on the legal subtleties of Judge
Souter's previously authored opinions or on the arcane points of
constitutional law. I will leave that task to the lawyers and the
other professors. I will, however, try to tell you in simple terms
why the FOP believes very strongly that Judge Souter's nomina-
tion to the high Court will benefit the law enforcement community
as well as the country as a whole.

   Today, every 24 minutes, a citizen dies in a violent act. Yet a law
enforcement officer is killed every 57 hours. So I, along with the
                                      878

FOP executive committee and our general counsel, have had the
opportunity to review a number of over 200 opinions which Judge
Souter authored during his 7 years on the New Hampshire Su-
preme Court dealing with the issues important to the police com-
munity. Whether that subject at issue involved criminal procedure,
due process, Miranda warnings, search and seizure or sentencing, I
was repeatedly impressed with the striking clarity of his reasoning
and his dedication to applying a given rule of law in a common
sense manner to the case at hand. In doing so, I believe that Judge
Souter possesses a unique ability to posit a question of law in terms
of the principal purpose of a given statute versus its specific intent.
In this way, Judge Souter has demonstrated an appreciation for
the application of the black letter of the law to fact patterns and
situations faced daily by the police officers of this country in the
course of discharging their sworn duties that do not always lend
themselves to tidy, legalistic conclusions.

  The FOP is supportive of Judge Souter not just because of his
work on the bench, but also because of his impressive track record
while in the office of attorney general for the State of New Hamp-
shire. During his rise through the ranks from an assistant attorney
general in the criminal division to deputy and finally to attorney
general, Judge Souter consistently demonstrated an appreciation
for those of us serving on the front lines of the war on crime.

  Why is it that everyone is concerned about equal representation
on the Court? So, therefore, I ask you, why not a prosecutor on the
Court? Why fill the Court with defense attorneys and corporate
lawyers? We would appreciate someone on the Court who under-
stands and can feel what we in law enforcement go through on a
daily basis.

  Just as important as any other one specific opinion authored by
the nominee is, however, the suggestion of a common thread woven
throughout the fabric of Judge Souter's legal writings. I believe
that common thread or theme to be a strong devotion to the integ-
rity and independence of the judicial branch of the Government
and the vital role that it must play in our form of Government.
The very validity of our judicial branch of Government rests upon
the cornerstone of a fundamental commitment to established rules
of law completely divorced of all political or personal dynamics.
What my fellow law enforcement officers want in a judge, in any
judge, is a consistent, impartial, concise and fair adjudication of the
fact and law that helps us do our job in a professional as well as
efficient manner. In this regard, I strongly believe that there is no
question but that Judge Souter embodies these qualities.

  I cannot help but to be dismayed by certain elements, across the
ideological spectrum, at work here today who seek to elicit the
"right" or the "correct" answer from the nominee on a variety of
constitutional law subjects prior to the rendering of an endorse-
ment. The 1988 Democratic nominee for President was fond of
framing the central issue of that election as being "not of ideology,
but of competence." Leaving aside the validity of that observation
in that particular context, I wonder whether that statement might
be more topical to today's proceedings instead.
                                      879
  At our recent national board meeting, our trustees presented
that resolution in a unanimous form, and we, therefore, strongly
support and urge that you confirm Judge Souter.
  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I urge you to
move the nomination forward as rapidly as possible and for confir-
mation, not just for the protection of law enforcement but for the
benefit of all Americans.
  I thank you for the opportunity to express the views of law en-
forcement and our concerns and our position on this issue.

                 MR. CHAIRMAN, MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY, IT IS
INDEED AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY ON
WHAT IS PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT THIS
DISTINGUISHED PANEL WILL HAVE CONSIDERED DURING THIS SESSION OF
CONGRESS -- THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE DAVID H. SOUTER BY PRESIDENT
BUSH TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

                 MY NAME IS DEWEY STOKES. I AM THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT
OF THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE (FOP), THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND
REPRESENTING OVER 216,000 POLICE OFFICERS IN SOME FORTY-EIGHT
STATES. THE FOP REPRESENTS "THE COP ON THE STREET" -- THE POLICE
OFFICER MOST LIKELY TO BE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE BETWEEN THE
CRIMINAL ELEMENT AND SOCIETY AT LARGE.

                 THE NATURE AND BACKGROUND OF THOSE THAT I HAVE BEEN
ELECTED TO REPRESENT CONFERS UPON ME A SPECIAL OBLIGATION
WHENEVER I APPEAR BEFORE OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES -- AND I
HAVE TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ON A VARIETY OF LEGISLATIVE
TOPICS. BUT PERHAPS, IN APPEARING TODAY TO SPEAK ON THE
NOMINATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THIS GREAT
COUNTRY, MY RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICE EVERYWHERE HAS NEVER BEEN
GREATER.

                  MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE HEARD A
 VARIETY OF WITNESSES, ALL OF THEM EXPERTS IN ONE FIELD OR
 ANOTHER. SOME ARE LAWYERS RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL
 ACHIEVEMENTS AND OTHERS ARE SCHOLARS IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
 STILL OTHERS ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS, LIKE
 THE FOP, WITH A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN THE WORKINGS OF THE
 SUPREME COURT. BUT VERY FEW OF THE WITNESSES APPEARING BEFORE
 YOU ON THIS SUBJECT WILL FEEL THE DAILY AND DIRECT IMPACT OF THE
 DECISIONS OF A JUSTICE SOUTER AS WILL THE MEMBERS OF MY
 ORGANIZATION, THE TYPICAL POLICE OFFICER CHARGED WITH THE AWESOME
                                      882

RESPONSIBILITY OF ENFORCING THE LAWS OF THIS NATION -- ESPECIALLY
AS INTERPRETED BY OUR COURTS. LAWYERS AND SCHOLARS MAY DEBATE
THE FINE POINTS OF THE LAW, MR. CHAIRMAN, BUT POLICE OFFICERS
PLACE THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EACH DAY CARRYING THEM OUT.

                 WITH MY PERSPECTIVE VIEWED IN SUCH A CLEAR CONTEXT, LET
ME FORMALLY STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE NATIONAL FRATERNAL
ORDER OF POLICE IS PROUD TO ENDORSE THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE DAVID
H. SOUTER FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

                 KNOWING THAT THE TIME OF THE COMMITTEE IS A VALUABLE
COMMODITY, MR. CHAIRMAN, I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE EITHER YOU
OR YOUR COLLEAGUES IN A SCHOLARLY DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL
SUBTLETIES OF JUDGE SOUTER'S PREVIOUSLY AUTHORED OPINIONS OR ON
ARCANE POINTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW -- I WILL LEAVE THAT TASK TO
THE LAWYERS AND THE LAW PROFESSORS. I WILL, HOWEVER, TRY TO TELL
YOU IN SIMPLE TERMS WHY THE FOP BELIEVES VERY STRONGLY THAT JUDGE
SOUTER'S NOMINATION TO THE HIGH COURT WOULD BENEFIT THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE.

                  I, ALONG WITH THE FOP'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND OUR
GENERAL COUNSEL, HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW A NUMBER OF
THE OVER TWO-HUNDRED OPINIONS WHICH JUDGE SOUTER AUTHORED DURING
HIS SEVEN YEARS ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPREME COURT DEALING WITH
ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE POLICE COMMUNITY. WHETHER THE SUBJECT AT
ISSUE INVOLVED CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND DUE PROCESS, "MIRANDA"
WARNINGS, SEARCH AND SEIZURE OR SENTENCING, I WAS REPEATEDLY
IMPRESSED WITH THE STRIKING CLARITY OF HIS REASONING AND HIS
DEDICATION TO APPLYING A GIVEN RULE OF LAW IN A COMMON SENSE
MANNER TO THE CASE AT HAND. IN DOING SO, I BELIEVE THAT JUDGE
SOUTER POSSESSES THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO POSIT A QUESTION OF LAW IN
TERMS OF THE PRINCIPLE PURPOSE OF A GIVEN STATUTE VERSUS IT'S
SPECIFIC INTENT. IN THIS WAY, JUDGE SOUTER HAS DEMONSTRATED AN
APPRECIATION FOR THE APPLICATION OF BLACK LETTER LAW TO FACT
                                      883

PATTERNS AND SITUATIONS FACED DAILY BY POLICE IN THE COURSE OF
DISCHARGING THEIR SWORN DUTIES THAT DO NOT ALWAYS LEND THEMSELVES
TO TIDY, LEGALISTIC CONCLUSIONS.

                 THE FOP IS SUPPORTIVE OF JUDGE SOUTER NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF HIS WORK ON THE BENCH, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS IMPRESSIVE
TRACK RECORD WHILE IN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE
STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. DURING HIS RISE THROUGH THE RANKS FROM
AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE CRIMINAL DIVISION TO DEPUTY
AND FINALLY TO ATTORNEY GENERAL, JUDGE SOUTER CONSISTENTLY
DEMONSTRATED AN APPRECIATION FOR THOSE OF US SERVING ON THE FRONT
LINES OF THE WAR ON CRIME.

                 JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ANY ONE SPECIFIC OPINION AUTHORED
BY THE NOMINEE IS, HOWEVER, THE SUGGESTION OF A COMMON THREAD
WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE FABRIC OF JUDGE SOUTER'S LEGAL WRITINGS. I
BELIEVE THAT COMMON THREAD OR THEME TO BE A STRONG DEVOTION TO
THE INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT AND THE VITAL ROLE THAT IT MUST PLAY IN OUR FORM OF
GOVERNMENT. THE VERY VALIDITY OF OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT RESTS UPON THE CORNERSTONE OF A FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT
TO ESTABLISHED RULES OF LAW COMPLETELY DIVORCED OF ALL POLITICAL
OR PERSONAL DYNAMICS. WHAT MY FELLOW POLICE OFFICERS WANT IN A
JUDGE -- ANY JUDGE -- IS A CONSISTENT, IMPARTIAL, CONCISE AND
FAIR ADJUDICATION OF FACT AND LAW THAT HELPS US DO OUR JOB IN A
PROFESSIONAL AS WELL AS EFFICIENT MANNER. IN THIS REGARD, I
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT JUDGE SOUTER
EMBODIES THOSE QUALITIES.

                 I CANNOT HELP BUT TO BE DISMAYED BY CERTAIN ELEMENTS,
ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, AT WORK HERE TODAY WHO SEEK TO
ELICIT THE "RIGHT" OR "CORRECT" ANSWERS FROM THE NOMINEE ON A
VARIETY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SUBJECTS PRIOR TO THE RENDERING OF
AN ENDORSEMENT. THE 1988 DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT WAS
                                     884

FOND OF FRAMING THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THAT ELECTION AS BEING "NOT
OF IDEOLOGY, BUT OF COMPETENCE." LEAVING ASIDE THE VALIDITY OF
THAT OBSERVATION IN THAT PARTICULAR CONTEXT, I WONDER WHETHER
THAT STATEMENT MIGHT BE MORE TOPICAL TO TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS
INSTEAD.

                 MR. CHAIRMAN, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I URGE YOU TO
VOTE FOR JUDGE SOUTER AND TO MOVE HIS NOMINATION TO THE U.S.
SUPREME COURT FORWARD IN AN EXPEDITIOUS FASHION.

                 I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I WOULD
BE PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.
                                     885
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama--I beg your pardon. I
am really sorry. How I could have made that mistake is beyond
me.
  The Senator from South Carolina. I was distracting myself by
asking the staff a question, and I hope you will forgive me, Sena-
tor. That is a big mistake to make with this gentleman.
  Senator THURMOND. Oh, not at all. We all make mistakes. It is a
minor thing. Forget it.
  Mr. Chairman, I have another meeting I have got to go to. I went
to this meeting for a while, but I came back especially to hear this
particular group. There is no group in this country I have greater
respect for than the law enforcement officers. Just as our soldiers
protect us against external enemies, the law enforcement officers
protect us from internal enemies. That is the criminal. I commend
you for your great work. I congratulate you for taking time to come
here today and testify.
  Now, I am just going to ask you one question. Is it your opinion
that Judge Souter has the integrity, the professional competency,
the judicial temperament, the courage, the compassion, the under-
standing of the majesty of our system of Government, and the fair-
ness to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States? We
will start right on in, Mr. Doyle.
  Mr. DOYLE. Yes, Senator. Having read Judge Souter's opinions, I
think there is no question that he is so qualified to be Associate
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Senator THURMOND. Chief Mosca?
  Mr. MOSCA. Yes, Senator. I have spoken to a number of my col-
leagues, particularly from New Hampshire, and they would cer-
tainly embody those qualities that you describe.
  Senator THURMOND. I am not too sure that our positions have
been entered on the record. Mr. Doyle represents the International
Narcotics Enforcement Officers Association.
  Mr. DOYLE. NO, Senator. I am representing the National Troopers
Coalition. I am an attorney.
  Senator THURMOND. Oh, you are with Captain Hughes.
  Mr. DOYLE. Yes, Senator. That is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. I see. And Chief Mosca is with the Interna-
tional Association of Chiefs of Police.
  Mr. MOSCA. Yes, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. And, Sheriff Rice, what is your answer to
that question?
  Mr. RICE. Yes, sir, very much so.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU represent the National Sheriffs' Asso-
ciation.

   Mr. RICE. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Captain Hughes represents the National
Troopers Coalition. And what is your answer, Captain Hughes, to
that question?

  Mr. HUGHES. Yes, sir, without a doubt.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Stokes is the national president of the
Fraternal Order of Police. What is your answer to that question?
  Mr. STOKES. Sir, we have looked at all of his opinions, and we be-
lieve that based on the written opinion and some of the remarks
that he has made in those written opinions, he will provide this

      39-454-91 29
                                          886

country with the type of leadership that law enforcement would
desire on the Supreme Court. So my answer is emphatically yes.

   Senator THURMOND. Again, I want to thank all of you for coming
here and testifying. I appreciate your doing so. I am in accord with
the statements you made.

   I am going to have to leave now to go to another hearing. I just
want to say to the chairman before I go that my position on this
nomination is just the same as these able and distinguished law en-
forcement officers have given here today. I think that Judge Souter
does possess the integrity, the professional competency, the judicial
temperament, the courage, the compassion, the understanding of
the majesty of our system of Government, and the fairness and the
dedication to make an excellent Supreme Court Justice of the
United States.

   Mr. Chairman, before I leave, I want to take this opportunity
again to express to you my appreciation for the fairness with which
you have conducted this investigation, the courtesies you have ex-
tended to everyone, especially to the ranking member, and we ap-
preciate all that you have done in connection with this investiga-
tion.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. It is always--
and I mean this literally--always a pleasure to work with you. You
are always fair as well.

  The Senator from Illinois. I got it right this time.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have no questions. I simply want to thank all of you for your
testimony, and also to note with pleasure that the police organiza-
tions have become more active on Capitol Hill in speaking up. I
don't think there is any question that your speaking up played a
decisive role in the passage of the DeConcini amendment, for exam-
ple. If one of these days we pass a waiting period for handguns so
that we don't have police officers killed once every 57 hours, I don't
think there is any question that the police officers of this Nation
are going to be playing the critical role. I think your influence on
Capitol Hill has been a good one, and I simply want to take this
opportunity to commend all of you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. STOKES. Thank you, Senator, and I hope that the people who
view these hearings will contact their Congressmen, their Repre-
sentatives, and get our crime bill moving over on the House side,
as effectively as you did in the Senate.
  Senator SIMON. That is why you are a pretty good lobbyist,
Dewey Stokes. You get those licks in wherever you can.
  Mr. STOKES. Absolutely.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Spec-
ter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I join in thanking you men for appearing here today and for all
of your hard work and effective service. There are a lot of things
we could talk about on Miranda and retroactivity and many, many
issues, but the hour is growing very late. As the chairman has al-
ready said, we are anxious to conclude. But I think your testimony
is very helpful, and I join in thanking you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, I have a couple questions, if I may.
                                      887

  We always are, when we look at judicial nominees--and, quite
frankly, nominees in the Foreign Service and other committees I
sit on, whomever is nominated for a position in the judicial branch
or the administration--we always are focusing on their judicial
temperament, how they treat people in the system with whom they
have to deal. And when it comes to judicial nominees who are pros-
ecutors, in my view we do not put enough focus on how they treat
the people with whom they have to interact the most; that is,
police officers.

  I will not name names, but I know several of you very well, and I
know if I asked you to name off the top of your head five or six
prosecutors you have dealt with who you thought did not treat you
with respect, you could do it in about one-tenth of a second. Am I
wrong? I am not going to ask for names, but I suspect you could. I
won't even ask you that, but I would be willing to bet you lunch
anywhere that you could.

  And so we have had a good deal of testimony about the degree to
which Judge Souter has been sensitive in dealing with the people
in his office and how he has treated litigants before him, and I
want to ask you this. There was some reference by Chief Mosca to
this effect, but I would like you to elaborate on it, if you can. Did
you inquire of your colleagues in New Hampshire as to how Judge
Souter treated your colleagues, local police officers, State police of-
ficers, with whom he had to deal as a prosecutor in New Hamp-
shire. And if so, what response did you get?

  Mr. MOSCA. If I may, Senator, I did speak with chiefs from New
Hampshire, particularly Chief Walcek from Concord, and Chief
Reynolds, our immediate past president, from Dover, New Hamp-
shire. Both of them were highly motivated in making sure that
Justice Souter was named, and they said his reputation across the
board with law enforcement was absolutely great.

  One of the things that seemed to come forward, aside from his
thoroughness and thoughtfulness, was the fact that they always
used the word that he had common sense. And if I can relate to
you, that means an awful lot to those of us that are on the street,
on the front lines. We really look to common sense. In all of my
inquiries, common sense was always a part of the description of
Judge Souter.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am looking for something a little bit different;
that is, to me, it makes a difference whether or not a prosecutor--
if I can be illustrative--is the kind of man or woman who gets you
in on your day off to testify in a case but fails to have the courtesy
to tell you that the case has been pled, fails to have the courtesy to
tell you that they are not going to trial that day. We all know pros-
ecutors like that.

  I can think of as many prosecutors who are disliked by police of-
ficers as I can public defenders who are disliked by police officers
because they are not treated well. That is what I mean by being
treated well, consideration being shown for the difficulty of your
job. Most Americans don't know that you make an arrest, you may
very well find on your day off you are sitting in the attorney gener-
al's office for 7 hours waiting for a prosecutor to decide whether or
not they are going to go or not go, call you as a witness, not call
                                                888

you as a witness. And those things are matters of extreme discour-
tesy, as well as courtesy extended.

  Is there any input on how he treated not the law, not the cases,
but the individual officers?

  Mr. MOSCA. Nothing negative was volunteered at all.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not suggesting there
  Mr. MOSCA. YOU can bring up certain prosecutors' names in
police circles, and you know the responses that that will elicit.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know in Delaware.
  Mr. MOSCA. But that did not happen in this case at all.
  Mr. STOKES. Senator?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, Dewey.
  Mr. STOKES. We were recently in New Hampshire doing some re-
cruitment, and we asked
  The CHAIRMAN. Taking them out of New Hampshire to Chicago?
  Mr. STOKES. We got 276 of the troopers to affiliate with us. We
have had an opportunity to talk to some of the officers up there
about some of their problems. Not specifically did we get into
Judge Souter, but overall we did not find anyone up there that
came out from the law enforcement ranks that said anything nega-
tive about Judge Souter or the way he treated them.
  The only thing I can say is sometimes when prosecutors or attor-
neys general get into these situations, because of previous court
rulings, they must bring you in to testify and give the defendant
the last second to make his or her decision, so, consequently, to
safeguard the rights of the citizenry, it is necessary to pull the
police officer in on his or her day off to be there.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know that. All I am saying is that it is one
thing to pull you in on your day off and while you are sitting there,
offer you a cup of coffee, and when you do not go to trial, say, gee,
I am sorry you had to sit here all day, and it is another thing to
not talk to you. That is what I mean by respect.
  Mr. STOKES. Well, we have not heard that complaint from any of
the officers that we had the occasion to speak with.
  The CHAIRMAN. Nor have I. I think people should know in the
record, that as we are worried about how criminal defendants are
treated, as we are worried about how plaintiffs are treated in civil
cases by the judge sitting on the bench, as we are worried about
how deputy attorneys general are treated by the attorney general
and when they work with them, one of the things that is always
left out of the equation, that always surprises me, is one of the
places where they deal the most with, the people that they deal the
most, and sometimes you are treated like you are an appendage
and is just there, even though you are central to the case and you
made the case, and other times you are treated with great respect.
  That is all I am suggesting and I heard nothing to the contrary,
but I just wanted to get it on the record, because it is a question
that I ask, because I think it is important.
  Mr. RICE. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Mr. RICE. About the same that came out of the group so far, we
did talk to a couple of sheriffs and the chiefs of police, as I men-
tioned in my testimony, and I assure you that the things that you
are asking, if they would have happened to either one of these
                                      889
sheriffs of these chiefs, that would have been at the top of the list
when we asked the questions.

  The CHAIRMAN. I agree with you, that is why I asked the ques-
tion.

  Now, fellows, one last question. You have praised the decisions
that the Judge has rendered, as evidencing a thread of common
sense and a concern for the victim, as well as the defendant, with-
out violating any of the defendant's constitutional rights.

  Now, I am going to ask you a question that you may not like me
to ask you, but when pushed during the hearing, Judge Souter
pushed on Miranda and Miranda warnings, was asked about (a)
how he felt at the time, and (b) how he felt now about Miranda
warnings. And to paraphrase his statement, he gave the rationale
for Miranda warnings and basically that he thought they worked
fine and that they were a good thing.

  Now, I will let the record stand and be corrected, if I am wrong,
if anyone would like to suggest otherwise, but I think--let me be
more precise, I have the record here, to be more precise, my staff
has the record here.

  I am quoting, "People of good will could disagree about that, but
the fact is that the time the Miranda decision came down, it cre-
ated a lot of problems for a lot of people who did not know how to
respond to it." These problems are over and done with today. I
think that most law enforcement officers can respond to it, and
anyone who wants to attack Miranda today has got, I think, the
same kind of pragmatic burden which those who had argued for
Miranda in the first place.

  At any rate, do you have any problem with his view on the Mi-
randa warnings?

  Mr. RICE. None whatsoever.
  Mr. STOKES. Senator, I think that the two important cases that
we reviewed--and there were several dealing with Miranda--was
the Lewis case and the Jones case, out of New Hampshire, and I
think that it is important to reflect that police officers since 1966,
when the Arizona Miranda case came out in 1966, that those offi-
cers since 1966, in the past 24 years, is again alluding to--and I
cannot speak for Judge Souter and what was in his mind, but at
the time he was alluding to, more than likely, that the educational
process and the professionalism of law enforcement has drastically
increased in the last 24 years, and hopefully will continue on that
pattern.
  I believe what he was alluding to at that point is that the law
enforcement officers in the last 24 years have adapted to the Mi-
randa warning as just a protection of the individual or the accused,
if you will, of their constitutional rights. So, I think we have ad-
justed to that in our training and our philosophy, so I would be-
lieve that, reading his decisions as they reflect--and I cite those
two cases, the Jones and Lewis case--I believe that is probably
what he was alluding to.
  The CHAIRMAN. I do not disagree with that. I think it was. I just
want it on the record that the fact that he believes that Miranda
makes sense now is not inconsistent with what I know from what
you have all told me personally before, that there is not a hue and
cry out there by police officers to overrule Miranda and the fact
                                         890

that he thinks it is a solid decision now is not something that gives
you reason for difficulty.

   Mr. DOYLE. NO, and if I could add one thing: Judge Souter has
had the opportunity to pass on many types of Miranda cases on the
New Hampshire Supreme Court and he has shown no inclination
to overrule the doctrine. At the same time, I think it is fair to say
he has shown no inclination to extend it beyond its present bounds.
So, I think, speaking for law enforcement, we all feel comfortable
with the position that he has taken on Miranda.

  Mr. STOKES. I think in the Jones cases, where he had the oppor-
tunity or was seeking to expand it, and Judge Souter felt that it
went to that point, as was approved by the courts.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Humphrey.
  Senator HUMPHREY. NO questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, as always, your testimony is helpful
and I think it is always important for the public to be enlightened
about how enlightened you guys are, and the women that you rep-
resent, as well, and I thank you for being here and thank you for
your help.
  As you said, Dewey, I am going to be needing to talk with you on
a completely different talk very soon when these hearings are over,
because I would like to revive my crime bill that you worked so
hard to help get passed here, and that is another question.
  Thanks for being here. I know that some of you stayed very late
last night. I apologize for not being able to get you on late last
night, but I suspect you would have not gotten on until midnight,
had we kept going, so I want to thank you all very much.
  Mr. STOKES. Thank you.
  Mr. MOSCA. Thank you, Senator.
  Mr. RICE. Thank you.
  Mr. HUGHES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, our final witness is very well read and very
well known and very persuasive, the Chairman of The Conserva-
tive Caucus, Inc., Mr. Howard Phillips.
  Is Mr. Phillips here? Thank you for being here. As I know you
know, it was not intentional to have you last. We tried very hard
to see what best panel would you fit in with, and it was your choice
to be in this circumstance. I respect that and I think it makes
sense. I hope you understand that we just did not decide to make
you last.

        STATEMENT OF HOWARD PHILLIPS, CHAIRMAN, THE
                        CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS, INC.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and I recog-
nize that the perspective which I am bringing to this nomination
is, from my standpoint, unfortunately unique. I know that every-
one is anxious to move on and

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, we have time.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. GO right ahead. We are here to listen.
                                      891
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chairman, my name is Howard Phillips and I
am Chairman of The Conservative Caucus, a nonprofit, public-
policy advocacy organization based in Vienna, VA.
  The Declaration of Independence asserted that "we are endowed
by our creator with certain inalienable rights, and that, among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The declara-
tion rested on the assumption that there exists "the laws of nature
and of nature's God."
  Our law system is necessarily rooted in and legitimated by that
fundamental recognition of higher authority.
  In considering David Souter's suitability to cast what, in many
cases, will be the deciding opinion on the Supreme Court of the
United States, it is necessary to go beyond Mr. Souter's intellectual
capacity and his stated opinions, and to assess his character and
moral courage in their relationship to the responsibilities of a Su-
preme Court Justice.
  One moment of truth for Mr. Souter came in February 1973,
when, as a member of the board of trustees of Concord Hospital, he
participated in a unanimous decision that abortions be performed
at that hospital.
  Advocacy of, or even acquiescence in, such a decision is morally
distinguishable from the judicial conclusion, profoundly incorrect,
in my view, that women have a constitutional right to destroy their
unborn children.
  It is also distinguishable from and far more troubling than the
political argument by politicians who maintain that they are "per-
sonally opposed" to abortion, even as they advocate its decriminal-
ization.
  It is one thing to intellectually rationalize the case for permit-
ting legal abortions, while still opposing the exercise of such legal
authority; it is quite another--something far more invidious, mor-
ally--to actually join in a real world decision to cause abortions to
be performed, routinely, at a particular hospital.
  Those abortions whose performance was authorized by David
Souter were not mandated by law or court opinion. In fact, laws
have remained to this day on the books in New Hampshire which
provide criminal penalties for any "attempt to procure miscar-
riage" or "intent to destroy quick child." Indeed, section 585:14 of
the New Hampshire Criminal Code establishes the charge of
second degree murder for the death of a pregnant woman in conse-
quence of an attempted abortion, nor were those abortions which
Mr. Souter authorized performed merely to save the life of the
mother, nor were they limited to cases of rape or incest.
  If the unborn child is human, and if innocent human life is to be
defended and safeguarded, why did Mr. Souter acquiesce in those
abortions? Why did he not speak out against them? Why did he,
through 12 years on the Concord Hospital board, in a position of
responsibility, help cause those abortions to be performed, and
invest his personal reputation in clearly implied approval of those
abortions?
  The overreaching moral issue in the political life of the United
States in the last third of the 20th Century is, in my opinion, the
question of abortion. Is the unborn child a human person, entitled
                                      892

to the protections pledged to each of us by the Founders of our
Nation?

  The issue is much more than one of legal or judicial philosophy.
There are men and women in the legal profession, in elected office,
and on the bench who acknowledge abortion to be morally repug-
nant, but who assert that, in present circumstances, it cannot be
constitutionally prohibited.

  Whatever Mr. Souter's legal and judicial philosophy may be--
and, on the record, it seems to be one which rejects the higher law
theories implicit in the Declaration of Independence--it is a chill-
ing fact which the Senate must consider that Judge Souter has per-
sonally participated in decisions resulting in the performance of
abortions, where such abortions were in no way mandated or re-
quired by law or court decision.

  By his own account, Mr. Souter served as a member of the board
of trustees for the Concord Hospital from 1971 until 1985. Follow-
ing service as board secretary, he was president of the board from
1978 to 1984.

  In 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court's January 22 Roe v.
Wade decision, the Concord Hospital trustees voted to initiate a
policy of performing abortions at Concord Hospital.

  Similarly, Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital, which is associated
with the Dartmouth Medical School, of which Judge Souter has
been an overseer, has performed abortions up to the end of the
second trimester.

  During the period of Mr. Souter's tenure as a decision-maker of
these two institutions, many hundreds of abortions were performed
under his authority, with no indication that he ever objected to or
protested the performance of these abortions. Even though the Roe
v. Wade decision did, in fact, authorize abortions through the ninth
month of pregnancy, nothing in the Supreme Court's decision re-
quired or obliged any hospital to conduct abortions, whether in the
ninth month, the sixth month, or even in the first month of preg-
nancy.

  If Judge Souter is confirmed as a Justice of the Supreme Court,
he will, in all likelihood, be given the opportunity to address not
only the issue of Roe v. Wade, but broader issues involving the
sanctity of innocent human life.

  Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the 1986 Thornburgh case,
"There is a fundamental and well-recognized difference between a
fetus and a human being. Indeed, if there is not such a difference,
the permissibility of terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely
be left to the will of the State legislatures."

  Justice Stevens was wrong in a very deadly way. If an unborn
child is not human, I would ask Justice Stevens, what is he, what
is she. But at least Mr. Stevens was logical in defending his sup-
port for the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade.

  In the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court indicated that if
the unborn child is a person, the State could not allow abortion,
even to save the life of the mother. In fact, in the majority opinion
deciding Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court said that, "If the person-
hood of the unborn child is established, the pro-abortion case col-
lapses, for the fetus' right to life is then guaranteed specifically by
the Fourteenth Amendment."
                                         893

  As Notre Dame law professor Charles Rice has pointed out, "This
is so, because the common law does not permit a person to kill an
innocent non-aggressor, even to save his own life."

  Does David Souter believe that the unborn child--the fetus in
the mother's womb--is a human person, deserving of all the protec-
tions which are guaranteed to human beings after the moment of
birth?

  Seemingly, Mr. Souter's answer is an unequivocal "no." By
agreeing that abortions be performed at institutions under his au-
thority, Mr. Souter established clearly that he did not recognize the
personhood of the unborn child, for surely, if he did acknowledge
the unborn child to be a human person, Mr. Souter would not have
agreed to authorize the extinguishment of so many precious lives
at medical facilities, for which he bore responsibility.

  One must conclude that either Mr. Souter accepts the view that
the life of the unborn child is of less value than the convenience
and profit of those who collaborate in the killing of that child, or
that, despite his recognition of the fact that each unborn child is
human, a handiwork of God's creation, he lacked the moral cour-
age or discernment to help prevent the destruction of so many in-
nocent human lives, when he had the authority, indeed the respon-
sibility, to do so.

  Either way, in such circumstances, unless there are mitigating
factors or extenuating considerations which have not yet been
brought to public attention, it is difficult to regard Mr. Souter as
one suitable for participation in judicial decisions at the highest
level of our Nation.

  If, during his years of responsibility at Concord Hospital and
Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital, Mr. Souter believed each fetus to
be a human person, and failed to act against the performance of
abortion, he was morally delinquent.

  If, on the other hand, he justified himself by denying the human
qualities of the unborn child, then he placed himself in the ambit
of those who have argued against the very philosophy which his
sponsor, President George Bush, purported to embrace during his
1988 Presidential campaign.

  On the basis of the information now available, Mr. Souter, in my
opinion, should not be confirmed.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, sir. Let me ask you a
couple of questions, before I yield to my colleagues from Pennsylva-
nia and New Hampshire.

  In his testimony, Judge Souter defended his vote to allow abor-
tions to be performed at Concord Hospital, by saying, among other
things, that he was acting as a trustee of the hospital. He said that
it would not be proper--and I am not quoting, I am paraphrasing--
he said that it would not be proper to allow his personal views
about abortion to determine how he performed the office of trustee,
any more than it would be proper to allow his personal views about
moral issues to affect how he did his job as a judge.

  Obviously, you are not persuaded by that explanation. Can you
tell me why you believe that explanation is flawed? I assume you
are persuaded by that explanation?

  Mr. PHILLIPS. NO, sir. As a matter of fact, I regard that explana-
tion as profoundly damning of Judge Souter's case, because, in
                                      894

effect, what Judge Souter is saying, that because something is
legal, it should, therefore, be permitted, that because abortion, in
the view of those who accept Roe v. Wade as the law of the land, is
appropriate, that, therefore, Concord Hospital should perform it.

   In fact, there is no legal requirement and there was no legal re-
quirement at that time that Concord Hospital should perform abor-
tions. In fact, I am advised that there was a case in 1977, Plelker v.
Doe, which affirmed this and which said that, even more so, private
hospitals are under no obligation, and never have been, to perform
abortions.

  I would also point out that, while Roe v. Wade was permissive
about the kinds of abortions which could be performed, that in no
way did it require private or public hospitals to perform conven-
ience abortions.

  Judge Souter, prior to being a judge, in his role as a trustee at
Concord Hospital, did not limit abortions to rape or incest or the
life of the mother. There were many hundreds of convenience abor-
tions performed at Concord Hospital, and for Judge Souter at that
point, as an adult, to have permitted that to go forward, indeed, to
have concurred in that decision and, apparently, to have advocated
that decision, can only lead me to conclude that he does not regard
the unborn child as a human being, because as I indicated in my
testimony, if he regarded the child as human, he could not, in con-
science, have authorized those convenience abortions.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO, you have reached two conclusions, that this
is not merely a case of non-feasance, it is a case of Judge Souter
being pro-abortion?

  Mr. PHILLIPS. It is clear that Judge Souter, having been given the
opportunity to vote on the question of abortion, voted for abortion
at Concord Hospital, and that as a trustee of Dartmouth Hospital,
he oversaw a situation where abortions were performed, reportedly
until the end of the second trimester, and that there were numer-
ous abortions performed that were not performed for the sake of
protecting the life of the mother or dealing with rape or incest.

  Let me say that I would oppose such abortions, as well, but even
if you take the George Bush position, he went well beyond that.
One can only conclude that, as a Justice of the Supreme Court,
there is no possibility, unless he has a change of heart, that he
would accept the concept of the personhood of the unborn child and
that, beyond that, because he rejected the concept of the person as
a human being, his decisions about when and whether abortions
might be performed would be based on entirely pragmatic consider-
ations.

  The CHAIRMAN. I cannot resist asking you this next question.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Please.
  The CHAIRMAN. I hope this will not ruin your reputation. I read
what you write, I think almost all of what you write. You men-
tioned President Bush. Do you think President Bush is committed
to a position of overruling Roe v. Wade?
  Mr. PHILLIPS. YOU know, President Bush once said that he was a
conservative, but he wasn't a nut about it, and I think that is a fair
way of describing his view on abortion, that he is against abortion,
but he is not a nut about it.
                                      895
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. I accept that answer. I admit, it is beyond
the scope of this hearing, other than tangentially.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. But it seems to me that the President did have a
greater duty of care than that which he exercised in the selection
of Judge Souter, given the kinds of commitments which he made
during the 1988 presidential campaign and given the kinds of com-
mitments that were in the Republican Platform.
  Let me say also, responding to your question, that while Justice
O'Connor--and this has been pointed out by other witnesses--
while Justice O'Connor was careful not to preview her vote on Roe
v. Wade, when she was up for confirmation, she made it quite clear
that she found abortion to be morally repugnant.
  I found it rather chilling that Judge Souter was not even willing
to say that. I know there are many liberal democratic United
States Senators who vote for a "pro-choice" position, who still find
abortion morally repugnant, but Judge Souter was not even willing
to say that.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is an interesting observation.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Mr. SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Phillips, on this question, you and Mr. Joseph Rauh, the
leader of the Civil Rights Committee, are in total agreement, that
is, on the rejection of Judge Souter.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Well, let me say, with respect to Mr. Rauh, who is
an estimable warrior for his views, that I believe he and his col-
leagues have gotten far more than they deserved in Judge Souter
and that those on my side of the aisle have gotten far less.
  I would also say that the conservatives in America have a lot to
learn from the civil rights movement, because if President Bush or
President Carter had named to the Supreme Court a man who is a
trustee of a country club, had voted to exclude blacks, that man or
woman would, ipso facto, have been disqualified from service on
the Supreme Court. I would have voted, had I been a Senator,
against a prospective Justice who, as the member of the board of a
country club, had voted to exclude blacks from membership.
  But here is a man who voted for policies which resulted in the
death of many hundreds of unborn children, and I profoundly
regret that there are not right-to-life organizations and conserva-
tive organizations standing up and at least expressing profound
concern about that fact.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Phillips, I start with the proposition of you
and Mr. Rauh in agreement, because it illustrates the difficulty of
the committee, a Senator or the Senate in pleasing everyone or
perhaps in pleasing anyone.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator, with respect, I do not expect you to please
everyone, I expect you to do what your conscience directs you to be
correct.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will do it, I have in the past and will
here.
  I think your testimony is really very important, because you and
the National Organization of Women come to the same conclusion,
that Judge Souter should not be confirmed, that the Senate should
not give its consent, because he displeases you on the abortion
                                      896
issue, just as he displeases illustratively the National Organization
of Women.

  I think your testimony is very important here, because it shows
the very strong feelings which are held by those who are opposed
to abortion. The testimony by the panels yesterday who opposed
Judge Souter's confirmation, because they insist on a commitment
that Roe v. Wade be sustained, was very powerful on the other
side. They did not all insist on that commitment. Some drew a
lesser line, saying they would be satisfied with a commitment to a
liberty principle, and then would be satisfied with the strict scruti-
ny test, in coming to the conclusion.

  But I think it is very important for America to know that there
are those who feel very, very strongly on the principles which you
have just articulated. I had some questioning yesterday about the
sense of where our majority stood and, although the public opinion
polls consistently show that a majority of people do not want an
elimination of abortion. As soon as you start to put qualifications
on it, should there be an abortion by a married woman, married for
a long period of time, the first child conceived, without the hus-
band's consent, then the picture starts to show, for whatever value
the public opinion polls have.

  So, I thank you for your testimony and I just have really one
question for you

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator, before you ask the question, may I re-
spectfully disagree with your analysis.

  Senator SPECTER. Certainly.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. I would say that there is a fundamental distinction
between the groups such as NOW and NARAL and Planned Par-
enthood and so forth which urge a "no" vote on Judge Souter.
Their position is that they are not absolutely certain that Judge
Souter is going to be with them to their satisfaction. I, on the other
hand, am absolutely certain on the basis of the record that Judge
Souter does have a permissive view toward abortion.
  The implication of your prefatory remark was that this is a
single-issue concern, and perhaps it may be for NOW or Planned
Parenthood. I will let them speak for themselves. To me, this tran-
scends any single issue. To me, the heart of the law is--and I speak
as a layman. The heart of the law is that the system of justice is to
prevent the shedding of innocent blood. The purpose of the system
of justice is to protect the innocent.
  The predicate to the Constitution is the Declaration of Independ-
ence which says we are endowed by our Creator, which talks about
a firm reliance on Divine Providence. I believe we all are created
beings and that the unborn child is a created being. And if the
rights of that created being are denied by a person appointed to the
Court, denied in more than a theoretical way, but denied in the
sense that he has actually been complicit in the performance of
abortion, I think you have got something very serious.
  Now, the next statement that I have could be regarded as inflam-
matory, and let me make clear that I am not saying that David
Souter is Adolph Eichmann. That is not what I am saying. But
listen to what I am saying
  Senator SPECTER. YOU are not saying he is what?
                                      897

  Mr. PHILLIPS [continuing]. Adolph Eichmann. But it would be no
more convincing for an Adolph Eichmann to say that his personal
views on gas chambers had no bearing on legal decisions he might
make as a member of a Nazi high court than it is now plausible for
a David Souter to argue that his role as an accomplice to abortion
has no bearing on his suitability to be a Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court.

  Now, different people have different views on whether, in fact,
we have had an abortion holocaust in the United States. I believe
we have. And I believe that it is a profound moral disgrace that
this has been permitted to occur. But I don't think it is enough to
say that this is just another issue. I think it goes to the very heart
of David Souter's character and moral philosophy.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, as a result of what you have just said, I
have a second question.

   Mr. PHILLIPS. Yes, sir.

  Senator SPECTER. I will ask first, you say that you believe that in
what Judge Souter has done he has shown a sympathy for abor-
tion. Is it your personal view--I couldn't ask this of Judge Souter,
but I can ask it of you. Is it your personal view that Judge Souter
will vote to uphold Roe v. Wade?

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator, it would be speculation. Because Judge
Souter approaches legal questions from a positivist perspective
rather than from any theory of natural law, even the kind of
theory which Senator Biden has endorsed, and as he very articula-
tely put forward during the Bork hearings, it is a matter of guess-
work.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you have a guess?
  Mr. PHILLIPS. NO, sir, I don't.
  Senator SPECTER. Last question. If you were sure, had a commit-
ment from Judge Souter that he would vote to reverse Roe v.
Wade, flat commitment that he would reverse Roe v. Wade and
adopt the position that you articulate that abortion ought to be
outlawed, would you change your opposition to his nomination? Or
would you recommend that we not consent on the basis that his
character is fatally flawed by what he did in permitting abortions
in the hospital, as you referred to?
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Well, if he said that he thought abortion should be
outlawed, then he would be changing his view, and I would recom-
mend his appointment. But merely repealing Roe v. Wade will not
necessarily prevent the continuation of massive abortions, conceiv-
ably in every one of the 50 States. All that that will do is return
the process to the State legislatures.
  Senator SPECTER. But if he agreed to reverse Roe, you would rec-
ommend that we consent to his confirmation?
  Mr. PHILLIPS. I would take that into account with other factors.
The focus of my testimony today and the reason that I decided to
request the opportunity to testify relates to his record in authoriz-
ing the performance of abortions. But I have to tell you that I am
troubled by his answers to other questions.
  Frankly, I found his most troubling answer one which he gave to
Senator Thurmond at the very beginning of the hearings, when he
said that the power of the law comes from the people. I don't be-
lieve that. I believe it comes from God. And having read and reread
                                      898
two or three times David Souter's senior honors thesis, it seems to
me that he still believes many of the things that were very much
implied as reflecting his beliefs in that senior honors thesis at Har-
vard. It seems to me that this is a man who totally rejects higher
law authority and that he is purely a legal technician.

  Now, I would not have come here to testify against him but for
the fact that he had been complicit in the performance of abortion
because there are many others far more knowledgable about the
law than I, and the issues would have been better addressed by
others. But even had he given that assurance concerning which
you inquired of me, I still would have been troubled in the context
of his other statements.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I thank you, Mr. Phillips, for your very
profound testimony.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, sir.
  The Chairman. The Senator from New Hampshire, Senator
Humphrey.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome, Mr. Phillips.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I, too, am disturbed about Judge Souter's
participation in the decision by the Concord Board of Trustees to
commence the performance of abortions at that facility. I am dis-
turbed by his view that members of such a board should exercise
no moral judgment in overseeing a hospital. A hospital of all
places, it seems to me, should be subject, its operations should be
subject to moral judgment.
  But I am not sure it is dispositive. I am not sure of anything,
frankly, about Judge Souter. I don't think anyone is. I think he
soft-pedaled his views before this committee. That would only be
human after what happened to Judge Bork. Anthony Kennedy cer-
tainly soft-pedaled his views and turned out to be far better than
his testimony indicated to conservatives, at least, that he would be.
So I am hoping that is the case with Judge Souter.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. I hope you are right.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I will tell you another reason I don't think it
is dispositive. You and I have a friend in this very body who, as a
State legislator back in the mid-1970's, supported pro-abortion leg-
islation. Why? Because he hadn't really given much thought about
it. But once he had, he came to a completely different conclusion. I
think you know about whom I am speaking.
  It is my experience that a lot of adults, intelligent, thinking
adults, have not really thought an awful lot about this because it is
human nature not to think about something as ghastly and as
grisly as chopping up little babies. And the pro-choice slogan is
very appealing. No doubt it was designed by pollsters and consult-
ants. It is very effective. The Americans are for choice. It is demo-
cratic to be for choice. But when you think about what the choice
is, then you have to come to another conclusion.
  My opinion is that Judge Souter, because he has never faced this
kind of case, has never really given it deep thought--and I hope I
am right on that--he at least indicated with regard to the decision
at the Concord Hospital that it did not indicate that he views--that
he rules out personhood for the unborn child. I am paraphrasing
him  now.  He  said  that  s/h!ou' ld  899     taken  as  an  indication.  So  I
                                       not be

am not sure, but I am more inclined to be optimistic on that point
than I think you are.

  However, I do wholeheartedly agree with your views on natural
law. It is just mind-boggling that in this country, of all countries,
we should be splitting hairs to determine who is a person and who
isn't. I mean, in the Soviet Union, at least until recent times, it
was fairly routine for there to be a class of humans who were non-
persons, officially designated--at least, in any event, officially
treated by that government as nonpersons. But in the United
States to invent by splitting hairs a class of nonpersons, a class of
human beings who are nonpersons is one of the great shames in
our history, one of the great tragedies of our history.

  You referred to Justice John Paul Stevens' statement in the
Thornburgh case. You quoted him saying, "There is a fundamental
and well-recognized difference between a fetus and a human being.
Indeed, if there is not such a difference, the permissibility of termi-
nating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of the
State legislatures."

  Did he say more on this subject, or did he just posit that as a
given and move on, that there is a fundamental and well-recog-
nized difference between a fetus and a human being?

  Mr. PHILLIPS. I don't believe he went into detail. If he did, I am
not aware of it.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, it is true, out of ignorance in some
parts of our history, a lot of people have probably believed that
there is a difference between a fetus and a human being. But, like-
wise, during other shameful parts of our history, a lot of people
thought there was a difference between Afro-Americans and citi-
zens of the United States, including Chief Justice Tawney.

  Mr. PHILLIPS. That is right.
  Senator HUMPHREY. And at other times in our history, there
have been a lot of people who thought there was a fundamental
and well-recognized difference between enfranchised males and fe-
males who didn't have the franchise. And just because we did
things wrong for a long period of time didn t mean that women
should go without the vote forever, didn't mean that black Ameri-
cans could be enslaved, and shouldn't mean that unborn human
beings are treated as so much property that can be disposed of at
will.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator, President Lincoln agreed with you. He
was politically active during the period following the Dred Scott de-
cision.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. And he refused to accept the Dred Scott decision as
applying to anything more than the parties to the case. And that is
my view of the Roe v. Wade decision.
  Senator, if I may, I pray that your optimism is well founded. It is
entirely possible that Judge Souter will only now begin to think se-
riously about abortion. I think, however, his statements indicated
that he still felt that his earlier decision was justified.
  Now, you tried to ask him a question at the very end of your ini-
tial interrogation of him about his contact with that young couple
when he was a Harvard law student counseling a young Harvard
                                      900

student and the girlfriend of that student, who had indicated to
him that the young lady was contemplating a self-induced abortion.
And Judge Souter in response to your inquiry and that of other
Senators was very reluctant to reply.

  I find that reluctance to reply in and of itself very troubling. You
know, young people throughout the country look to the Supreme
Court of the United States, not just as the guardian of liberty but
as the guardian of law. And if Judge Souter was unwilling to say
that, yes, he told that young woman to obey the law and to reaf-
firm now that, yes, he told them to obey the law, or that if he told
them to break the law and procure an illegal abortion he was
wrong--if he today is unwilling to say that, then I don't think the
right example will be set for our country if he serves on the Su-
preme Court of the United States.

  Mr. Rauh, speaking for the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, suggested that Mr. Souter be recalled to consider other
questions. I would suggest he be recalled until it be determined
whether as an adult, as a student at Harvard Law School, he ad-
vised a young woman whom he had taken under his professional
care as a proctor to break the law. I think the people are entitled
to know that. And if he did advise her to break the law, the people
are entitled to know whether he now regrets that decision and
would change it.

  Senator HUMPHREY. I think that is a fair observation.
  Well, I want to go back and briefly follow up on the points I at-
tempted to make a moment ago about natural rights and the ridic-
ulousness and the tragedy of trying to construe a distinction be-
tween a human being and a person. With regard to fetology, the
study of the fetus, we have only recently emerged from the dark
ages. The most eminent scientists and jurists thought for a long
time that there was no life until at some moment it was infused
and the mother felt the child move. Quickening used to be the ac-
cepted standard. Now we know that quickening has no particular
significance; that, in fact, the infant is moving well before the
mother can begin to feel it; and that quickening is just one day in
the whole stretch of days of development from conception until
death.
  We have come through a lot of ignorance. That the argument
should be raised in favor of abortion that we should continue to do
things because we have done them this way for a long time, we
have regarded--some people, at least, have regarded the fetus as
something less than human, that we should continue, even though
fetology and medical science have advanced greatly in recent years,
is just preposterous. Just because we used to have slavery doesn't
mean we should continue to have slavery; just because we used to
deny the women the franchise and many other rights doesn't mean
we should continue to do so. Just because out of ignorance people
didn't understand fetology and human development and acquiesced
and practiced abortion doesn't mean we should continue to do so.
  In any event, it ought to be self-evident that the offspring of
human beings are human beings, and under natural law one is en-
dowed--not at birth or some moment convenient to modern society,
but one is endowed when one is created. Otherwise, the Declaration
of Independence is just so much rubbish. If it has no operative
                                      901
status, then let's just declare it rubbish, something we summon up
on the 4th of July. But if it does have operative status, then that
means all of us are endowed by our Creator when we are created,
not at some moment convenient to modern society. And, therefore,
abortion is an abomination and ought to be made an unlawful act,
as it once was.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  I thank you, Mr. Phillips.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Particularly for agreeing to be the clean-up
hitter here.
  Mr. PHILLIPS. I appreciate the opportunity.
  The CHAIRMAN. With that, Mr. Phillips, we excuse you. We ap-
preciate your being here.
  [The prepared statement of Mr. Phillips follows:]
                                     902

                                             Testimony of:
                                           HOWARD PHILLIPS
                      Chairman, The Conservative Caucus, Inc.
                                     450 Maple Avenue, East

                        before the Senate Judiciary Committee
                                    Dirksen Senate Building
                                    Washington, D.C. 20515

                                Tuesday, September 18, 1990

         Mr. Chairman, my name is Howard Phillips. I am chairman of
The Conservative Caucus, a non-profit, public-policy advocacy
organization based in Vienna, Virginia.

         The Declaration of Independence asserted that "We are
endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that,
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
The Declaration rested on the assumption that there exist "the
laws of nature and of nature's God."

         Our law system is necessarily rooted in and legitimated by
that fundamental recognition of higher authority.

         In considering David Souter's suitability to cast what in
many cases will be the deciding opinion on the Supreme Court of
the United States, it is necessary to go beyond Mr. Souter's
intellectual capacity and his stated opinions, and to assess his
character and moral courage in their relationship to the respon-
sibilities of a Supreme Court justice.

         One moment of truth for Mr. Souter came in February, 1973,
when, as a member of the board of trustees of Concord Hospital,
he participated in a unanimous decision that abortions be per-
formed at that hospital.

        Advocacy of, or even acquiescence in, such a decision is
morally distinguishable from the judicial conclusion, profoundly
                                    903

incorrect in my view, that women have a constitutional right to
destroy their unborn children.

         It is also distinguishable from and far more troubling than
the political argument by politicians who maintain that they are
"personally opposed" to abortion even as they advocate its
deeriminalization.

         It is one thing to intellectually rationalize the case for
permitting legal abortions while still opposing the exercise of
such legal authority; it is quite another something far more
invidious morally to actually join in a real world decision to
cause abortions to be performed, routinely, at a particular
hospital.

        Those abortions whose performance was authorized by David
Souter were not mandated by law or court opinion. In fact, laws
have remained to this day on the books in New Hampshire which
provide criminal penalties for any "attempt to procure miscar-
riage" or "intent to destroy quick child". Indeed, section
585:14 of the New Hampshire Criminal Code establishes the charge
of second degree murder for the death of a pregnant woman in
consequence of an attempted abortion.

        Nor were those abortions which Mr. Souter authorized per-
formed merely to save the life of the mother. Nor were they
limited to cases of rape or incest.

         If the unborn child is human, and if innocent human life is
to be defended and safeguarded, why did Mr. Souter acquiesce in
those abortions? Why did he not speak out against them? Why did
he, through 12 years on the Concord Hospital board in a position
of responsibility, help cause those abortions to be performed,
and invest his personal reputation in clearly implied approval of
those abortions?

         The overarching moral issue in the political life of the
United States in the last third of the Twentieth Century is the
question of abortion.
                                      904

         Is the unborn child a human person entitled to the protec-
tions pledged to each of us by the founders of our nation?

         The issue is much more than one of legal or judicial philos-
ophy. There are men and women in the legal profession, in
elected office, and on the bench who acknowledge abortion to be
morally repugnant, but who assert that, in present circumstances,
it cannot be constitutionally prohibited.

         Whatever Mr. Souter's legal and judicial philosophy may be
(and, on the record, it seems to be one which rejects the higher
law theories implicit in the Declaration of Independence), it is
a chilling fact which the Senate must consider that Souter has
personally participated in decisions resulting in the performance
of abortions where such abortions were in no way mandated or re-
quired by law or court decision.

         By his own account, Mr. Souter served as a member of the
board of trustees for the Concord Hospital from 1971 until 1985.
Following service as board secretary, he was president of the
board from 1978 to 1984.

         In 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court's January 22 Roe v.
Wade decision, the Concord Hospital trustees voted to initiate a
policy of performing abortions at Concord Hospital.

         Similarly, Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital (which is associated
with the Dartmouth Medical School of which Judge Souter has been
an overseer) has performed abortions up to the end of the second
trimester.

         During the period of Mr. Souter's tenure as a decision-maker
of these two institutions, many hundreds of abortions were
performed under his authority with no indication that he ever
objected to or protested the performance of these abortions.
Even though the Roe v. Wade decision did in fact authorize
abortions through the ninth month of pregnancy, nothing in the
Supreme Court's decision required or obliged any hospital to
conduct abortions, whether in the ninth month, the sixth month,
or even the first month of pregnancy.
                                     905

         If Judge Souter is confirmed as a justice of the Supreme
Court, he will, in all likelihood, be given the opportunity to
address not only the issue of Roe v. Wade, but broader issues
involving the sanctity of innocent human life.

         Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the 1986 Thornburgh v.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists case: "There
is a fundamental and well recognized difference between a fetus
and a human being. Indeed, if there is not such a difference,
the permissibility of terminating the life of a fetus could
scarcely be left to the will of the state legislatures."

         Mr. Stevens was wrong in a very deadly way.
         If an unborn child is not human, I would ask Justice
Stevens, "What is he?" "What is she?" But at least Mr. Stevens
was logical in defending his support for the majority opinion in
Roe v. Wade.
         In the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court indicated
that, if the unborn child iji a person, the state could not allow
abortion even to save the life of the mother. In fact, in the
majority opinion deciding Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court said
that "if the personhood of the unborn child is established, the
pro-abortion case 'collapses', for the fetus's right to life is
then guaranteed specifically by the Fourteenth Amendment."
         As Notre Dame law Professor Charles Rice has pointed out,
"This is so, because the common law does not permit a person to
kill an innocent non-aggressor, even to save his own life."
         Does David Souter believe that the unborn child the fetus
in the mother's womb is a human person, deserving of all the
protections which are guaranteed to human beings after the moment
of birth?
         Seemingly, Mr. Souter's answer is an unequivocal "no". By
agreeing that abortions be performed at institutions under his
authority, Mr. Souter established clearly that he did not recog-
nize the personhood of the unborn child, for surely, if he did
acknowledge the unborn child to be a human person, Mr. Souter
                                     906

would not have agreed to authorize the extinguishment of so many
precious lives at medical facilities for which he bore responsi-
bility.

         One must conclude that either Mr. Souter accepts the view
that the life of the unborn child is of less value than the
convenience and profit of those who collaborate in the killing of
that child, or that, despite his recognition of the fact that
each unborn child is human, a handiwork of God's creation, he
lacked the moral courage or discernment to help prevent the
destruction of so many innocent human lives when he had the
authority indeed the responsibility to do so.

         Either way, in such circumstances, unless there are mitigat-
ing factors or extenuating considerations which have not yet been
brought to public attention, it is difficult to regard Mr. Souter
as one suitable for participation in judicial decisions at the
highest level of our nation.

         If, during his years of responsibility at Concord Hospital
and Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital, Mr. Souter believed each fetus
to be a human person, and failed to act against the performance
of abortion, he was morally delinquent.

         If, on the other hand, he justified himself by denying the
human qualities of the unborn child, then he placed himself in
the ambit of those who have argued against the very philosophy
which his sponsor, President George Bush, purported to embrace
during his 1988 presidential candidacy.

         On the basis of the information now available, Mr. Souter
should not be confirmed.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me make a few very brief closing statements.
I would like to personally thank the nominee and the witnesses
who appeared before this committee, and my colleagues. As I indi-
cated at the outset of this hearing, I have never imposed and I will
not impose a gag rule on any Senator asking any questions. And
there were some questions asked that I am sure the nominee would
rather have not had asked. And there were some questions asked,
in my view, of some of the witnesses that became very contentious,
and I am sure from the standpoint of the witnesses they had
reason to believe that and found them offensive.
  Nonetheless, I think the witnesses and all those who testified
conducted themselves with a great deal of decorum and respect.
And I hope that on those occasions when they felt that any
member of the committee was being overzealous that they put it in
the same context in which they were giving their testimony.
  This is a nomination that has obviously stirred a great deal of
interest and concern. It would not matter, quite frankly, who was
nominated by the President at this moment in our history, for this
is one of those crossroads, one of those crossroads in American ju-
risprudential history, because, to state the obvious, whomever is
put on the Court in the near term will determine by himself or
herself the course of action, the policy this Nation will follow in
the near term on some extremely important issues. That seldom
happens so graphically, so clearly, and, quite frankly, without any
ability to be refuted--the statement, that is, that the course of
America will be affected by whomever we put on the bench.
  There are so many split decisions, and when you take Justice
Brennan off the bench, there are a number of significant decisions
that, in fact, are now 4 to 4. And what this Justice, whomever he
or she may be, does--the next Justice--will impact in a way that
few other nominations have in our history. And so the emotion, the
intellectual curiosity and concern, sometimes the anger, always the
commitment of those who spoke before us over these last days in
my view are totally and completely understandable.
  I hope the witnesses and the public feel that they have had every
opportunity to make their case and have not in any way been cur-
tailed in expressing their emotion. As I said, I want to thank the
witnesses because they have, quite frankly, contained themselves.
You can see in the eyes of some of the witnesses who testified here
today, not only a concern but a fear--a fear that that which they
hold dear is now in jeopardy, from both sides of the spectrum. And
that is understandable.
  Again, I want to thank my colleagues--notwithstanding the
moment being the exception--for their incredible attendance
during this process. And I want to thank the staffs, of the minority
and the majority. As I know the professionals in this room who
follow these processes lmow, an incredible amount of work goes in
to setting up the mere logistics as well as the intellectual frame-
work within which this debate, discussion, and inquiry takes place.
Hundreds and hundreds of hours, and I want to thank you all, all
of you, on both sides of the aisle, for the phenomenal job that you
did.
  And I want to thank the stenographer. She is always, I think,
when she sees me--and we have more than one stenographer, obvi-
                                      908

ously--but when she sees me or when most of them see me, they
see Biden, they say, oh, my God, I suspect you might think there is
Old Ironpants, he is going to just keep going and going and going
until it gets done. And so I want to thank you today for staying
through lunch, and I know it is not easy.

  And I want to thank the photographers because, in fact, I did ini-
tiate something that they pray will not become a practice, and that
is, by not allowing any photographer anywhere here in the well
when the primary witness was here, when the nominee was here.
And I hope they will forgive me, but we will soon know in time
whether or not how many pictures you see with me with my finger
pointed and my mouth open, compared to those which you do not
see that way. But, all kidding aside, ladies and gentlemen, photog-
raphers, I want to thank you very much. You were gracious about
it. Although you were persistent, you were gracious.

  And, lastly, I want to indicate that, as has been my practice as
chairman--and not only my practice, I suspect. I think it goes back
further than that. Several of my colleagues have questions that
they wish to submit to Judge Souter, colleagues who are not on the
committee. And I have indicated in the past, as I do now, as long as
they are not questions designed to delay the process, I will submit
those questions. Senator Levin has submitted some questions, and
there are a few others. There are not more than half a dozen ques-
tions, some of which I may submit as well, that will be submitted.
And we will give the nominee plenty of time to answer them prior
to this consideration before the committee.

  [The questions follow:]

The Honorable David Souter

Concord, New Hampshire 03301

Dear Judge Souter:

         As I stated at the close of hearings on your nomination,
the committee's practice in the past has been to allow Senators
who are not members of the Judiciary Committee to submit
written questions to Supreme Court nominees. Accordingly, I am
enclosing several questions, on behalf of Senator Levin.

1. You testified that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a
right to privacy. Aside from the issue of reproductive rights,
do you believe that the privacy right of an individual, as
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, is affected by his or
her marital status?

2. It's my understanding that you are an admirer of Justice
Holmes. Would you give your comments on the aphorism from
Holmes' Common Law: "the life of the law has not been logic;
it has been experience"?

3. Which two U.S. presidents and which two Supreme Court
justices of the last fifty years do you most admire, and why?

4. Senator Biden asked you whether you agreed that procreation
is a fundamental right, as the Supreme Court'decided in Skinner
in the 1940's. You replied that the right to procreate would
be at the heart of any core concept of marital privacy.
Putting marital status aside, do you believe that procreation
is a fundamental right?

         I would appreciate receiving your answers as soon as
possible. Thank you for your cooperation.

                                                         J

                                                         Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

                                       FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

                        September 24, 1990

                                                              CONCORD, NH 03302-2339

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Thank you for your letter of September 19 with four questions
from Senator Levin. My responses follow.

1. I testified that the liberty protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment includes a right of privacy, and I spoke of a concept
of marital privacy as clearly falling within the protected right.
Because the concern for privacy has thus far focused so
significantly on reproductive choice, and because cases
implicating such choice by married and by unmarried individuals
will probably come before the Supreme Court in the near future, I
respectfully declined to speak on the likely weighting of privacy
interests in such a matter. I believe that I must continue to
take this position, lest I comment inappropriately on an issue
that could call for my ruling if my nomination is confirmed.

2. Holmes's aphorism speaks to a central truth about our law: it
is not a closed system of neatly consistent rules, but a set of
principles derived from human experience, with claims to
legitimacy that may come into conflict with each other. What a
theorist might criticize as an objectionable untidiness is in
fact the law's reflection of the divergent human needs and
aspirations that call it into being.

3. As for the two most admirable justices of the past fifty
years, I will exclude anyone living from consideration. Of those
who are now gone, I most admire Justices Harlan and Frankfurter.
Neither was without a flawed decision, but each has taught us
lessons about the proper scope of the judiciaj. function within
the tripartite division of governmental power in a constitutional
democracy. Justice Harlan repeatedly spoke to the need for a
disciplined search for constitutional values independent of our
merely personal preferences, and Justice Frankfurter's
concurrence in the Court's unanimous opinion in Brown v. Board of
Education reminded us that a proper sense of judicial restraint
should be no counsel against the forthright enforcement of clear
constitutional principle. As to admirable presidents of the past
half-century, a response would take me into a sphere of political
comment that I think would be inappropriate for me to make, given
that I am a member of the judiciary.

4. I think this question about the significance of the
procreative choice outside the marital context arguably might
raise some of the same issues raised by question one. The same
concern that led me to believe that I must decline to respond
                                   911

further to that first question applies here as well, and I ask to
be excused from speaking to this question beyond the analysis
that I gave to the Committee in my earlier testimony.
Let me mention again, Mr. Chairman, my appreciation of the many
kindnesses that you and your colleagues have shown to me. Thank
you.

                                             Yours respectfully,

                                             David H. Souter

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
Chairman
United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary
224 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510
!  912

  The CHAIRMAN. I also want to point out that Senator Thurmond,
who, as we said, is necessarily absent at this moment, would like to
have statements allowed to be submitted for the record, and I will
allow that to occur, by any member of the committee who wishes to
make a closing statement here.

  Last, I l^now the question because I have been fastidious in
making sujre not to speak to the press or attend any press confer-
ences or hold any--and I have no intention of doing that at the
close of this process either. One of the questions that you will have
and the public may have is: When is this nomination likely to be
voted on in the committee? It is my hope and expectation--since
tomorrow we have our executive sessions on Thursday. That is a
fancy phrase for the public to say that is when in committee we
meet and we vote on things like nominations. It is my expectation,
although there is no final judgment made, that the executive ses-
sion at which time we would begin to consider for purposes of vote
in this committee the nomination of David Souter would be prob-
ably sometime the end of next week, which would be in the normal
course of events. We seldom ever that I can think of have an execu-
tive session immediately upon the close of a hearing. And so it will
probably be next Thursday, but I will work out with the minority
leadership what date that will occur.

  With that, I thank you all for your intense interest and concern,
and once again mostly thank the witnesses for their courtesy.

  There is one other thing. There are statements that have been
submitted by individuals who wish to testify, but they were not
given the time to testify, which, again, is the practice of the com-
mittee. They are written statements that have been submitted for
the record. They will be entered in the record along with the wit-
nesses' testimony so that we are sure that we have the view of all
those who wish to express a view, whether it be in writing or orally
before the committee.

  [Please see appendix for additional statements.]
  The CHAIRMAN. With that, thank you all for your patience. The
committee is adjourned.
  [Whereupon, at 2:18 p.m., the committee was adjourned, subject
to the call of the Chair.]

                       CONSIDERING THE NOMINATION OF
                               JUDGE DAVID SOUTER

                     AS JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
                                  914

          As in my previous appearance before this committee, 1 wish to
  express my appreciation for granting me the opportunity to appear
  before you today to testify in these important hearings considering
  the nomination of Judge David Souter.

          My name is John J. Bellizzi. Currently I serve as the Executive
  Director of the International Narcotic Enforcement Officers Association
   (INEOA) which is an organization composed basically of narcotic enforce-
  ment officers from all levels of government and from throughout the
  United States and 50 other countries.

           I appear here today on behalf of 12,000 members and thousands of
  other drug enforcement officials throughout the United States.

           Recently drug traffickers have suffered some serious setbacks as
  a result of an intensified and concentrated effort by law enforcement.

           The impact of the multitude of seizures of drugs, money and other
  assets brought about by successful investigations, arrests and prosecutions
  has put such a dent in the illegal trafficking operations that by furious
  retaliation the traffickers are committing assaults, violence and murder
  on our drug agents and other officials responsible for drug enforcement.

           Narcotic law enforcement agents have always operated under high risk
  conditions, but recent events have created a situation where their lives
  are at stake constantly and these men and women deserve to be recognized
   for their dedicated service.

           The thousands of drug enforcement agents who risk their lives
   each time they set out on a drug investigation are dedicated. Notwith-
   standing the imminent risk they face, they are not the least dissuaded
   from performance of duty.

        These officers and their family members are very much concerned
that they receive the same equal protection, the same constitutional
rights, the same constitutional protection afforded to any suspect,
defendant or prisoner charged with the commission of the crime.

        I wish to make it clear that by this endorsement we do not seek
to ingratiate ourselves with Judge Souter or the court. We seek no
favor, we seek no special privileges. What we do seek is protection
of the constitutional rights of the accused and we also seek protection
of the constitutional rights of our law-abiding citizens and of our law
enforcement agents.

         1 submit that by his record Judge Souter has demonstrated that
he is capable and indeed willing to do just that - ensure equal protection
to all regardless of race, color, sex, religious or social background.
                                 915

        The matter of Judge Souter's nomination and record was reviewed
by the 50 members of the Board of Directors of INEOA representing the
general membership.

        The board has found that Judge Souter is an outstanding nominee
for the Supreme Court.

        Judge Souter is a tough, anti-crime judge. Prior to his appointment
to his state's Supreme Court, he served as a hands-on trial court judge,
and a New Hampshire's Attorney General -- the state's chief law enforce-
ment official. Because of this experience, he has-a practical under-
standing of the problems that face prosecutors and police, and takes a
common-sense approach to questions of criminal law and procedure.

         In society's battle against drug traffickers, he has supported
the consitutional use of "pen registers," a highly effective law enforce-
ment tool that's enabled police to track down drug kingpins by identifying
the phone numbers of those who supply street-level drug dealers. (State v.
Valenzuela, 536 A.2d 1252 (N.H. 1987)).

         Protecting the lives and safety of citizens who act to assist
the police, he has, in appropriate circumstances, shielded the names
of police informants from unnecessary disclosures. (State v. Svoleantopoulos,
 543 A.2d 410 (N.H. 1988); State v. Cote, 493 A.2d 1252 (N.H. 1985)).

         Early on, Judge Souter took a common sense, constitutional stand
 to protect our citizens from what the President has called "one of the
most deadly scourges ever to strike modern times" -- drunk driving.

         Judge Souter has resisted the arguments of those who would tip
 the scales of justice further in favor of criminal wrong-doers. He has
 been reluctant to impose new, judgemade requirements that would be
 tougher on police than they would be on criminals.

         Judge Souter's approach to criminal law issues is informed both
 by his considerable experience as a public law enforcement officer and
 his deep understanding of the community's interest in combatting crime.

         He has consistently demonstrated a strong willingness to defer to
 the decisions of legislators, prosecutors and police so long as those
 decisions do not infringe on the constitutional rights of criminal
 defendants.

         After careful consideration, the 50 member Board of Directors,
 representing the general membership of INEOA, unanimously endorsed and
 supports the nomination of Judge David Souter as Justice to the United
 States Supreme Court.

(Statement of Frank Brown, professor of economics, DePaul University, and
Chairman, National Association for Personal Rights in Education (NAPRE) to
the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on the nomination hearings on Judge David
Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court, Washington, D.C., September, 1990).

                                  THE SCHOOLING RIGHTS OF FAMILIES

        In presenting this statement to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on
the confirmation of Judge David Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court, the
National Association for Personal Rights in Education (NAPRE), a parental
group, wishes to concentrate on its main purpose, namely, the attainment of
the personal civil and constitutional rights of parents, guardians, and
children to equitable shares of the education taxation to enroll in the
elementary and secondary schools, state or private, including church-related,
of their choice.

        We have not been able to uncover the views of Judge Souter on this
matter, but, hearing that he is a scholar willing to listen, we here
summarize for his consideration some ways by which the personal rights of
millions of parents and children to education tax equity have been denied
over the past 150 years by legislatures and courts, including the U.S.
Supreme Court. We ask four questions.

        A. WHAT PRINCIPLES SHOULD PREVAIL IN THE SCHOOLING OF CHILDREN?

        First, the family, as prime educator of its children, has the right to
enroll them in schools in accord with their academic and religious
convictions and, if taxed for schooling, the right to direct a share to
schools of choice. Second, the state may assist parents to elect schools,
public or private, through reasonable taxation but may not take control of
schooling. Third, other educators, including churches, have the right to
conduct schools and to be recipients of the tuition grants provided to
families by the state.

        B. WHERE DID THE AMERICAN STATE GO WRONG?

        All the other democracies of the West have generally respected these
principles but the American state has violated them by taking a monopoly of
the education taxes for its own schools, by denying shares to parents seeking
schooling elsewhere, and by economically undermining private educators,
including churches.

        The prototype of this new institution was the Massachusetts system
engineered in the mid-19th century by Horace Mann and his Unitarian allies.
About this time many other state school systems were developed by the
dominant Protestants of the time, as in Illinois in 1855, with help from
Knownothingism.

        Protestants had heretofore largely relied on the church as the school-
teacher of their children, but, having split into many sects, hit upon the
scheme, of uniting behind a tax-supported Protestant public school, with
dissenters being told that they could go elsewhere, but of course without any
of the education tax, including their own.

        In his The Lively Experiment: The Shaping of Christianity in America
Professor Sydney Mead, a champion of the new arrangement, concluded that the
public school is the American established church. The church-state tie-ins
were presumably avoided by describing the new school as nonsectarian and
therefore entitled to a monopoly of the education tax, while Catholic and
Lutheran schools were branded as sectarian and therefore ineligible for tax
                                    917

benefits. Unfortunately this distinction based on political muscle rather
than on constitutional logic still prevails in U.S. Supreme Court thinking.

        This early public school had many good things such as the intellectual
traditions of the West, formation of moral character rooted in religious
principles, and development of the human capital to offer those who
accepted its Protestant orientation.

        But this school is not the public school of today, because sweeping
educational reversals have undermined its original purposes, with two heading
the list, first, the psychological behavioristic teachings of Wundt, Hall,
Dewey, Skinner, Watson and others and, second, the expansion of secular
humanism. Many observers contend that such changes have contributed greatly
to intellectual and moral decline in this society. Still the public school
is the established church.

Education Necessary? and NEA: Troian Horse in American Education; Everhart,

Non-Public School; Klass, Lance J., The Leipzig Connection; McCarthy et al.,
Society. State and Schools; Ravitch, Diane, The Great School Wars; and
Schlafly, Phyllis, Child Abuse in the Classrooms.)

        C. WHERE DID THE U.S. SUPREME COURT GO WRONG?

        The U.S. Supreme Court has done some laudable things in defense of
parental choice, with two examples being the Pierce case (1925), which struck
down an Oregon law designed to coerce all children into the state public
schools and Mueller v. Allen (1983), which upheld an income tax deduction
applicable to families in both public and private schools, In addition,
Justices Rehnquist, White, and Burger have struck many blows for parental
choice.

        But in general the Court record has been disastrous, starting with the
"obiter dictum" of Justice Hugo Black in the Everson case (1947) in which he
said, "The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means
at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can aid. . . all
religions. . . "

        Through this statement, which effectively outlawed state nonpreferential
aid to religion, Black created new constitutional doctrine to block education
tax equity to children in church-related schools and more broadly to justify
separation of state and religion, both goals rooted in his personal belief
that the state should not aid religion in any way.

        He did not consult two crucial First Amendment sources that would have
destroyed his interpretation, first, the Annals which reported on the
congressional hearings on the Bill of Rights, and, second, Elliot's Debates,
which gave the reports of the various state conventions on the adoption of
the Federal constitution and which demonstrated that establishment means
government preference for one church or religion.

        We are outraged that the U.S. Supreme Court has honored the First

D. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

We respectfully submit the following thoughts:

        A. The respective schooling rights of families, the state, and private
educators, including churches, must be clarified and asserted.

        B. The concept of one state public school was not an putgrowth of
American democracy, which had rather given great impetus to private
education, but was imported from the Prussian state system by Horace Mann.

        There is no neutral state public school. Every school, whether called
public or private, is both public and private, public in teaching academic
content and private in offering its own educational environment.

        It is not necessary to have one state public school for all children.
The goal of public education can be achieved through a combination of state
and private schools, with families allowed choice through parental grants
(tuition vouchers, tuition reimbursements, tuition tax credits with
refundability provisions, etc.).

        C. The First Amendment should be thoroughly reexamined, expecially by
the U.S. Supreme Court. Hugo Black should not be allowed to get away with
his distortions of this national asset.

        Keep in mind that when the state moves into the field of schooling it
moves into the field of religion, because for many families schooling is an
integral part of their religious beliefs.

        Distinctions must be made between a tax to support a private matter like
the building of a church and a tax to pursue a public purpose such as
schooling, which for many citizens through conscience can be achieved only
within a religious environment.

        The personal civil and constitutional rights of parents and children to
academic freedom, religious liberty, property, and equal protection of the
laws stand on their own constitutional merits and may not be diminished or
destroyed by reason of any relationship between the state and any church or
school.

 Dear Ms. Shafroth:

The following affidavit is forwarded at the request of Mr. Ted Hoff, for use in the

confirmation hearings concerning Judge David Souter:

My first experience with David Souter's acts and policies was in connection with my
work as a Registered Professional Engineer in solar energy and the ecology and as a
Constitutional Consultant. In early 1977, I was asked to assist 3 people who had been
arrested for soliciting signatures for antinuclear, pro safe energy petitions in
New Hampshire, on the street outside a state liquor store, while state employees in

                               I
state businesss hours in the state liquor store solicited signatures for pro nuclear
power petitions to be sent to Washington to support the efforts of a private enterprise,
Public Service Company of New Hampshire, (PSCo) now bankrupt, and then Governot Mel-
drin Thomson to obtain licenses from the NRC and sell stock in the construction of
2 privately-owned nuclear power plants, Seabrook I and II, on a public road in Seabrook.
I recommended that a petition for writ of habeas corpus be presented to a state judge,
and if that didn't work, to a federal judge, because the 3 people were being held on
unconstitutional charges. I was told that the 3 arrestees were being moved from jail to
jail, thwarting any effort to serve the writ, once obtained. A federal civil rights
 complaint prepared later was successful; the 3 were awarded $1,300 each for violations
 of their rights of free speech and petition and the unconstitutional imprisonment. See
 clipping, enclosed (Ex. A ) .
 My next experience with theleadershlp of then Attorney General Souter was on April 30-
 May 2, 1977, when I and approximately 2,000 other peaceful pro solar, antinuclear power

                                                                           -1-

pollution protestors in a walk from Sal isbury Mass, to Seabrook, along Route 1. When
we arrived outside the Seabrook nuclear site, we were ordered off the road and onto a rough
parking area on the site by Col. Paul Doyon, NH State Police. This took about 3 hours,
total.
The next day, several hundred state troopers from 5 states and NH National Guardsmen
started to occupy the exit from the parking lot. We were informed by bull horn that we
would be arrested for trespass if we did not collect our gear and leave the site and
disperse. (This was a physical impossibility, even £>r those of us who had marched 5 miles
per hour with full field packs under arms in the infantry in WWII.) Col. Doyon stood
alone in the parking area, facing us, for some time, so I went out and talked ..with
him. Col. Doyon stated he had ordered us off the road and onto the site the day before
for the purposes of public safety and to speed up- traffic on Route 1. We were arrested.
The next day, May 2, I was taken in one of the bus loads of protestors, photographed and
fingerprinted, and brought before a local (District) judge. None of us had committed any
violent acts, or offered any resistance.
We were not informed of any rights, nor were we given counsel of our choice when we
asked. I stated I wished to "stand mute"and not make any plea; the judge entered a plea
of "not guilty" to "Trespass." I later asked for bail, which had been set at $100 for
all those from out-of-state but was told I would have to get it "later" and was taken to
Manchester National Guard Armory. I was without food all day; the conditions were unsanitary
In the evening I finally obtained bail at $46 for a $100 bond, and left Manchester.
Since ttere were serious constitutional questions involved, I prepared a report and gave
it to the Hyannis FBI agent, with a copy to the Falmouth Enterprise. A copy of the May
10, 1977 article, from microfilm, is eniosed. (Ex. B.)
At my trial in District Court, I attempted to raise the defenses of competing harms and
entrapment, and question the ownership of the land on which the poser plant was to be
built. I was found guilty, and appealed "de novo." Two years later, the charges were disrai-t
ssed against the 800 of us not tried in the Superior Court.

                         I

I filed suit in the U S District Court in Concord (Denman v. Thomson, et a l ) . The U S
                                                                             -2-
                                          921

District Judge ordered that the question of ownership of the land on which the reactors

were to be built be determined in the New Hanjshire courts. I then intervened in PSCoNH's

civil case for restraining orders in the Rockingham County Superior Court, since PSCoNH

had claimed ownership of the land at issue in that case. 1 was pro se; an Assistant

Attorney General of New Hampshire helped defend the private corporation, FSCoNH. 1 had

the restraining order dissolved in 1980.

In most states, it is not customary to sentence a first-time offender with no previous

record to the maximum sentence (30 days), but to suspend the sentence or "file" the

case without finding. I am informed that AG Souter, representing the Executive Branch

ofthe New Hampshire government, invaded the Judicial Branch's responsibilities by

urging the District Judges sentence the Seabrook protestors to the maximum period.

He did not urge the judges to enforce the U S Constitution and laws, or enforce the

"competing harms" statute, nor did he prosecute PSCoNH officials for false statements

in the selling of stock and "shares" of Seabrook future power, about the safety and

cheapness of nuclear power.

Although ten Attorney General Souter knew, or could have known, of previous atomic power

disasters at Idaho Falls, Chalk River, Canada, Lagoona Beach, Michigan, and Windscale,

(now named Sellafield) England, as anyone with an honest interest in safe, cheap power

could determine, he made no effort to control, limit, or prevent these breaches of

Constitutional rights and federal laws in the construction of Seabrook, but instead,

by his actions, showed that he was operating the Attorney General's office as lawyers

for a private corporation, PSCoNH, and used the State Police, and Rockingham County

and local police as private security guards for this private profit endeavor.

He made no effort to stop Gov. Thomson's environmental department officials in their

dynamiting of hydroelectric dams in order to create more "demand" for Seabrook's nuclear

power, a clear violation of the US antitrust laws.

Since David Souter violated the US Constitu tion and laws to promote a dangerous and

expensive private nuclear power project, he should not be confirmed.

                  508- 548-3295

STATEMENT OF ENGINEER NATHANIEL DENMAN RE FITNESS OF DAVID SOUTER
                         TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT

The following statement is made under the penalty of perjury, this date, Sept. 7, 1990,
in accordance with the laws of Massachusetts concerning affidavitsj

In early 1977, in connection with my work as a Registered Professional Engineer and
Constitutional Consultant,I was asked to assist three people who had been arrested for
soliciting signatures for antinuclear, pro safe energy petitions in New Hampshire
on the sidewalk outside a state liquor store. State officials, during st ate office
hours in the state liquor stores were soliciting signatures for pro nuclear power
petitions to be sentto Washington in support of a private enterprise, Public Service*
Company of New Hampshire (PSCo), now bankrupt, and then Governor Meldrim Thomson to ob-
tain licenses from the NRC and sell stock in 2 privately-owned nuclear power plants be-
ing built on a public road in Seabrook, all under the supervision of David Souter, then
Attorney General of New Hampshire.

I recommended a petition for writ ofhabeas corpus be presented toa state judge, and, if
not honored, toa federal judge, as the 3 people were being held on unconstitutional
char ges while the state liquor employees illegally solicited signatures. I was told the
3 arrestees were being moved from jail tojail thwarting efforts to serve the writs. A
later federal civil rights suit was successful) the 3 were awarded $1,300 each for
violations of free speech andpetitioning rights and unconstitutional imprisonment. (See
clipping below.)

The next encounter with David Souter's leadership was on April 30-May 2, 1977, when I and
2,000 other peaceful pro solar, antinuclear power pollution protestors walked 3 miles
from Salisbury Mass, to Seabrook in about 3 hours along Route 1. When we arrived outside
the nuclear site, we were ordered off the road and onto a r ough parking area on the site
by Col. Paul Doyon of the NH State Police.

The next day, May 1, several hundred state troopers from 5 states and NH National
Guardsmen blocked the exit from the parking lot without warning. We were told by bull
horn that we would be arrested for trespass if we did not pack our gear and 7oave the
site and disperse in 30 minutes. (A physical impossibility, even for those of us who
had marched 5 miles per hour with full field packs under arms in WWII,) Col. Doyon
stood alone in the parking area facing us, so I went out and talked to him. He said he
ordered us off the r»ad and onto the site for the purpose of publiesafety and to speed
up traffic on Route 1. We offered no resistance; we were arrested. Some of us were seized
and dragged over rocks and 18" logs in the parking lot at a dead run. Reporters and TV
cameramen were detained or arrested.

Early in the morning of May 2, I was t aken in a busload of protestors, photog raphed and
fingerprinted, and brought before a local judge. We were not informed of any rights, nor
given counoel of our choice. I asked to "stand mote" without a pleaj the judge entered a
plea of "not guilty" to "trespass." I later asked for bail, set at $100 for those from out
of state, and was told Iwould get it "later." I was taken to the Manchester National
Guard Armory by Guardsmen with their name tags covered over who refused to give their
names. I x»s without food all day; the conditions were unsanitary. In the evening I fin-
ally obtained bail at $41 fof the $100 bond.

Since there were serious constitutional and antitrust violations, in this state effort
to promote atomic power at the expense of other energy sources and the environment, I
prepared a reportfor the Hyannis, mass. FBI agent, with a copy to the Falmouth Enterprise.

At my trial in the NH court, I attempted unsuccessfully toraise the defenses of "competing
                                        923

harms" and entrapment and question the ownership of the land involved. I was found
guilty without a jury, and appealed "de novo." Two years later, the charges against
800 of us were dismissed. I filed suit in the US District Court in Concord, NH, (Denman
v. Thomson, et al) and the US District Judge ordered that the question of ownership of
the land be tried in the NH courts. I then intervened in PSCo's petition for restraining
orders in the Rockingham County Superior Court, and moved to have the restraining order
dissolved. I was pro se; An Assistant AG of New Hampshire helped defend the private
Corporation. The restraining order was dissolved.

In most states, it is unusual to sentence a first-time trespassing offender to the
maximum sentence, JO days, but to suspend sentence or "file" the case without findings.
I am informed that Souter, representing the Executive Branch of the NH government, in-
vaded the Judicial Branch's responsibilities and authority by urging the NH judges to
sentence the Seabrook protestors to the maximum sentence. He did not urge the judges
to enforce the US Constitution and laws; he did not protect the people and ecology of
NH; he did not prosecute PSCo officials for false statements in the selling of Seabrook
and PSCo stock and "shares'1 in future Seabrook power re safety and cheapness of nuclear
power. He made no effort to stop Gov. Thomson's environmental officials in the smas-
hing of hydroelectric dams to create more "demand" for Seabrook's nuclear power, a
clear violation of US antitrust laws, and an unusual reaction by a self-proclaimed
"environmentalist."

Attorney General Souter knew about previous atomic power disasters at Idaho Falls in
Nov. 55 (EBR-1 reactor) and Jan. 61 (SL-1 reactor, 3 men died), Chalk River, Canada
(NRX reactor) in Dee 52, the Fermi reactor near Detroit in Oet 66, and Windscale (now
called Sellafield), England in Oct 57» but he made no effort to control, limit, or
prevent these breaches of Constitutional rights and federal laws in the construction
and licensing of Seabrook, but instead, by his actions, showed that he was operating
the Attorney General's office as a law firm and private prosecutors and the State Police
and National suard and local police as private security guards for this private profit
endeavor. His behavior paralleled the actions of Nazi SS officers when Hitler rose to
power in Germany in the 1930's.

Since David Souter violated the US Constitution and laws when sworn to preserve,
protect, and defend them as Attorney General of New Hampshire, and failed to protect
the people and ecology of New Hampshire and New England, he should not be confirmed.

Dated Sept. 7, 1990 at Falmouth, Mass.

   Justice David Souter's Criminal Justice Cases

'            Joseph D. Grano

         At the request of Thomas L. Jipping, Legal Affairs Analyst,
Coalitions for America, I have reviewed 72 New Hampshire Supreme
Court opinions written by Justice David H. Souter in the areas of
substantive criminal law and criminal procedure. I also have
examined a few cases not on the list provided me. I chose these
additional cases either because the issue presented was related
to criminal justice or because Justice Souter wrote a separate
opinion. My analysis of this body of case law follows.

I. Overview

         Justice Souter is a knowledgeable and conscientious judge
who seeks to identify precisely the issues before the court and
to treat these issues fairly in accordance with applicable prece-
dent. When statutes are involved, he seeks to ascertain the
intended meaning of the provision at issue rather than to achieve
his own policy objectives. Indeed, because he refrains from
reaching out to decide issues not presented by the parties and
from offering gratuitous remarks, Justice Souter's opinions give
little insight into his personal values or politics. Clear,

            Distinguished Professor of Law, Wayne State University,
Detroit, Michigan.
                                     925

always well-reasoned, and concise, his opinions contain little,
if any, dicta.

        In analyzing Justice Souter's opinions, one must keep in
mind the nature of the cases that came before him. Because New
Hampshire lacks an intermediate appellate court, its Supreme
Court decides many appeals that the highest courts of other
states would not bother to review, one would expect, therefore,
a relatively high affirmance rate in criminal cases, similar to
that usually found in the intermediate appellate courts of other
states. By the same token, one would expect a lower reversal
rate than usually found in state supreme courts that are free to
choose, on the basis of difficulty or importance, the cases they
will review. One also would expect to find less complexity in,
and fewer dissents from, the opinions of such a court. Although
I have not done a statistical analysis, my impression from
reading the cases is that these expectations are accurate.

         Justice Souter's decisions on federal issues in criminal
 cases were potentially reviewable by the United states Supreme
 Court on direct review and by the lower federal courts and again
 by the United States Supreme Court on habeas corpus review.
 Independent of any actual review, of course, Justice Souter was
 bound by oath to apply applicable federal case law, an obligation
 that he took seriously. I can cite no case from my list in which
Justice Souter "cheated" in reading the precedent. This obliga-
tion, however, especially when combined with Justice Souter's
honesty in applying precedent and his reluctance to offer ex-
                                   926

traneous remarks, makes it difficult to predict with confidence
how Justice Souter would decide cases were he free to define the
applicable law. Nevertheless, some insights are possible.

         Justice Souter is a "conservative" judge in the criminal
justice area in the sense that he does not reverse criminal
convictions lightly. While he treats precedent fairly, he does
not indulge the facile presumption that controversial precedents,
particularly those that departed from historical understandings
in imposing limits on law enforcement, should be extended even
further. Rather, he places the burden of persuasion where it
belongs -- on those who seek such extensions. Moreover, Justice
Souter seems to believe that cogent arguments must precede use of
the state constitution to impose restrictions on the prosecution
that are not reguired by federal law. That is, he does not
regard the so-called "new federalism" as a justification, by
itself, for making law enforcement more difficult. When he finds
error, Justice Souter is not willing to reverse convictions to
achieve a speculative deterrent effect or merely to make a point.
Rather, if the error is truly "harmless," -- and again, he is
honest in evaluating this -- he will affirm the conviction. One
may surmise, therefore, even though his opinions do not contain
philosophical excursions, that Justice Souter firmly believes
that the interest in ascertaining truth in criminal cases should
be sacrificed only for compelling reasons. In this regard, he is
considerably different from the justice whom he has been nomi-
nated to replace.
                                      927

         From what already has been said, it should come as no
surprise that Justice Souter's criminal justice opinions disclose
no agenda, other than one to apply the governing law honestly and
with common sense. For those who seek a bold judge willing to
undo past "mistakes," there may be cause to anticipate some dis-
appointment. One can foresee, for example, Justice Souter
failing to supply the necessary vote to overrule a questionable
precedent because the case at bar can be decided on a narrower
ground. To cite one instance that perhaps supports this assess-
ment, Justice Souter was offered an opportunity to overrule a
1978 state court decision that requires the prosecution to prove
the validity of Miranda waivers beyond a reasonable doubt -- a
standard subsequently rejected as too high for federal constitu-
tional purposes by the United States Supreme Court. Justice
Souter declined the opportunity because the issue was not, in his
view, properly before the court and because the state, in any
event, satisfied the heavier burden. While some may see in this
cause for concern, such caution, restraint, and commitment to
procedural propriety may be what the country most needs given the
politicized atmosphere that recently has surrounded both the

            One is reminded of Justice White objecting in Illinois v.
Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), to the overruling of Spinelli v.
United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969), because, in his view, the
case could have been decided favorably to the state under Spin-
elli.

        2 State v. Derby, 561 A.2d 504 (1989). In State v. Rath-
bun, 561 A.2d 505 (1989), however, Justice Souter refused to
extend the earlier case to other Miranda issues.

judicial confirmation process in the Senate and the public
evaluation of Supreme Court opinions.

         From the cases I reviewed, I can find no legitimate basis
for either side of the political spectrum opposing this intel-
ligent jurist. Of course, for those who want politics rather
than law from the Supreme Court, Justice Souter is not the right
person. For those who know better, it should be evident that
President Bush has made an excellent selection.

II. Review of Particular Cases

         I have not attempted to discuss all, or even most, of
Justice Souter's criminal justice opinions. What follows is an
analysis of some cases in areas that might provoke particular
interest. The discussion, though limited, should prove adequate
to reveal the kind of jurist that Justice Souter is.

        A. Police Interrogation Issues

         Justice Souter wrote two opinions reversing convictions on
the basis of issues that pertain to the use of confessions. One
involved a challenge to police interrogation. The other, al-
though not turning upon an issue of police interrogation as such,
is discussed here because the defendant's response to the police
during interrogation gave rise to the issue before the court.
                                     929

Justice Souter also wrote several opinions affirming convictions
in cases that raised police interrogation issues.

         In State v. Lamb, Justice Souter concluded that the trial
judge failed to find, as required by a 1978 state case, that the
validity of the defendant's Miranda waiver had been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt. Because Lamb was decided before the United
States Supreme Court applied the lower preponderance of the
evidence standard to Miranda waivers, it provided no occasion to
review the earlier state court holding. (As discussed above,
Justice Souter for procedural reasons declined a subsequent
opportunity to review the 1978 decision.) Justice Souter's
analysis of the record and treatment of precedent was honest and
appropriate. While the reversal arguably turned on a "techni-
cality," the technicality was not one of Justice Souter's making.

         In State v. Jones, the second reversal, Justice Souter
actually concluded that Miranda had not been violated. Correctly
anticipating a later Supreme Court case, he first ruled that
Miranda does not require the police to tell the suspect the crime
he is suspected of having committed. He next ruled, again
correctly, that the defendant's refusal to sign the statement he
gave the police did not invalidate his previous waiver. Never-

         5 484 A.2d 1070 (1984).
         6 Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564 (1987), a 7-2 decision
in which only Justices Brennan and Marshall dissented.

                                      930

theless, Justice Souter deemed it necessary to reverse the
defendant's conviction for attempted murder because the trial
judge had answered "no" to the jury's question of whether the
defendant's refusal to sign the statement meant that he complete-
ly denied its truth. Noting that lawyers would assume that the
judge's answer meant only that the refusal was subject to more
than one interpretation, Justice Souter nevertheless concluded
that a lay jury probably would have taken the judge's unequivocal
answer as a resolution of the factual issue. Because the issue
of fact was for the jury, a reversal was necessary. Demonstrat-
ing both fairness to defendants and judicial integrity, Justice
Souter properly concluded that this kind of error could not be
deemed "harmless."

         In State v. Lewis, on the other hand, the facts presented a
close issue as to whether the police had misled the defendant
when they responded to his question about the meaning of waiver.
Observing that the court would have agreed with the defendant if
it had limited its review to the portion of the record he iso-
lated, Justice Souter concluded that the entire record supported
the trial judge's findings that the police did not mislead the
defendant and that the defendant had a correct understanding of
what it meant to waive his rights. Justice Souter observed, as

should stand unless they are contrary to the manifest weight of

the evidence. After dismissing other Miranda arguments that
posed less difficulty, Justice Souter also rejected the defen-
dant's claim that it was fundamentally unfair for the police to
wire his acquaintance and use him as an informant. Referring to
the defendant's argument as "obscure," Justice Souter remarked
that fundamental unfairness for due process purposes does not
occur "simply because a defendant places himself at a disad-
vantage under circumstances in which there are no substantive
constitutional violations."

                                           q
         State v. Bruneau perhaps is one of the better cases for
revealing Justice Souter's reluctance to reverse criminal convic-
tions on the basis of strained constitutional arguments. The
defendant, who previously had confessed to his friend about
murdering his wife, continued to contact his friend by phone
after he had been formally charged with the murder. When the
friend informed the police of this, they neither encouraged nor
discouraged him to take the long distance calls. The friend took
the calls and later informed the police of the defendant's
incriminating remarks and threats to witnesses. The defendant
argued that this violated his right to counsel under both the
state and national constitutions. Rejecting both claims, Justice
Souter held, first, that the friend was not acting as an agent of
the state at the time of the calls, his private "hopes" of

benefit not being equivalent to police inducement, and the police
"readiness to receive11 information not being equivalent to
"importunity to obtain" information. Second, Justice Souter held
that the friend did not interrogate or deliberately elicit
incriminating remarks from the defendant. With regard to another
statement admittedly taken in violation of Miranda. Justice
Souter held, in accordance with United States Supreme Court
precedent, that the statement could have been used, as the trial
judge had ruled, for impeachment purposes. Because the defendant
failed to make the argument in the trial court, and because, in
any event, the defendant had not opened himself to impeachment by
actually taking the stand, Justice Souter declined to consider
whether a different impeachment rule should govern statements
obtained in violation of either the sixth amendment or the state
constitution's right to counsel provision rather than in viola-
tion of Miranda·

         pruneau came on the heels of (1) a 1983 decision, in which
Justice Souter did not participate, that suggested, without
holding, that the state constitution's right to counsel provision
might give broader protection to defendants than the sixth
amendment and (2) a 1984 opinion in which Justice Souter noted
in passing that state precedent interpreting the state constitu-
tion required the prosecutor to prove an explicit waiver of the

        10 State v. Tapply, 470 A.2d 900 (1983) (reversing defen-

dant's conviction; Justice Souter not sitting)
                                      933

right to counsel.11 The dictum in these cases notwithstanding,
Justice Souter declined in Bruneau to use the defendant's invoca-
tion of the state constitution as an excuse to impose further and
questionable restraints on the use of a defendant's reliable
admissions at trial.

         B. Fifth Amendment Issues Not Related to Police Interroga-
tion

         Contrary to popular belief, the fifth amendment prohibits
not self-incrimination but only "compelled" self-incrimination,
and then only self-incrimination of a testimonial or communica-
tive nature. A defendant has no constitutional protection from
being compelled to produce physical evidence, such as a hand-
writing sample or fingerprints, no matter how incriminating such
evidence may be. With their roots in the same common law
background, self-incrimination clauses in state constitutions
presumably are no broader. At the very least, the burden should
be on those who would contend otherwise.

         1 1 State v. Elbert, 480 A.2d 854 (1984) (finding no viola-
tion of the fifth or sixth amendments because the defendant
initiated conversations about the crime with the police even
though he earlier had invoked the right to counsel).

         Justice Souter's opinions evidence a keen appreciation that
the protection against compulsory self-incrimination was not
intended to protect the defendant from doing anything that harms
his chances of acquittal. State v. Cormier perhaps is his best
reasoned opinion in this area. In Cormier. Justice Souter's
opinion followed South Dakota v. Neville. which had interpreted
the fifth amendment, and held that the state's use of the defen-
dant's refusal to take a chemical test for blood alcohol content
did not violate the self-incrimination clause in the state
constitution. Justice Souter concluded both that the refusal to
take the test was not evidence of a "testimonial" nature and that
the state did not "compel" the refusal. He reasoned that under
governing case law, the legislature simply could have compelled
the chemical test, because such a test produces evidence that is
physical in nature. What the legislature did here was to give
motorists a choice to refuse to take the test -- a choice it did
not have to give -- but to impose a cost on the exercise of this
choice. Without this cost, the legislature would have emascu-
lated its testing law. Surprisingly, two justices declined to
follow Neville and Justice Souter's reasoning.

         1 6 See also State v. Frederick, 566 A.2d 180 (1989) (again
following Neville). In State v. Denney, 536 A.2d 1242 (1987),
Justice Souter dissented from a holding, based on the state
constitution's due process clause, that the defendant's refusal
to take the test cannot be used as evidence if the police fail to
advise the defendant that his refusal can be used against him.
Justice Souter argued, first, that Miranda warnings provided the

                                                       11
                                    935

         In other opinions, Justice Souter held that neither the
national nor the state constitution protects against compulsory
disclosures in civil commitment proceedings. He also held that
a prosecutor·s comment at trial about the defendant·s trying to
pull the wool over the eyes of the police and the jury was not a
comment on the defendant's failure to testify. Two other cases
raised comment on silence issues. Affirming an attempted murder
conviction, Justice Souter concluded that the prosecutor could
ask the victim at trial whether the defendant apologized after
the shooting, which the defendant claimed was accidental; Justice
Souter reasoned that because neither the national nor the state
constitution gives self-incrimination protection against private
parties, such as the victim, the defendant could not invoke the
rule that bars evidentiary use of post-arrest silence following

defendant all the advice that was necessary. More fundamentally,
Justice Souter disagreed that any warning pertaining to the
evidentiary consequences of refusing to take the test was re-
quired. He charged the majority with transforming "the familiar
and specific requirement of [Miranda] into a general rule of
evidence, unlimited by any reference to the constitutional
privilege that Miranda was intended to serve." Id. at 1247
Souter, J. dissenting). He also faulted the majority for failing
to distinguish fundamental unfairness "from what the defendant
finds unfortunate." Id. at 1249. In terms of statutory and
constitutional construction and the treatment of precedent, the
dissent reveals Justice Souter at his analytic best.

California, 380 U.S. 609 (1967), prohibits comment on the defen-
dant's failure to testify.

                                     936

Miranda warnings. In a related ruling, Justice Souter con-
cluded that the prosecutor's evidentiary use at trial of the
defendant's boast to the police that he was too sophisticated to
confess constituted proper use of a statement rather than imper-
missible use of the defendant's invocation of his right to
silence.20 None of these holdings should be deemed controver-
sial.

         C. Search and Seizure

        Because of the exclusionary rule, perhaps no one area of
criminal procedure produces more litigation, and more hair-
splitting, than search and seizure. Though sensitive to con-
stitutional protection, Justice Souter demonstrated a disinclin-
ation to engage in the kind of technical Monday morning quarter-
backing that too often has brought the criminal justice system
into disrepute.

        Most searches and arrests require probable cause. Although
the United States Supreme Court has cautioned that probable cause
is a practical, nontechnical concept that requires an exercise of
common sense, some appellate judges approach the issue as legal

         1 9 State v. Brown>\517 A.2d 831 (1986). The defendant had
invoked the rule of Doyle^v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).

United States, 338 U.S. 160 (1949).

technicians, giving no deference either to the often hurried
judgments the police must make or to the evaluations of magis-
trates who issue warrants. Not Justice Souter.

         In State v. Davis. for example, Justice Souter upheld a
warrant issued on the basis of a tip from an informant who had
agreed to provide information to the police in return for favor-
able treatment with regard to his own criminal charge. Following
Illinois v. Gates. Justice Souter applied a totality of cir-
cumstances test to the issue of probable cause. He concluded
that "participation in plea bargaining imposes no automatic
disqualification of an informer." Looking at the police corrob-
oration of the tip, Justice Souter reasoned that no special
insight was needed to understand that the defendant was planning
to sell drugs.

         In State v. Baldic.24 Justice Souter upheld a finding of
probable cause based upon a robbery victim's not too detailed
description. "On otherwise deserted streets, and within minutes
of a late evening robbery in a small town, the officer saw an
individual who matched the victim's description of the perpetra-
tor as a male with bushy hair, and who was wearing a jacket that
appeared to be consistent with the victim's description."25

                                   938

Justice Souter also found significant the defendant's failure to
respond to the officer's spotlight. While the defendant, of
course, could have been innocent of the robbery, Justice Souter's
opinion implicitly recognized both that police often must act on
the basis of the evidence they have -- not on what we might wish
that they had -- and that police failure to act promptly after a
crime often will mean that the crime goes unsolved. Justice
Souter's opinion evinces an understanding that probable cause
requires the common sense judgments of reasonably cautious police
officers."26

         State v. Faragi27 provided an interesting twist on the
probable cause issue. The defendant appealed a first degree
murder conviction alleging, among other things, that his counsel
was ineffective for failing to attempt to suppress the murder
weapon on grounds of an allegedly illegal search of his home.
Justice Souter concluded that the defendant could not possibly
have been prejudiced by the lawyer's decision because the warrant
that authorized the search was valid. Relying on a lower federal
court opinion, the defendant argued that it was not reasonable
to assume that he kept the murder weapon in his home. Justice
Souter opted for a "different generalization": "where the object

              For similar holdings by Justice Souter, see State v.
Chaloux, 546 A.2d 1081 (1988); State v. Maya, 493 A.2d 1139
(1985) (finding reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop after a
store burglary).

of the search is a weapon used in the crime . . . the inference
that the item is at the offender's residence is especially
compelling." Once again evidencing his appreciation of prob-
able cause as a practical concept, Justice Souter concluded that
the warrant application unquestionably established probable
cause.

         State v. Valenzuela.30 a 3-1 decision, must rank as one the
better, and most important, search and seizure opinions written
by Justice Souter. The defendants challenged the use of pen
registers by the state police that had been installed pursuant to
federal court order. (A pen register records the numbers dialed
from a phone but does not intercept conversations.) Although the
United States Supreme Court in Smith v. Maryland had held that
the use of pen registers was not a "search" for fourth amendment
purposes, the defendants claimed that the use of these devices
was a search under the state constitution, and an illegal search
in this instance because probable cause was lacking. Justice
Souter's opinion declined to interpret the state constitution
more broadly than the United States Supreme Court had interpreted
the fourth amendment.

         Justice Souter began by observing that both parties ironi-
cally had assumed that the reasonable expectation of privacy test

from Katz v. United States3 2 defined the scope of the state
constitution's search and seizure provision. He suggested at
least the possibility that the state constitution was intended to
have a narrower scope than that defined by Katz. Nevertheless,
proceeding on the assumption that the Katz privacy test con-
trolled for state constitutional purposes, Justice Souter agreed
with the analysis in Smith that pen registers do not fall within
the scope of this test. Justice Souter carefully reviewed,
argument by argument, the criticisms leveled at the Smith opin-
ion, and he found each criticism lacking in merit. Demonstrating
his legal acumen, he refused to rely on the weaker segments of
the Smith opinion -- those dealing with subjective privacy
expectations and "assumption of the risk." Nevertheless, he
reasoned that to reject the Smith analysis in toto would be to
cast doubt on a substantial body of search and seizure jurispru-
dence. The following is just one segment of a lengthy and
thorough analysis:

        The defendants' position would redefine Katz's privacy
        by converting it from a defendant's right to be secure
        against certain means of non-consensual access to his
        communications and possessions, into a defendant's
        right to control the use of evidence without regard to
        how the defendant may have disclosed that evidence to

        3 2 389 U.S. 347 (1967):
                                                       17
                                   941

         another. It would empower the defendant to enforce a
         kind of evidentiary copyright, by precluding the gov-
         ernment's use of information for a purpose that the
         defendant did not intend when he communicated with
         another. Suffice it to say that we could not accept
         the defendants' position without a wholesale overruling
         of the agent-informer cases . . . which stand together

                                                                                                 33
         as an integral limit to Katz's concept of privacy.

        A few other search and seizure decisions warrant passing
comment. In State v. Stiles. Justice Souter rejected an argu-
ment that a search warrant was tainted by illegal tape recording
under a state statute; Justice Souter correctly observed that the
agent's own recollection, not the tape recording, was the source
of information for the warrant. Those more eager to apply ex-
clusionary rules may not have perceived this distinction. In
State v. Cimino.35 Justice Souter rejected a similar "fruit of
the poisonous tree" argument, concluding that even if the seizure
of pills from a car was illegal, the pills played no role in the

       * 3 3 536 A.2d at 1261. Justice Souter also disposed of
several other search and seizure issues. Deserving special
commendation is his analysis showing that the defendants had
confused stale probable cause and stale information that is used
to establish current probable cause: "If such past fact contri-
butes to an inference that probable cause exists at the time of
the application, its age is no taint."

probable cause that subsequently developed. In State v. Cote.
Justice Souter rejected a hair-splitting argument that a search
warrant for the defendant's restaurant did not permit a search of
the restaurant's basement. In State v. Cannata.37 he upheld a
conviction by applying harmless error analysis to the search and

                                                                             38
seizure claim. Finally, in State v. Koppel. Justice Souter
dissented from an opinion that invalidated sobriety checkpoint
stops as unreasonable searches and seizures under the state «^, "
constitution. Just this year, Justice Souter's position on this
issue was adopted for fourth amendment purposes by the United

                                     39
States Supreme Court.

         D. Admissibility of Eyewitness Identification Testimony

         For some kinds of crimes, such as robbery and rape, eyewit-
ness identification testimony can be crucial. The admission of
such testimony was viewed entirely as a matter of state eviden-
tiary law until the late 1960's, when the Supreme Court created
new exclusionary rules stemming from its application of the sixth
amendment right to counsel and the due process clause to pretrial
police identification procedures.

                                    943

         In State v. Humphrey.40 Justice Souter rejected a due pro-
cess challenge to a pretrial photo display. Carefully examining
the record, he demonstrated that the display was not unneces-
sarily suggestive. In State v. Prisby. Justice Souter refused
to consider such a challenge because the defendant had failed to
make a timely objection. Perhaps most significantly, however,
Justice Souter in State v. Cross rejected an argument that
eyewitness identification evidence should be suppressed, even
absent police misconduct, simply because of the danger of un-
reliability. The federal constitutional exclusionary rules are
based on the view that the state has no legitimate interest in
contributing to the risk of mistake, as it might do, for example,
by conducting an unnecessarily suggestive lineup. While the risk
of mistake is inherent in human perception and recall, the addi-
tional risk created by unnecessarily suggestive identification
procedures is gratuitous. When the police have not engaged in
such misconduct, however, the rule is, as it always has been,
that the weight, if any, that should be given to a witness's
identification is for the jury or trier of fact to decide.
Justice Souter in Cross adhered to the common law rule by refus-
ing to create yet another, and even more novel, exclusionary rule

that would make judges, rather than juries, the ones to evaluate
witness credibility.

         E. Guilty Pleas and Trial by Jury

         In Richard v. MacAski11. Justice Souter reversed a lower
court order dismissing the defendant's habeas corpus challenge to
a nolo contendere plea to shoplifting. The defendant alleged
that his plea taking procedure did not comply with the procedural
requirements of Bovkin v. Alabama.44 Justice Souter concluded
that although a technical Boykin violation requires reversal on
direct appeal, the defendant cannot prevail on collateral attack
(i.e., habeas corpus) unless his plea was unknowingly or involun-
tarily made. If the defendant has shown a Boykin violation,
however, the state has the burden of demonstrating the plea's
validity. On the facts presented, Justice Souter concluded both
that Boykin had been violated, in that the record did not show
the defendant was aware of the rights she was relinquishing, and
that the state failed to carry its burden of showing that the
defendant understood she had the right to go to trial. Justice
Souter remanded the case to give the state an opportunity to
carry its burden.

                                    945

         Richard is not wholly satisfactory in that it is difficult
to believe that the defendant was not aware of what rights she
was relinquishing when she entered her plea. Moreover, much can
be said for a rule that presumes defense counsel has communicated
with the client. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court
has mandated procedures that will make evident on the record that
the defendant explicitly waived his rights and entered a knowing
plea, and there is no disputing that such a record did not exist
in this case. Indeed, Justice Souter criticized the trial court
because this was the second case in recent years to reveal that
the court had made "neither a taped nor a written record." The
clear message is that whatever one may think of Boykin. these
errors are easy to avoid.

         In State v. Hewitt.45 Justice Souter similarly applied a
rigorous standard to the issue of waiver of trial by jury.
During the defendant's trial for forgery, the trial judge decided
both to dismiss one of the jurors who might have known the defen-
dant and to continue the trial with eleven jurors, no alternative
jurors having been selected. The judge announced his decision to
counsel in chambers and again in open court. On the latter
occasion, defense counsel, in front of the defendant, responded,
"That's fine." With new counsel on appeal, the defendant claimed
that the waiver was invalid because the trial judge did not

follow a "Boykin" procedure to determine that he, the defendant,
personally wanted to waive this right.

         Relying on the state constitution's jury trial provision,
Justice Souter agreed and reversed the conviction. Starting from
the premise that "the right to trial by jury is one of central
and fundamental importance," Justice Souter concluded that ac-
quiescence in the loss of fundamental rights will not be presum-
ed. Recognizing that a number of federal decisions had permitted
the waiver of constitutional rights to be implied, Justice Souter
found those decisions inapposite: first, the right at issue here
was fundamental; second, the court knew that the right in ques-
tion was being waived; third, the trial judge could have engaged
in a waiver inquiry without requiring the defense to reveal
strategic or confidential information. Justice Souter found the
right at issue no less important because only one juror was
dismissed: "twelve means twelve, and concessions can develop
momentum."

        Among Justice Souter's opinions, Hewitt stands virtually
alone in revealing a willingness to reverse a conviction for an
arguably technical reason when there was a choice. As Justice
Souter conceded, some federal cases specifically have held that
defense counsel's stipulation to a jury of less than twelve is
enough to bind the client. Moreover, the likelihood in this case
that the defendant would have disagreed seems insubstantial. In

addition, Justice Souter's "slippery slope" concern about allow-
ing any concessions is not fully persuasive. On the other hand,
the right to trial by jury is fundamental in an historical sense,
waiver of this right not even being permitted at common law and
in the early days of this republic. If there are any rights the
defendant personally must waive, trial by jury seems an obvious
candidate for inclusion. Finally, as in MacAskill. the trial
judge easily can avoid posttrial disagreements over waiver simply
by asking the defendant whether he knows what he is relinquishing
and wants to proceed. The Hewitt holding, that is, imposes no
real burden on the criminal justice system.

         State v. O'Learv.48 which involved both guilty plea and
trial by jury issues, demonstrates Justice Souter's unwilling-
ness, even in these two areas, lightly to overturn reliable
convictions. Writing for the Court, Justice Souter first held
that due process under the state constitution does not prevent
the prosecution from rescinding a plea agreement before the
defendant has pleaded or otherwise relied upon the agreement.49
Second, Justice Souter held that the trial judge did not violate
the defendant's right to trial by jury when he told the jury that
they need not be concerned with proof of penetration because the

              See also State v. Bailey, 503 A.2d 762 (1985) (due
process requires a record to be made of the judge's conferences
with jurors; on these facts, failure to make a record was harm-
less error).

defendant had admitted this element of the crime in his testi-
mony. Sounding a cautionary note, however, Justice Souter added
that "[t]here is a quantum difference of constitutional signifi-
cance between a fact admitted under the conditions present here
and a fact merely uncontested." Justice Souter also warned that
judges should not assume that the defendant has made an admission
if there is any doubt about the matter. Though concurring on
harmless error grounds, two justices disagreed with Justice
Souter's view that the trial judge did not violate the defen-
dant's right to trial by jury.

         F. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

         Ineffective assistance of trial counsel quite understandably
is a favorite allegation for disappointed defendants seeking to
overturn their convictions either on direct appeal or collateral
attack. If not approached realistically, such allegations can
play havoc with the strong interest in finality in criminal
prosecutions. An appellate judge aware of his or her limited
role in this area knows that Monday morning quarterbacking is to
be avoided. Legal assistance is ineffective not when the judge
disagrees with strategic defense choices but only when those
choices, one, are outside the bounds of reasonable disagreement

              See also State v. Elliot, 574 A.2d 1378 (1990) (plea is
not unknowing because defendant not told conviction would make
him liable to be declared a motor vehicle habitual offender).

                                                       25
                                     949

and, two, prejudice the defendant. Justice Souter's opinions in
this area reflect a proper awareness of the appellate court's
role.

        Justice Souter's opinion in State v. Faraai already has been
discussed.51 Justice Souter used a similar analytic approach in
State v. Alleqra. affirming the defendant's forgery conviction
but remanding for reconsideration of the sentence. The defendant
alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because of counsel's
failure to file a motion to quash the indictment on the ground
that it charged a misdemeanor, not a felony as it claimed.
Agreeing that the indictment incorrectly described the defen-
dant's offense as a felony, Justice Souter disagreed that counsel
was ineffective for failing to file a motion to quash. He
pointed out that the indictment validly charged the misdemeanor
offense, and that felony courts could assume jurisdiction over
misdemeanors and probably would have done so in this case. Hence
counsel's decision was not the product of professional incom-
petence. Moreover, because the defendant's sentence did not
exceed what a misdemeanor conviction would have authorized,
Justice Souter also concluded that the prejudice prong of the
 ineffective assistance of counsel test was not satisfied.

         That Justice Souter approached ineffective assistance of
 counsel claims with common sense does not mean that he was cava-

         51

                                    950

lier in rejecting such claims. In the same Alleara case, he
agreed that reconsideration of the sentence was necessary because
the sentence imposed, though within what the misdemeanor statute
authorized, may have been influenced by the judge's belief, not
corrected by counsel, that the crime was a felony. Although this
conclusion did not justify reversal of the sentence under the
prejudice prong of the test, Justice Souter, demonstrating his
fairness, used the court's supervisory power over the trial
courts to order a reconsideration of the sentence. Showing his
disinclination for wasting scarce judicial resources, however,
Justice Souter observed that the trial judge simply could let the
original sentence stand if in fact he had been aware that the
offense was only a misdemeanor.

         Justice Souter also found in Alleara that counsel was incom-
petent for failing to object to certain jury instructions. He
avoided reversing the conviction outright only by concluding that
the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test
was not satisfied: the defendant failed to demonstrate a prob-
ability that the verdict would have been different.53 Indeed, he
thought it highly unlikely that the outcome would have been
different. Justice Souter reached this conclusion only after
carefully reviewing and analyzing the record. Finally, finding,
as in Faragi, that the search warrant at issue was valid, Justice

              The prejudice prong was imposed in Strickland v. Wash-
ington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).

                                                       27
                                     951

Souter absolved defense counsel of an additional charge of incom-
petence for not filing a motion to suppress.

        Allegra reveals a judge without a "knee-jerk" response to
issues that come before him. Although the temptation is great to
become cynical about ineffective assistance claims, Justice
Souter proceeded to consider and to address seriously each of the
defendant's arguments in Alleara with regard to this issue. He
found some of the arguments wholly lacking in merit, some only
partially lacking in merit, and one -- that regarding the sen-
tencing -- deserving of some appellate relief. Demonstrating
fairness and care, he also eschewed precipitous and reckless use
of the "reversal" club that an appellate court carries. More
could not be asked of an appellate judge.

         G. Rape Shield Law

         Loose talk has suggested that the only conviction Justice
Souter ever reversed involved the state's rape shield statute.
Presumably such hyperbole is supposed to convey a sense of a pro-
prosecution judge who is not sensitive to the interests of women.
If this is the intended message, it is wrong on both counts.
Justice Souter's willingness to reverse convictions when neces-

              See also Hopps v. State Bd. of Parole, 500 A.2d 355
(1985) (rejecting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim
predicated on an alleged conflict of interest).

                                     952

sary already has been demonstrated. Attention here will focus on
his decisions applying the rape shield statute.

         New Hampshire's rape shield statute bars evidence of "prior
sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the
defendant."55 In State v. Colbath.56 the defendant was charged
with felonious sexual assault. Having met the complainant at a
bar and associated with her there during the afternoon, the
defendant took her to his trailer, where sexual intercourse
occurred. According to the complainant, the intercourse was
forcible; according to the defendant, it was consensual. The
defendant claimed that the complainant directed sexually provoca-
tive attention not only to him but also to several other men in
the bar on the afternoon in guestion, and there was substantial
evidence of this. The trial judge first permitted the defense to
produce testimony to this effect, then ruled that such evidence
was inadmissible, and then acquiesced nevertheless in the intro-
duction of such evidence. In his instructions, however, the
judge explicitly told the jury that the complainant's activities
with other men on the day in question was not to be considered on
the issue of consent. He relied, at least in part, on the rape
shield law.

        Justice Souter observed that the instruction could be upheld
only if the evidence was excludable. Despite the apparently

                                                               29
                                     953

absolute terms of the statute, earlier cases had held that the
statute had to be construed so as not to violate the defendant's
constitutional right to confrontation. In particular, State v.
Howard.57 decided before Justice Souter joined the court, had
held that a defendant must be given an opportunity to show that
the probative value of such evidence "in the context of [the]
particular case outweighs its prejudicial effect on the prosecu-
trix." Justice Souter concluded that this was such a case.

         First, the evidence at issue referred to public acts at the
bar, not to private acts of an intimate nature: "evidence of
public displays of general interest in sexual activity can be
taken to indicate a contemporaneous receptiveness to sexual
advances that cannot be inferred from evidence of private be-
havior with chosen sex partners." Second, the evidence was
particularly strong given that the acts in question occurred
closely in time to the alleged assault. Third, in this case, a
motive to lie was presented in that the defendant's living com-
panion had caught the defendant and the complainant in his
trailer and violently assaulted the latter. "With the sex act
thus admitted, with the evidence of violence subject to excul-
patory explanation, and with a motive for the complainant to make
a false accusation, the outcome of the prosecution could well
have turned on a very close judgment about the complainant's
attitude of resistance or consent." Furthermore, because the

                                                       30
                                     954

privacy interest underlying the statute was virtually absent
here, there was little to outweigh the defendant's need for the
evidence. Given that no one has a legitimate interest in
mistaken convictions, it should come as no surprise on facts such
as these that no justice dissented.

         In State v. Baker. decided before Colbath. Justice Souter
showed that application of the principles employed in that case
has nothing whatsoever to do with the gender of the complainant.
The defendant was convicted of felonious sexual assault of a
thirteen year old boy. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice
Souter reversed the conviction because the trial court had failed
to provide the defendant the hearing required by Howard on the
possible admissibility of sexual conduct evidence.

         In State v. Goulet. a case involving a female complainant,
the prosecutor commented on the defendant's failure to show that
the victim was sexually promiscuous. The trial judge overruled
defense counsel's objection on the ground that such evidence
could have been admissible despite the rape shield statute.
Justice Souter concluded that the term "promiscuity" was broad
enough to cover conduct not admissible under the Howard rule. He
added, moreover, that Howard did not provide an automatic rule of
admissibility; rather, the complainant's claim of personal priv-

        5 9 508 A.2d 1059 (1986).
        6 0 529 A.2d 879 (1987).

                                     955

acy cannot be defeated unless the defendant offers facts demon-
strating that probative value outweighs prejudice. Justice
Souter construed the Howard rule fairly and narrowly, thus demon-
strating his sensitivity to the privacy interests of female
complainants. In addition, by concluding that the defense had
invited the prosecutor's comment, he also affirmed the defen-
dant's conviction for a brutal sexual assault.

        H. Miscellaneous

        As previously indicated, Justice Souter wrote too many
criminal justice opinions to review even most of them. This is
somewhat unfortunate, because numerous cases outside the areas
already discussed confirm both his intellectual honesty and his
intelligence. A few worth reading are mentioned here.

         In State v. Springer. Justice Souter rejected a construc-
tion of the state's restitution statute that would have permitted
restitution to be ordered to the victim's insurance carrier.
Justice Souter carefully reviewed the text of the statute and its
legislative history in reaching this conclusion. To the state's
argument that such an interpretation would produce an absurd

        6 1 See also State v. Johnson, 564 A.2d 444 (1989), not
involving the rape shield statute, but holding that the judge
erred in sequestering the fourteen year old male.complainant and,
therefore, did not err in permitting him to testify in rebuttal.

        6 2 574 A.2d 1381 (1990).
                                                       32
                                     956

result, Justice Souter responded that such an argument should be
redirected to the legislature. "[W]hen the intent is consistent
with the language employed, this court has no interpretive right
to disregard it in disparagement of the legislative choice it
reflects." Obviously, this is a judge inclined to interpret
rather than legislate the law.

         In State v. Dufield. Justice Souter rejected an argument
that voluntary intoxication could be a defense to second degree
murder based upon reckless indifference to human life. His
reasoned opinion demonstrates keen ability to grapple with some
of the difficult jurisprudential issues on the substantive side
of the criminal law. In State v. Allen.64 Justice Souter simi-
larly wrote an insightful opinion explaining why an indictment
for attempted murder need not allege the degree of the murder
attempted. Particularly revealing of his judicial outlook was
this comment: "We are dealing, after all, with a code of basic
human conduct, not with a system of esoteric rules designed to
guide specialist professionals." Were it only true that all
judges shared this view.

         Finally, numerous decisions show appropriate deference to
the findings of the trial judge. Among these are State v. Hart-

        6 3 549 A.2d 1205 (1988).
        6 4 514 A.2d 1263 (1986).

ford,66 upholding a hung jury mistrial challenged on double
jeopardy grounds; State v. Cochran. upholding a judge's eviden-
tiary decision that probative value outweighed possible prejudi-
cial effect; and State v. Knowles.68 deferring to the trial
judge's decision to invoke the catch-all exception to the hearsay
rule.

III. Conclusion

        The above review of Justice Souter's opinions should confirm
the assessment of him set forth in the overview section of this
analysis, and little would be served by repeating that assessment
here. Suffice it to say that in a day when legal issues tend to
be examined from the perspective of competing "sides," Justice
Souter's opinions reflect that he is neither a "pro-prosecution"
nor a "pro-defense" judge. Rather he is a fair and intelligent
jurist who, while not inclined to indulge frivolous arguments for
reversal, treats serious issues with the seriousness they de-
serve. He is a judge who believes in "neutral principles, "mean-
ing that his decisions are dependent upon the issues in the
particular case rather than upon the identity of the parties
before the court. Thus, in one case, an application of the rape

        6 7 569 A.2d 756 (1990).

                                                               34
                                      958

shield statute may favor the defendant, in another it may favor
the male or female complainant; in one case, an examination of
guilty plea requirements may favor the prosecutor, in another it
may favor the defendant. Always, however, Justice Souter is wary
of reversing convictions for insubstantial reasons. That some
may view such a "conservative" approach to reversing convictions
as proof of a bias for the prosecution reflects more on the times
we live in, and on those who would make such a charge, than it
does on Justice Souter's impartiality and legal ability.

Dear Committee Members:

Judge David H. Souter is remadebly well-suited for confirmation to the
United States Supreme Court. During his years as a New Hampshire
Supreme Court judge he always demonstrated a profound reverence for
our venerable State and Federal constitutions. His judicial decisions
were never driven by any personal social or political philosophy.

As a former member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives when
Judge Souter was a sitting New Hampshire Supreme Court judge and a
continuous member of the New Hampshire Bar since 1978, I can attest
to the immense respect he has for each branch of government. He did
not, and will not, allow one branch to encroach upon the responsibilites
and powers of the others.

In my capacity as a law professor (University of Lowell, Lowell, Ma.),
I have had an opportunity to review and analyze a number of his New
Hampshire Supreme Court decisions, and Advisory Opinions directed to
specific legislatively crafted constitutional inquiries. His writings
reveal a scholarly, competent and objective judge who communicates
with clarity, logical consistency and an emerging literary flair.
Judge Souter has never forced a judicial opinion based on some pre-
ordained or intended result. His decision making process seeks to
correctly balance competing constitutional principles and interests.
For example, his dissenting view in State v. Koppel (127 N.H.286)
shows a judge strongly aware of an extremely serious public problem
 (drunk driving) and even willing to break ranks with the majority by
allowing non-overly intrusive roadblocks to protect the public
interest in safe highways. He would have decided Koppel based on a
Fourth Amendment U.S. Supreme Court case (Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S.
648). One might reasonably conclude from Koppel that his deep respect
for stare decisis ensures a commitment to impartiality.

Like so many lawyers from the Granite State, I have known Judge Souter
on a professional and personal level since my first days practicing
before him when he was a New Hampshire Superior Court judge and from
joining him at Bar Association meetings and other events. I have
found him to be sincere, friendly and courteous. He is recognized
as a judge who has always been very fair to members of the Bar.

In my opinion, Judge Souter's professional accomplishments, judicial
temperment and intellect make him exceptionally well qualified to
serve as a distinguished member of the U.S. Supreme Court. I respect-
fully ask that you confirm his nomination.

                             STATEMENT OF JUDITH L. LICHTMAN,
                   PRESIDENT OF THE WOMEN'S LEGAL DEFENSE FUND,
               URGING THE SENATE JUDICIARY TO RECOMMEND AGAINST

                        THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE DAVID SOUTER
          AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                                                              September 18, 1990

         Three full days of hearings on the nomination of Judge David
Souter to the Supreme Court have now been completed. Last week,
as the hearings opened, we were seriously concerned that he does
not possess the bottom-line qualification for confirmation to the
Supreme Court: a meaningful committment to protecting the legal
rights of women. We had reviewed Judge Souter's record on
women's constitutional and legal rights and were not assured by
it that he subscribes to key constitutional and legal principles
that protect women against discrimination and guarantee their
fundamental rights to privacy and reproductive freedom.1

        We listened to Judge Souter's responses to the questions of
the Judiciary Committee with hope that they would answer our
questions and resolve our concerns. But we did not receive the
assurances that we had hoped for, and that Judge Souter could
have given. To the contrary, Judge Souter avoided answering the
very questions about women's rights that would have assured us of
his commitment; he did not even state the principles against
which he would test violations of women's rights. For this
reason, after having listened to and analyzed his responses as
well as his record, we reluctantly conclude that we must oppose
his confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice.

         Our bases for this conclusion are several. First, despite
extensive discussion of the law governing the constitutionality

           A copy of our report, "Judge David Souter's Record on
Women's Constitutional and Legal Rights: Cause for Serious
Concern" (September 10, 1990), is attached and submitted for the
record.
                                   963

of sex discrimination. Judge Souter never expressed his
commitment to the protections against sex discrimination that
current Supreme Court cases afford. Nor did he affirm his
support of the rights of women and of people of color to equal
employment opportunity by approving of current Supreme Court
precedent upholding affirmative action in certain circumstances.
Finally, and most important, Judge Souter refused to acknowledge
a fundamental right to privacy that protects women's rights to
procreative choice. In fact, he refused to give any indication
of how he would rule on restrictions on women's right to choose

                                                                     2
whether and when to bear children.

        Throughout the hearings, he was given opportunity after
opportunity to demonstrate his understanding of women's rights,
his commitment to the constitutional principles that protect
women's rights. He consistently failed to explain what those
principles might mean, in practice, to real women's lives. In
contrast, when discussing other areas of the law, he did, more
than once, express his opinions about legal principles and
explain their effect.

        By failing to affirm women's rights principles. Judge Souter
puts the country in an untenable position. He is asking the
American people to support his nomination to the Supreme Court
without assurances that he will protect our rights once on that
Court.

        2 These concerns are discussed in depth below.

              o

             For example. Judge Souter expressed both his personal
views on and his understanding of prevailing law in the area of
the first amendment's guarantees of freedom of religion -- an
area of the law no more settled than women's rights. He went on
to discuss the analysis that he would apply to cases alleging
infringement of these guarantees. Tr. at 42-48 (Sept. 14, 1990).
                                    964

        what's at stake is not some mere theoretical principle. The
freedoms and fundamental rights of all Americans are at stake.
The livelihoods, the health, and even the lives of millions of
American women are at stake. With so much hanging in the
balance, Americans need to know that those who are "to make the
provisions of the Constitution a reality for our times, and to
preserve that Constitution for the generations that will
follow"4 are also committed to protecting their legal rights.

         I. Judge Souter failed to articulate a firm commitment to
         eliminating invidious sex-based classifications under the
        Equal Protection Clause.

         For women, the only constitutional protection against laws
that discriminate against them on the basis of gender is found in
the supreme court's interpretations of the Equal Protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under these Fourteenth
Amendment cases, gender-based laws and regulations are
unconstitutional unless they meet the following test: that the
government can show that they are "substantially related to an
important government interest." This test is called "heightened"
or "intermediate" or "mid-level" scrutiny.5 Under this test,
which the Court adopted in the 1970's, laws and regulations that
discriminate on the basis of sex have generally been held
unconstitutional. Prior to development of the "intermediate
scrutiny" test, on the other hand, the court relied on a lower
level of scrutiny under the equal protection clause, called
"minimal scrutiny" or the "rational basis test." Under that
lower level of review, the Court virtually always upheld sex
discrimination.

        4 Testimony of Judge Souter, Tr. at 99 (Sept. 13, 1990).

        5 "intermediate" scrutiny is not as high as the "strict"
scrutiny that is given to classifications on the basis of race or
that affect fundamental rights, but it is higher than the
"minimal" scrutiny that is given to other classifications, such
as commercial classifications.
                                    965

        In several briefs and one opinion. Judge Souter had
criticized mid-level scrutiny, and in one brief even argued that
sex-based classifications should be evaluated under the rational
basis test. We were very eager to hear Judge Souter's
explanation of these writings.

        Judge Souter explained more about his views on equal
protection analysis in the context of sex discrimination, but h i \
explanation left a major question unanswered. He agreed that \
gender-based discrimination should be subject to more than the
lowest level of scrutiny afforded economic classifications.
Further, he testified that he thought the middle-tier scrutiny
for reviewing sex-based classifications is "too loose" -- that it
is "not a good, sound protection" -- that such classifications
should be reviewed under a "less flexible" standard than the mid-
level scrutiny test now employed. Similarly, he testified that
he did not necessarily reject application of the strict scrutiny
standard to sex discrimination.

        These comments suggest that Judge Souter thinks that sex
discrimination is deserving of a more exacting standard of review
than that afforded by the current mid-tier level of scrutiny.
Yet despite repeated invitations from Senators to discuss the
appropriate test. Judge Souter gave no assurances that he would
afford at_leas.t._as. much-protect ion ..from. sex.-d±scriminatory rules
as such rules currently receive. For him to have made the simple
affirmative statement that that standard should be at least as
exacting as the current test would have been so simple that its
omission is startling. Judge Souter never articulated a firm

           Tr. at 157 (September 13, 1990).
                                                        4
                                    966

commitment to eliminate invidious sex-based classifications under
the Equal Protection clause.7

            Judge Souter's mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's
approach in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center further calls into
question his understanding of the invidious nature of sex-based
distinctions under the equal protection clause.

In an exchange with Senator DeConcini, Judge Souter inaccurately
described Cleburne as explaining why sex-based classifications
were only entitled to middle-tier scrutiny -- as opposed to the
more rigorous strict scrutiny: First, "the likelihood that a
[sex-based] classification might really have a legitimate reason
behind it, a legitimate basis, and the case law, the experience
with the cases coming up in the Court's view has simply been that
there is a greater chance that there may be a legitimate basis
for some sex classification, in other words that it may not
amount to invidious discrimination than would be the case in the
racial area." And second, "in the area of sex discrimination,
there was more likely to be some political responsiveness than
our history has shown in racial discrimination, so that is why
they put it in the middle." Tr. at 211-12 (Sept. 13, 1990).

In fact, Cleburne clearly stated that sex-based distinctions are
generally not legitimate. Discussing why sex-based
classifications deserved a heightened standard of review. Justice
White wrote that "[rather] than resting on meaningful
considerations, statutes distributing benefits and burdens
between-the sexes-in different ways very likely reflect outmoded
notions of the relative capabilities of men and women." Cleburne
v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 441 (1985).

In contrast, the Cleburne Court discussed the two considerations
mentioned by Judge Souter -- the likelihood of the
classification's legitimacy and the history of political
responsiveness -- in explaining why it felt classifications based
on mental retardation should not be entitled to middle-tier
scrutiny and why the much more deferential rational basis test
should be applied instead.

Judge Souter's failure to acknowledge that Cleburne -- and the
Court's equal protection jurisprudence generally -- stand for
the proposition that sex-based distinctions are presumptively
unconstitutional further fuels our concern.
                                    967

         II. Judge Souter failed to articulate a firm commitment to
         affirmative action to enforce the rights of women and of
         people of color to equal employment opportunity.

         Fundamental to the achievement of equal employment
opportunity for women and for people of color is the use of
affirmative action -- including sex- and race-conscious efforts
-- to overcome the barriers of years of discrimination in
employment. While Judge Souter discussed affirmative action in
generally approving terms, he stopped short of endorsing it in a
number of contexts. Thus, he did not give the full commitment to
affirmative action that American women need.

          For example. Judge Souter did not fully explain the speech
in which he is reported to have stated that affirmative action is
"affirmative discrimination;" to the contrary, his "explanation"
-- that he was talking about "discrimination in the sense that
benefits were to be distributed according to some formula of
racial distribution" -- makes no sense. His disapproval of that
kind of affirmative action program suggests that the "affirmative
action" of which he does approve is much more limited than the
full breadth of affirmative action that the courts have upheld.

         Similarly, Judge Souter never expressed agreement with or
approval of another settled principle of affirmative action law:
that voluntary affirmative action, including gender- or race-
based initiatives is permissible.

         III. Judge Souter failed to acknowledge a fundamental right
         to privacy that fully protects women's rights to procreative
         choice.'

         Judge Souter's failure to endorse women's rights is most
glaring in the area of reproductive rights, it is true that he
acknowledged that he believes that the Constitution protects a
right of marital privacy from governmental intrusion. But he
rendered this statement almost meaningless when he absolutely
                                    968

refused to say whether he thought that right was "fundamental" or
to discuss in any way what governmental interests might be
sufficiently compelling to override it. For example, when asked
by senator Biden whether women have a fundamental right to
privacy after conception. Judge Souter replied,

         "[I]n the spectrum of possible protection that
         [interest] would rank as an interest to be asserted
        under liberty, but how that interest should be
        evaluated, and the weight that should be given to it in
        determining whether there is in any or all
        circumstances a sufficiently countervailing
        governmental interest is a question, with respect, I
        cannot answer."

His failure to say whether the right is a fundamental one is
crucial. If the right to privacy is not fundamental, then even
if a state law -- such as a law restricting abortions --
infringes on it. Judge Souter could find that that state law is
constitutional. In other words, he would not follow one of the
essential legal principles underlying Roe v. Wade.

        Furthermore, Judge Souter's articulation of the right to
privacy that he does accept was extremely crabbed. He was not
even willing to say that the constitutionally protected privacy
right extends to unmarried people's right to purchase

                              g
contraceptives. Nor was he willing to accept the rationale of

        8 Tr. at 120 (Sept, 13, 1990).

        9 when Senator Biden asked Judge Souter whether he believes
the privacy right extends to the right of unmarried people to
purchase contraceptives. Judge Souter said he didn't know, that
he would have to carry out an inquiry that he had not yet engaged
in: "I don't know the extent an answer to that question can be
given in the abstract without the kind of Harlan inquiry I'm
talking about. It was not made and I have not made it. . . .
[E]xactly the same kind of analysis that Harlan would have used
and did use in his concurring opinion should be used to address
the same issue of non-marital privacy." Tr. at 27 (September 17,
1990).

         Judge Souter did say that he agreed with the holding in
Eisenstadt v. Baird, the Supreme Court case striking down a
                                  969

Griswold, even though he agreed with its result -- and even
though the Griswold principles are as well settled as the
principles in other cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education,
that Judge Souter did accept.

        Even when Judge Souter did give substantive answers relating
to women's right to reproductive freedom, his answers did not
evince a commitment to that right. More than one Senator asked
Judge Souter to assess the effects of overruling Roe v. Wade. In
response to Senator Kennedy, he acknowledged that "thousands of
lives will be affected."10 This statement is ambiguous: whose
lives would be affected? Indeed, this statement could have been
made as easily by an anti-choice as by a pro-choice proponent.

        when Senator Leahy asked him this question on the morning of
September 17, Judge Souter said that if Roe were overturned, the
practical effect would be that the issue would become a matter
for different judgment in every state, which would pose
complicated issues of federalism. Senator Leahy responded by
describing a heart-rending example of a case of a botched
abortion, which he had prosecuted before Roe legalized abortion.
Senator Leahy's real-life story demonstrates his compassion and
understanding of the effect of Supreme Court rulings on real
people -- a demonstration that Judge Souter never succeeded in

state's restriction on the purchase of contraceptives by
unmarried people, but that he based his agreement not on
extension of the right of privacy but on application of equal
protection principles, because the Court had already held that
states cannot restrict the purchase of contraceptives by married
people in Griswold v. Connecticut. Tr. at 25-26 (Sept. 17,
1990).

         10 Tr. at 216 (September 17, 1990).
         1 Judge Souter said, "The issue of federalism would be a
complicated issue." Tr. at 113 (September 17, 1990).
                                    970

making, despite his repeated expressions of concern about those
effects.

         It is true that Judge Souter said that he "has not made up
his mind" -- that he has "not got any agenda on what ^should be
done with Roe v. Wade, if that case were brought before
[him]."12 This statement is a far cry, however, from
demonstrating a commitment to the underlying constitutional
principles that protect women's right to procreative choice.

         Conclusion
         The United States Supreme Court is at a crossroads. At this
time in history, any appointee to that Court must have a
demonstrated commitment to the law's most basic guarantees of
individual rights and equality -- for women and for all people.
David Souter has failed to demonstrate that commitment. For that
reason, we urge the Senate Judiciary Committee not to recommend
him, and the full Senate to reject him, as a Supreme Court
Justice.

                                   973

by all of the abore courts, there are documents signed by Disciplinary
Counsel, Jud>iary Committee, Judiciar Committee of the 13 and 14 Hawaii
State legislator you name it I'w been there an* have docuaents to prove
it. Senator Dam Inouye, Senator Edward Kennedy on* *enat*r Getrge Mitchell
all hare copies of many of the docuMents, bmt they hare chase t« do nothing
abotrt these corruptjudges. Just nore cover up because the know the Hawaii
Federal Court J«dges are also involed. You see one of these two case I will
be Mentioning was filed in Hawaii Federal Court, the orther went frist to
Hawaii State Courts and then to Hawaii Federal Court. But both cases
went all the way through the Federal Court systeM.

        I was surpised when Senator Iouye did not do anything when he knew
of a Mayor stealing Money froM the Kauai County Governerment, and he
didnot try to find oat who the union business agent was who caught that
Mayor and used that inforMation for his own benefit, oat I was More
shocked to see that Senators Iouye, Kennedy and Mitchell did not even
Care about who the Man was that fit the description of the Poipu fiapist,
the Man who raped over eight Mainland college girls. I believe thats
because Senator Iouye knows who all those people are not only because Hawaii
is so SMall but because I believe that Senator Inouye is the top Man that
controlles all of the State of Hawaii, and new it lo*ks like hB did enough
favors for soMe Senators in Congress to controll then. So I honesty beleive
that the grass roots Japanese also controlls the Senat of the United Stajtet
Congress.

         Its very inportant here to reneber that the type of case I will be
                          not

Mentioning is/Inportant to this conformation hearing, its the judges action,
its proof that the State of Hawaii is under the controll of one person and
tha recial group of that one person is in full control, and the group is
the grass roots Japanese.

         It is very important to remeMber that there are signed aid stamped
documents by the courts etc.

         I'll make the first case as short as possible keeping only to court
dftsions. This case is about Ronald Caldeira's termination from the County
of Kauai(Ronald is my son). Ronald was t-rmanated on Oct. 30. 1983.
the case went to the Hawaii Public Employment Board known as HPSRB, ..
No. CE-03-97. It went into Arbitration out Dec. 15. 198%. On Jan. 15, 1985
the Award of Arbitrartion was signed. A complaint of fraud \
was filed with HFERB an April 8, 1985 ease no. CU-O3-5O. The Chairman of
HPBRB said if Ronald wanted to break that award he had to go to Peredral
Court. The ease was filed in federal Court on July 16, 1985* One week
before it was to go to trail in Sept. 1987 the Union ft County of Kavai
                                   974

 saw it wasnot signed and stepped the case to have it signed in a state
 court. Thats ever 2 years of the tine allowed to hare it signed, the
 state judge signed it. So the Federal judge through it out.
 Thats when it started its climb to higher courts. To out this short this
  cases should met hare left HPERB because the complaint of fraud was filed
  before it was signed and because the name of the arbitariter came from an
  HPERB list. This case should hare been heard even/It was si«»ed in tine
  because any tine a complaint for fraud is fied its the courts duty to
  hear the case and deceid if its fraud. Just because the judge signed it
  that does net Mean its not a fraud. As for the United States Suprem Court
  is corrupt is that they did *et review the case they left that up to the
  court clerk. If this case can net go through a civil trial then it mis t
  go through a crinanel trial because the fraud etc.is stiU there to defame
' the working abality of Ronald, net/mentisn his raputatian and his social

   ··if-, Sut what State , County or Federal Dept. do you report it t« when
  kn«w tkey are al" tiedt«gther in ««rrupti«n, thats c«ntr«lled *y the

  Japanese. In tke State »f Hawaii if y«u are n»t Japanese y«« oan n«t
                                                                            y«ur

   get an appointed p»stti»n unless y«m pay/ dues t» the Japanese.

         Racial discrimisaii*?! inthe State «f Hawaii is s« thick you "an
cut with a knife. But »n Kau»i the Hawaii State Government and the C.unty
·f Kauai G«vBr«ment als» practice employment discrimination, they
hire and appoint only people who are born and raised on Kauai.

          Now to go into the second case, again I re»«»»ed you that its not
 the type of case it the court system that thia testitaony is about.
 This second case is a Family Court or divorce case Mine. These tvo
 cases harw gone to the Honolulu F.n.I once anrt this dir»»ee c»-" has bnem
 to th" Honolulu F.?.T twice. And it wa^ th° F » T wh» »f+er th»y '^v^o
 said that these two cases are tied together. Tkis faminy Court case was the
 first case to start, 197**. Aft»r r«l»* to over 29 attorneys, Dicsiulinary
 Counsel. -Tudic«t*y--ifiommiV>«o. Amerciam Civil Libtary's union and none
 of them-«rery told me I was wrong and none «f them would tfiT> m» «hst
 was wrong-"W&th^My-pa^erst oe my docket. It was quite by accandent I
 learned that I had a h ^ f contested and a half none contested divorce.
 And because i-t was all signed by a Japanese Jud«e no one would touch
 my cases instead e very body I went to for help turned into judges.
 So I had no choice but to take my own cases and thats how I fount out
 of the corruption in Hawaii and how the grass roots Japanese have a

                                                                                               all
 strong hold on Hawii. Remember I have not to3d you/the places I went to
 far helm like the ombudman who told me that no one would help me my only
                                    975

chance f*r help was If I could get the newspapers or T.V. station t« help,
and thats how I made my rounds te the the newspapers & T.V. stations.
I weald like te say here that even an attorney from Senator Inouye's
office who called me would tell me I did net hare a case what he said
was its to late for me te collect my damdage3. I told him who did he
think he was fooling my conititional rights to a fair trail was
Tolited and that hare no time limites. The fact is after 12 years I honestly
oelivie I am still married. All the oaper on file is fraud all the court
systems know this, out again the Japs in Hawaii controll the Peaaral court*
too all the way to the United States Superem Court.

Two federal court judges I know for sure that the Japaneses in Hawaii
controll are Hawaii's federal judg Feng the ether is Judge Robert Aguilar
who was charged with racketeering in 1989. Aguilar sat on my case in Hawaii

                       many of
when I sued/the Hawaii State judges and all the senators en the 13 and
 Ik judiciaryconunittee and many others 78 defendants in all.

         One point I'd like to make here is that when every I filed pacers
 in the courts that when the Kauai County would falsy charge and suspend
Benald. And Because I would not stop thats when the fired him. It is
my belive that they thought We would more off Kauai.

         There are documents to prove what I have seen saying, Senstors Ijneue,
Kennedy and Mitchell all have copies of many of these documents.

         I would like to end »y reading a letter I wrote to Senator Akaka
while he was with the house. But most important is his reply to that
letter which will give you a very good picture of peliclans in Hawaii,
the Japanese in Hawaii and white collar crimine in Hawaii. In my search
for justice T found that all policians in Hawaii is the same.

Ms. Barbara Jean Machado
P.O. Box 1406
Kapaa, Hawaii 96746

Dear Ms. Machado:

        This is in response to your correspondence regarding
reparations for Japanese Americans interned during Wovld War TI.

        The internment of Japanese Americans during World War XI is
one of the most tragic events in America's history. This nation
has recognized the grave injustice that was inflicted on both
citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. The
evacuation, relocation, and internment of these civilians during
World War II were largely motivated by racial prejudice, wartime
hysteria, and a lack of political leadership. As a result, this
nation has extended a formal apology and token restitution to
those who were denied their individual rights.

         The issue of redress deals with the denial of justice and
racism. No person of Japanese ancestry was ever convicted of
spying for Japan. In fact, between 1942-44, 18 Caucasians were
charged with spying, at least ten were convicted. Nevertheless,
Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps and denied
their constitutional rights.

         The 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442 Regimental Combat
Team, which included Senators Inouye and Matsunaga, were the most
highly decorated military units during World War II. Hundreds
lost their lives and many more were wounded--they were not a
"fraud outfit". On the contrary, these soldiers were loyal
citizens who fought bravely for their country and their families.

         On July 15, 1946, President Truman presented the
Presidential Distinguished Unit Citation to the 100/442 RCT. He
stated, "You fought not only the enemy, but you fought
prejudice--and you won. Keep up that fight, and we will continue
to win--to make this great Republic stand for just what the
Constitution says it stands for." It is tragic that the fight
against prejudice still continues today.

                                                                Aloha pumehana,

 The Honorable Joseph E. Biden, Jr., Chairman
 Senate Committee on the Judiciary
 SD 224, Dirksen Senate Office Building
 Washington, DC 20510-6275

 Subject: Hearing on the nomination of Judge Souter

Dear Mr. Chairman:

 Thank you for your kind letter of September 6, 1990.

A member of your staff notified me by phone September 11, 1990, of your
decision to deny my request to be heard and to question the nominee on
separation of powers. He also told me that I would be permitted to file
a statement for the record. Accordingly, please accept this letter as my
statement and include it in the official public record of the confirmation
hearing on the nomination of Judge Souter to become an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court.

At the outset, Constitution, Article III, section 2, paragraph 2, second
sentence provides that the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction
 in all other cases, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under
such regulations as the Congress shall make. Pursuant to that constitutional
provision, Congress made the rules governing the practice and procedure in
the Supreme Court for 160 years.

In 19^9, the rule making power prescribed by the Constitution was transferred
by Congress to the Supreme Court. Act of May 2k, 19^9, Chap. 39, section 102
62 Stat. 10U, amending 28 USC 2071.

While Congress was making the rules pursuant to the Constitution, the rules
governing the practice and procedure in the Supreme Court were an Integral
part of the supreme Law of the land by constitutional definition under
Article VI, 2d paragraph.

When the Court was given the rule making power by Congress, the old rules
including the rules relating to evidence were discarded. New rules were
promulgated by the Court in I95U substituting oral argument for the old
rules relating to evidence.

                                   980

Senator Biden

The Congressional transfer of the rule making power was not then nor is now
sanctioned by any substantive provision of the Constitution of the United
States. In any case, the new rules governing the practice and procedure in
the Supreme Court do not qualify as part of the supreme law of the land
because they were not made pursuant to the Constitution.

The 19^9 technical amendment to the Judicial Code of the United States not
only violated the principle of separation of powers, but also destroyed one
of our most important constitutional checks and balances. Besides destroying
the last vestige of our constitutional system of checks and balances, the
19^9 amendment opened the door to unprecedented Judicial legislation by the
Court.

If you had allowed me to speak, I would have questioned the nominee along
the following lines:

1. What provisions for separation of powers are made in our State
Constitutions and Bills of Rights?

2. Where do fuch provisions come from?

3. What provisions for separation of powers are made in the Constitution
of the United States?

k. Where do such provisions come from?

5. What happens when one branch exercises the powers or performs the
functions of the other "tttf* or either of them?

6. What does the principle of separation of pSrers mean?

7. Do you agree with the position take by John Marshall during Virginia's
ratifying convention that the Constitution, if ratified, would ensure a
regulated democracy?

8. What was the basis for Marshall's position?

9. Do you agree with the position taken by James Madison on the floor of
the first Congress that the principle which separates our powers of
government is the most sacred principle of the Constitution, indeed of any
free constitution?

10. What was the basis for Madison's position?

11. Do you agree that Congress made the rules governing the practice and
procedure in the Supreme Court for 160 years pursuant to the second sentence
of the second paragraph of section 2 of Article III of the Constitution?
12. Do you agree that Congress transferred the rule making power to the
Supreme Court in 19^9 by & technical amendment to the Judicial Code?
13- What substantive provision of the Constitution sanctioned the transfer
of the rule making power to the Court?
Ik. Do you agree that the old rules made by Congress pursuant to the
Constitution qualified as an integral part of the supreme law of the land
by constitutional definition under Article VI, 2d Paragraph?
15- What happened to the old rules relating to evidence?
16. What did the Court substitute for the rules relating to evidence?
17- Do the new rules promulgated by the Court without constitutional
sanction qualify as part of the supreme law of the land under Article VI,
2d paragraph?
18. If confirmed, how can you in good conscience and without reservation
give your oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States
when the rules governing the practice and procedure in the Supreme Court
are not sanctioned by the Constitution?

Subject: Hearing on the nomination of Judge Souter

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I wish to file objections to the general line of questions being asked of
Judge Souter.

1. The questions are designed to preserve Judicial legislation not
         sanctioned by the Constitution.

2. The questions are designed to cover up flagrant violations of the
         principle of separation of povers.

5- The questions are designed to cover up the destruction of our
         constitutional system of checks and balances.

In support of my objections, I am attaching a copy of my 1971* report to
the Virginia State Bar.

Please include this letter and the attached exhibit In the official public
record of the confirmation hearings on the nomination of Judge Souter to
become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

Thank you very much for your courtesy and consideration.

                                     DISCLAIMER

The following report is the product of my personal
experience and basic research. The findings of-fact
and conclusions of law are mine and do not necessarily
represent the views, opinions or conclusions of the
officers and members of the Virginia State Bar.

                SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL
            JURISDICTION RULES AND PROCEDURE

                                             Foreword

Purpose
  This report is designed to uncover the destruction of our constitutional system

of checks and balances by prior Congresses of the United States and to expose
the curret cover up effort of the 93d Congress.

Scope
  The Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedures fo-

cused primarily on rules of evidence, division xti jurisdiction, executive privi-
lege, impeachment, and separation of powers. Five relevant legislative pro-
posals were selected out of many for discussion.

Effect
   Hopefully, the practical effect of this report will be to strip off the double

standard of conduct enshrouding "Watergate" and related matters including the
current impeachment proceedings. The beneficial effect will be to shed new
light on fundamental principles of constitutional law once taken for granted
and long since forgotten.

                                            Background

Thirty-filth Annual Meeting
   This report is directly attributable to the splendid presentation by the panel

on the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence at the 35th annual meeting of the
Virginia State Bar. The panel recommended the appointment of a committee to
study the proposed rules and to make suggestions on or before July 30, 1973.

Committee
   By letter dated June 22, 1973, President Howard created the Committee to

36  VIRGINIA BAR NEWS
               987

Study Federal Rules of Evidence and named John B. Minnick as chairman and
Gregory U. Evans and Plato Cacheris as members to serve with him.

  The committee immediately secured copies of the hearings, bill, and related
materials on H.R. 5463 on the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence.
Preliminary Report

   A preliminary report was submitted July 23, 1973, to point out_among other
things that the proposed rules, hearings, and related materials raised serious
constitutional questions under the doctrine of separation of powers.
Enlargement

   In the meantime, S. 1876 on the proposed division of jurisdiction between
State and Federal courts was referred to the committee for study and comment.
Additionally, the committee was redesignated the Special Committee on Fed-
eral Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure and its functions were enlarged to in-
clude monitoring Congress. The work and plans of the Special Committee were
outlined and reported at the fall conference in Staunton.
Preliminary Report

   In a preliminary report dated September 26, 1973, the Special Committee
pointed out that the principal question raised by the proposed Federal Rules of
Evidence involved the doctrine of the separation of our powers of government
under the first three articles of the Constitution; and that the big question raised
by the proposed division of jurisdiction between State and Federal courts in-
volved the concept of the equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth
Amendment as applied to both State and Federal Governments by the courts.
The Special Committee also announced that it planned to ask for hearings on
the constitutional questions raised by both bills, and requested that the an-
nouncement be circulated. The announcement was published in the November-
December 1973 issue of the Virginia Bar News.
Monitoring Service

   The monitoring services of the Special Committee picked up information on
several legislative proposals including H.R. 12135 and H.R. 12462 on amend-
ments to the Freedom of Information Act,- S. 2803 to insure the separation of
constitutional powers by establishing the Department of Justice as an inde-
pendent establishment of the United States, and S. 2978 to establish a special
commission to study the establishment of an independent permanent mecha-
nism for the investigation and prosecution of official misconduct and other of-
fenses committed by high Government officials. The particular relevance of
these legislative proposals determined the thrust of this report.

                                    The Legislative Proposals

H.R. 5463 Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence
   This legislative proposal originated in a suggestion made by former Chief

Justice Warren; but the suggestion was caused by the so-called "enabling acts"
which gave the Court the power to prescribe the rules, and in particular by the
last one contained in the Act of May 24, 1949, Ch. 39, section 103, 63 Stat. 104.
The provisions of that Act gave the Supreme Court the power to make its own
rules and constituted a grant of the legislative power reserved to the Congress
as one of our checks and balances under Article III of the Constitution.

   After the Court was given the power to make its own rules, it proceeded to
   E r r a t u m : The c i t a t i o n above s h o u l d read Act of May 2k,

                     19^9 Ch. 39, s e c t i o n 102, 62 S t a t . 4

adopt its own rules and of course threw out the old rules including the rules re-
lating to evidence. Since the new rules do not constitute part of the supreme law
of the land under Article VI of the Constitution, the suggestion by former Chief
Justice Warren appears to have been made in an obvious effort to cover up the
destruction of one of our constitutional checks and balances.

   After the suggestion was made by the Chief Justice, a special committee was
appointed to study the feasibility of establishing uniform rules of evidence
for the Federal judicial system. The special committee determined that it was
feasible. An Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence was appointed and H.R.
5463 is the result of the work of the Advisory Committee. When that commit-
tee commenced its work, however, it established several criteria, one of which
was the avoidance of constitutional issues. Hearings, page 91; Congressional
Record for Wednesday, January 30, 1974, page H 307.

   H.R. 5463 encountered a stormy reception in Congress and the rules as pro-
posed by the Advisory Committee were rejected. Pub. L. 93-12. March 30, 1973,
87 Stat. 9; see also. 119 Cong. Rec. No. 22. February 7. 1973. S 2241-2242: 119
Cong. Rec, No. 40, March 14, 1973, H 1721-1731"; 119 Cong. Rec, No. 42,
March 19, 1973, S 4493-5009; Federal Bar Journal, Evidence, Part I, Volume 32,
Number4, Fall 1973.

   While the debates were going on in Congress, the Special Subcommittee on
Reform of Federal Criminal Laws of the House Committee on the Judiciary was
holding hearings on the proposed rules of evidence. Those hearings demon-
strate the failure to account for fundamental principles of constitutional law de-
spite some self serving statements seemingly to the contrary. Thus it appears
that "Constitutional issues would be avoided to the extent possible, on the the-
ory that the formulation of rules was not in general an appropriate method of
resolving them." Hearings, page 91; see also, Hearings, page 35; and the Con-
gressional Record for Wednesday, January 30, 1974, page H 307. ~

   As a result of the 1973 hearings and mark up session, most of the contro-
versial provisions of the proposed rules were eliminated, and a much modified
version of H.R. 5463 was reported to the House November 15, 1973. H. Rept.
No. 93-650, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. The proposed rules as revised by the House
Committee on the Judiciary were passed by the House with floor amendments,
February 6, 1974, 120 Cong. Rec, No. 12, page H 570; and referred to the Sen-
ate. H.R. 5463 as modified by the House was read twice in the Senate and re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary. 120 Cong. Rec, No. 13, February 7,
1974,S 1552.

   The Special Committee has requested a hearing on the constitutional issues.
   There are other defects in the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence. The Ad-
visory Committee's notes, the hearings, the committee report and related ma-
terials do not establish a need for black letter statutory rules of evidence. The
danger of a black letter statutory rule on presumptions is glossed oyer under the
guise of labelling the rule a technical matter. The treatment of evidence general-
ly and hearsay in particular fails to account for the fundamental rule of exclu-
sion where the evidence is not competent to prove the truth of the matter as-
serted.
S. 1876 Proposed Division ofJurisdiction between State and Federal Courts

   As in the case of the proposed rules of evidence, the proposed division of
jurisdiction arose out of a suggestion by former Chief Justice Warren. In pro-
posing the study, he stated:

38  VIRGINIA BAR NEWS
                                        989

     "It is essential that we achieve a proper jurisdictional balance between
  Federal and State court systems, assigning to each system those cases most
  appropriate in light of basic principles of federalism."
  The American Law Institute acted upon his suggestion and made a ten-year
study of the jurisdiction of Federal Courts. S. 1876 is the result of that study
and covers six broad areas of Federal jurisdiction: diversity of citizenship; Fed-
eral question jurisdiction; jurisdiction of the United States as a party; admiralty
jurisdiction; jurisdiction of three-judge courts; and multi-party-multi-state liti-
gation.
   The initial suggestion by the Chief Justice did not account for the fact that the
judicial power of the United States under the Constitution does not extend to the
assignment of the jurisdiction of the State courts; and neither does the legisla-
tive power in the absence of a proper amendment.
   Aside from the ramifications of the American Law Institute proposal, the bill
is described at the very outset as "lawyers' law." Hearings, page 98. As such, the
proposal is reduced to an effort to impose a set of arbitrary standards for the
benefit of the legal profession without regard to the rights of the people to the
equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Ac-
cordingly, the proposalmay be classified as a rule of men and not of law.
   The Special Committee-on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure has re-
quested a hearing on the constitutional aspects of the proposed division of juris-
diction.

H. R. 12135 and H. R. 12462 To Amend the Freedom of Information Act.
   H/R. 12462 is the result of executive mark ups of H.R. 12135. The basic pro-

posal to amend the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. (1970 ed.) section 552,
originated in the efforts of the courts and Congress to get information from the
executive branch and involves the executive privilege concept. Additionally, the
hearings, bills and related materials manifest an effort to lay a foundation for
contempt proceedings in order to lend some color of criminality to possible im-
peachment charges. See particularly, the provisions of the bills for filing law
suits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; see also,
Hearings, pages 6113 et seq.

   Of course the difficulty with the proposal lies in the fact that 5 U.S.C. sec-
tion 552 is part of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 237, as
codified and enacted into positive law in 1966, 80 Stat. 378, 381-388, now 5
U.S.C. (1970 ed.) sections 551-559. By the express terms of the Administrative
Procedure Act, the executive branch and the so-called "independent agencies"
were given the power to "prescribe law or policy". 5 U.S.C. (1970 ed.) section
551. The grant of legislative power by Congress to the executive branch is not
only inconsistent with our great American doctrine of separation of powers, it
also destroys our constitutional system of checks and balances. Additionally, the
grant of legislative power to the executive branch is the proximate cause for the
recent assertions of executive privilege.

S. 2803 To Insure the Separation of Constitutional Powers by Establishing the
Department of Justice as an Independent Establishment of the United States

   This legislative proposal is the product of the constitutional confusion gen-
erated by the destruction of our constitutional system of checks and balances by
prior Congresses of the United States; and, as such, manifests an effort in the
93d Congress to cover up that destruction.

MAY-JUNE 1974  39
                                         990

S. 2978 To Establish a Special Commission to Study the Establishment of an
Independent Permanent Mechanism for the Investigation and Prosecution of
Official Misconduct and other Offenses Committed by High Government Of-
ficials.

   This proposal arises out of the same problem, namely, "Watergate," that pro-
duced S. 2803 and H.R. 12462. As such, it represents another layer in the at-
tempted cover up of the destruction of our constitutional system of cheeks and
balances.

                                             Discussion

  The Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure has un-
covered two of the specific Acts of Congress which have destroyed our consti-
tutional system of checks and balances. In addition, the Special Committee de-
sires to point out that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent one branch
of government from exercising the power of the other two branches. Accord-
ingly, the only constitutional way to insure the separation of our powers of gov-
ernment is not to give any of them away.

   By the act of giving away constitutional powers, the Congress of the United
States has not only made it impossible to maintain the separation of powers, it
has also reduced us to a government of men and not of law.

   "Watergate" is merely the manifestation of the constitutional confusion of
the rules generated by the "giveaway" acts of Congress. The impeachment pro-
ceedings stand on no better footing. Those proceedings are the direct result of
the confusion and reflect the charges and countercharges generated when one
branch of government compounds the mistakes and errors of another branch.

   Since the problem is essentially a question of the rules, the Special Committee
on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure desires to furnish a brief analysis of
the real reason for the separation of our powers of government.

   The Legislative Branch operates under the rules of parliamentary pro-
cedure.

   The Executive Branch operates under administrative rules and regulations
including executive orders.

   The Judicial Branch operates under the rules of court subject to the rules of
evidence.

   The rules of parliamentary procedure do not work in the Executive and Judi-
cial Branches.

   Administrative rules, regulations and executive orders do not work in the Legis-
lative and Judicial Branches.

   Rules of court and evidence do not work in the Executive and Legislative
Branches.

   The reason why the rules of one branch do not work in the other two branches
is essentially a matter of functions.

   The legislative function is essentially a policy making function.
   The executivejunction is essentially a policy keeping function.
   The judicial function is essentially a policy applying function.
   When all three branches are actively engaged in making national policy,
there are bound to be not only honest differences of opinion, but also dia-
metrically opposed points of view.
   "Watergate" with its ramifications including impeachment proceedings is a

classic example of what can happen when all three branches are busy exercis-
ing legislative powers. In short, the current confusion in government today is
directly attributable to the destruction of our constitutional system of checks
and balances by the Congress of the United States.

                                          Findings

  The Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure finds:
   1. The hearings, debates, committee report and related materials on H.R.
5463 do not demonstrate any real need for black letter statutory rules of evi-
dence. Additionally, the hearings, debates, committee report, and the proposed
Federal Rules of Evidence demonstrate not only a failure to account for elemen-
tary principlesof jurisprudence, but also the deliberate avoidance of constitu-
tional issues.
   2. The hearings and related materials on S. 1876 do not demonstrate any real
need for the division of jurisdiction between State and Federal Courts. Addi-
tionally, the hearings and related materials demonstrate an insensitivity to the
rteeds of the people as well as a general avoidance of constitutional issues.
   3. The hearings and related materials on H.R. 12462 demonstrate the efforts
in the 93d Congress to cover up the destruction of our constitutional system of
checks and balances.
   4. S. 2803 and S. 2978 demonstrate further efforts in the 93d Congress to
cover up the destruction of our constitutional system of checks and balances.
   5. The impeachment proceedings manifest the overall effort to cover up the
destruction of our constitutional system of checks and balances.

                                        Conclusions

   The Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure con-
cludes:

   1. Our education in thefieldof Constitutional Law has been sadly neglected.
   2. The Executive and Judicial Branches have compounded the mistakes and
errors committed by the Legislative Branch.
   3. The 93d Congress is fatally bent on covering up the destruction of our con-
stitutional system of checks and balances.

                                     Recommendations

   The Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction Rules and Procedure recom-
mends:

   1. Establishment of a permanent standing committee on Constitutional Law.
   2. Transfer the functions of the Special Committee on Federal Jurisdiction
 Rules and Procedure to the permanent standing committee on Constitutional
 Law.
   3. Conduct a Constitutional Workshop at the Thirty-Sixth Annual Meeting of
 the Virginia State Bar.
   4. Establish Constitutional Workshops in the Law Schools of Virginia.
   5. Conduct the pilot project at the Washington and Lee University Law
 School in conjunction with its student research progjam.

   I. UNDER SACRED OATU TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST ALL ENEMIES
   FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, WILL THE NOMINEE, AS A JUSTICE ON THE U. S.
   SUPREME COURT, PROPOUND THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDING PRINCIPLES FOR
   -REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW
   UNDER GOD," reasserted by President Reagan, July 4, 1982:

           We are founded to legislate, propagate,a nd secure Christianity (western
         civilization), by the Christian comon law; nothing be done to hurt Christianity.
         Bring infidels and savages unto human civility for a quiet and settled gov-
         ernment, which cannot place Christianity in jeopardy, nor offend it. The
         morality of the nation is deeply engrafted upon Christianity. It is the duty of
         government to deter no-religion beliefs; secularisn is unconstitutional, pre-
         ferring those who disbelieve over those who do believe...The First Amendment was
         never intended to reduce Christianity to the levels of Judaism, Islamism, nor
         infidelity,(nor satanism, now propagated with public taxes). Holy Trinity Church,

II. Hill the Nominee support C. J. Rehnquist loyalty against the Soviet Constitution,
Art. 25 on "separation of church and state," and the deceptive judicial "three-prong
test" - Lemon Test, imposed unconstittuionally by J. Brennan, usurping Constitutional
moral order, and usurping Parental Sovereignty, Board of Educstion v Pico,198 ?

III. Will the Nominee by duty of the Oath, a religious committment, DEFEND against
anti-American internationalization imposed by the unconstitutional UNESCO Great Society
Programs for the Soviet Constitution , "classless society, centralized education,
socialization, 'legalized' militant labor union laws" which subvert the Constitution by
centralized education and separation of church and state for international militant
atheism -- destruction of western civliization, officially recognized in the Education
Report to President Reagan, 1983, WE ARE A NATION AT RISK BY AN ACT OF UNDECLARED WAR?

IV. In Bondage to the U. S. Constitution, will the Nominee emphasize:
     1) U. S. Christianity is the ONLY religion in the world which Constitutionally
     guarantees individualism for orderly citizens, Christian or non-Christian.

     2) ONLY IN A CHRISTIAN NATION DO CHRISTIANS HAVE CIVIL RIGHTS. ONLY IN A CHRISTIAN
     NATION DO NON-CHRISTIANS, AWAY FROM THEIR LAND OF ORIGIN HAVE CIVIL RIGHTS, AND FAR
     MORE THAN AS A MAJORITY IN THEIR FATHERLAND. DENY CHRISTIAN ETHICS, AND NONE SHALL
     KNOW FREEDOM.

     3) God never endowed the anti-Godly with God-given, unalienable rights to molest
     and destroy Godly living - western civiliztion Christianity.

    4) The Holy Scriptures forbid the subordination of the Supremacy of the New
     Testament, the basis for the U. S. Christian Constitution, SIGNED IN THE YEAR OF
                                      994

OUR LORD, SUNDAYS EXEMPT FROM VETO DAYS.

5) The common culture is 96Z Christian by founding purpose to secure Christianity by
Euro-Christian concepts on color, race, religion, economy, education, economy --
the TOTAL CULTURE, for ONLY IN A CHRISTIAN NATION DO CHRISTIANS HAVE CIVIL RIGHTS,
 WILLING TO SHARE THOSE RIGHTS AND THEIR BLESSINGS OF FREEDOM WITH ALL ORDERLY CITIZENS.

      To those demanding "You cannot put your religion on me," will the Nominee
      by Constittutional Divine Law guides in free government reassert, A CHRISTIAN
      NATION IS ENTITLED TO A CHRISTIAN ADMINISTRATION, with no considerations for
       the social convenience of abortions by deliberate murder of the unborn?

       "OUR CONSTITUTION WAS MADE FOR RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE FOR
      THE GOVERNMENT OF ANY OTHER." John Adams. Only through religious people can
      a nation uphold a moral order by Divine Law, citizens educated in the self-
      discipline by public conscience for self-government -- mutual respect and consi-
      deration -- ALL AS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, Title 36, U.S.C. 172; and THE BIBLE IS
      THE ROCK OF OUR REPUBLIC, guaranteed, U. S. Constitution, Art. IV, Sec.4, against
      the invading corruption of the international militant atheism, Public Law 97-280,
      1980. We are a Christian Nation, entitled to a Christian administration, the
      U. S. Christian Constitution is our Supreme Law, and any to the contrary are
     null and void.

                                                                                            Submitted by,

Senator Joseph Biden            September 19, 1990
Room 224 Dirksen Building
Washington, D.C. 20510

         I would like to request that you include my letter as a
part of the public record submitted in conjunction with the
hearings held in the confirmation process for Judge David Souter.
I believe that my testimony is vital to understanding the issues
raised by the Senators on the Judiciary Committee. The women
panelists who purported to represent the views of the women of
America do not represent my views or the views of the majority
of the women of America.

         First, the testimony heard and entered into the public
record did not include the testimony from Women Exploited by
Abortion. An organization with 6,000 members, all women who
feel that abortion is the worst of many choices available to
women. Women who grieve over the loss of their children and the
way they were used and deceived by the abortion propagandists.
I concur with their position, not because somebody is paying me
to speak for them, but because I've experienced their loss, their
pain and their sorrow.

         When I was in college, as a very immature and unworldly freshman,
I became sexually active. Perhaps because of my dancer's training
I was aware of a change that occurred in my body the moment of
conception and within weeks of conceiving I went to the South
West Texas State University Infirmary to get advice, and infor-
mation. They sent me to the Planned Parenthood in Austin. At
Planned Parenthood I was told the test was positive, asked if I
had enough money for "the procedure" and told they would take
care of "my problem". The procedure was too horrifying and
painful to adequately describe with the doctor's knife cutting and
sawing and the dreadful sound of the suction machine making me
feel as if it were tearing out my heart as well as "the contents
of my womb". I went home to my apartment and went to bed where
friends found me 3 days later with a raging fever that very nearly
killed me. They took me to the University infirmary where I was
given antibiotics. I didn't find out until many years later that
the doctor who had performed the abortion had lacerated the wall
of my womb and my colon. The ensuing infection had destroyed my
tubes and filled my abdomen with scar tissue rendering me sterile
and ending my career in the dance. Abortion was the only "choice"
Planned Parenthood offered me. Abortion destroyed my first child,
my ability to bear children and my chosen career.

         Secondly, the testimony heard and entered into the public
record did not include the testimony from such groups as Concerned
Women of America. An organization with 700,000 members who have
worked tirelessly for years to address women's and children's
issues in a way which protects children and promotes women's
dignity and worth. The testimony ignored the sincere convictions
of the National Right to Life organization with over 1,000,000
members and over 3,000 local chapters or the women who are the
members of Dr. James Dobson's Focus on the Family with a member-
ship of over 1,900,000! The testimony disregarded the beliefs of
the 750,000 to 1,000,000 people from all" over the United States
who came to Washington this spring to stand up and be counted ai
Fro-Life.

         I feel sorry for those hard women who feel they must build
women's freedom on the death of our children and on methods which
destroy a woman's ability to provide and nurture life. But these
very highly paid spokeswomen for the abortion industry do not
represent me or the majority of the women of America. These
women who demand that the Supreme Court continue to protect thier
"right" to kill unborn children are completely ignoring the views
and feelings of the millions of women involved in the struggle
to provide compassionate alternatives to abortion. Sheltering
homes and physicians fees. Diapers and financial support. Baby-
sitting and transportation. These highly paid spokeswomen are
completely ignoring the millions of couples who wait with open
arms to adopt and love a child conceived under difficult or seeming
ly impossible circumstances.

         Finally, the women are ignoring the feelings of the children.
I would like to see Norma McCorvey's now grown daughter impanelled
to give her testimony and her feelings on abortion. I would like
to see pictures of my own beautiful adopted daughter included as
testimony. Her story represents every reason used to justify
abortion except incest. Her natural mother was raped. A young
handicapped woman, she was taking medication which causes severe
birth defects. She lost her job and her insurance just weeks
before she received confirmation that she was between 6 and 7
months pregnant. Her doctors said she would not be able to carry
the child to term and gave her one option: Abortion. They said
that the abortion would cost her between $1800.00 and $3500.00
depending on the complications they might encounter. The fact
that the doctors mentioned that there might be complications is
what saved my daughter's life. Her natural Mom, though handi-
capped from a childhood head injury could not reconcile going
ahead with something that sounded so dangerous. She sought
counsel from a local Birthright organization. The counselor
there made sure she had ALL the facts and ALL of the options

                                 DAVID SOUTER, THE DARK SIDE
        Statement by Daniel H. Pollitt, Professor of Law

                               University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

        David Souter, carefully groomed, scrubbed and coached,
presented himself to the Senate Judiciary Committee as an
articulate, thoughtful, moderate and mainstream constitutional
lawyer; a not unattractive nominee for the Supreme Court. What
we saw we may not get. His record as a New Hampshire prosecutor
and judge tells us there is more to this "stealth" candidate then
met the eye in three days of televised hearings. There is a
darker side, concealed both by what he said and by what he
refused to say. Lets look for the real David Souter. Lets look
at his record.

                                         JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY
         The Supreme Court is the ultimate guardian of the
fundamental rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.
But how are these basic rights and liberties -- Due Process of
Law, Equal Protection, Freedom of Speech, Establishment of
Religion -- to be read, construed and interpreted? Chief Justice
John Marshall, early on in our Constitutional history,
interpreted the Constitution broadly to meet current needs:
because the Constitution was "intended to endure for ages to
come" and because "It would have been an unwise attempt to
provide by immutable rules for exigencies which, if foreseen at
all, must have been seen dimly and which can be best provided for

                                                         1
                                     1002

as they occur." McColloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).
Robert Bork, on the other hand, interprets the constitution
narrowly, and three years ago torpedoed his nomination to the
Supreme Court with his claim that our Constitutional rights are
frozen in time as of 1787 when the Constitution was ratified by
We The People. Under his cribbed theory, the Supreme Court was
wrong when it ended school segregation in the 1954 Brown
decision.

         Where does David Souter stand? With John Marshall or with
Robert Bork? He told the Senate Committee that sometimes, Judges
could find meaning in the Constitution beyond the words of its
text and the specific intent of its framers. Here he seemed to
stand with John Marshall. But there is another David Souter.
Interviewed earlier this year Souter stated that on
constitutional matters, "I am of the interpretivist school." The
"interpretivist school" limits constitutional protection to those
rights "the Framers had consciously in mind," those rights
identified "by specific language of the Constitution."
Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. May 28, 1990.

         As a Judge on the New Hampshire Supreme Court he applied the
state constitution in this restrictive, "Borkian" fashion.
Estate of Henry Dionne. 518 A.2d 178 (N.H. 1986). A New
Hampshire law authorized litigants to call special sessions of
the probate court upon payment to the probate judge of $175.00
per day. The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that this
practice violated the 1784 New Hampshire Constitution, which
                                     1003

guaranteed to "every subject of the state" the right to obtain
justice freely "without being obliged to purchase it." The Court
ruled that "the spectacle of a citizen or attorney giving cash in
one hand and receiving a judicial hearing and decision in the
other is one that can no longer be tolerated."

         Judge David Souter could tolerate it, and dissented. The
Court's "interpretative task" he wrote "is to determine the
meaning of the Constitutional language as it was understood when
the farmers proposed it and the people ratified it," i.e. back in
1784. But he went centuries further back then that. The 1784
New Hampshire Constitution has it roots in the Magne Carta, when
in 1215 on the fields of Runnymede King John agreed with his
mutinous barons that "to no one will we sell, to no one will we
deny, or delay, right or justice."

         The purpose of this provision of the Magna Carta, wrote
Souter in 1986, was to end "the evil practice of the Anglo-
Norman King in extorting money from the administration or
retardation of justice." Souter reasoned that since the 1784 New
Hampshire Constitution went back to Magna Carta, it too, must
have been "intended to forbid bribery, not the imposition of fees
and costs." Therefore to him, the New Hampshire "rent a probate
judge" law was constitutional.

         Is Souter a Bork in John Marshall clothing? The record so
indicates.

              STARE DECISIS AND ADHERENCE TO JUDICIAL PRECEDENT
         An unanswered question is whether Souter, if confirmed, will
                                     1004

respect or reverse the decision in Roe v. Wade, which protects
women's freedom to choose an abortion in the first two trimesters
of pregnancy. Will he follow precedent, i.e. apply the legal
doctrine of stare decisis, or will he follow his own
predilections, go his own way?

         His record demonstrates that, like other judges, he respects
the stare decisis doctrine in areas of property and commercial
law "where people have arranged their affairs in reliance upon
the expected stability of a decision." But in areas of
constitutional protections, his record demonstrates a willingness
to reverse established liberties. Suffice here one illustration.
Others occur throughout the following sections.

         The Fourth Amendment guarantees "the right of the people" to
be secure in their "persons, houses, papers and effects" against
"unreasonable searches and seizures." In 1914 the Supreme Court
held that when the federal police break into a man's house
without a search warrant, they may not utilize the lottery
tickets seized in the illegal search as evidence in the
subsequent criminal trial. Were it otherwise, reasoned the
Court, "the protection of the Fourth Amendment ... might as well
be stricken from the Constitution." Weeks v. United States. 232
U.S. 383, 393 (1914). Six year later, Justice Holmes reaffirmed
the so-called "exclusionary rule" because without its "deterrent
standard" the Fourth Amendment "would have been reduced to a form
of words." Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States. 251 U.S.
385, 392 (1920). In 1961 the Supreme Court extended the
                                     1005

"exclusionary rule" to state trials in a case where local
policemen, without a warrant, forced their way into a house,
ransacked it from top to bottom, seized some obscene pictures
from a trunk, and used them as evidence in a subsequent criminal
trial. Justice Clark wrote that "without the exclusionary rule"
the assurance against unreasonable searches and seizures would be
"valueless" and "undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of
inestimable human liberties." Mapp v. Ohio. 367 U.S. 643, 655
(1961). Despite all this, in 1971 Attorney General David Souter
urged the Supreme Court to overrule Mapp v. Ohio and the
exclusionary rule. Petition of New Hampshire for Rehearing in
Coolidae v. New Hampshire. So much for a half century of legal
precedent.

                                             WOMEN'S RIGHTS
         Justice Brennan, whose vacant Supreme Court seat Judge
Souter might fill, recognized that "Our Nation has had a long and
unfortunate history of sex discrimination" rationalized by an
attitude of "romantic paternalism" which in practical effect,
"put women not on a pedestal but in a cage." Frontiero v.
Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973). Since the early 1970s the
Supreme Court under Brennan's urging, has been in the vanguard of
the movement to open wide the cage doors, and give women
opportunities and responsibilities equal to those enjoyed by men.
         This advance was achieved by changing the standard by which
the court reviewed discriminatory gender laws. Prior to 1970,
the Supreme Court looked with a blind eye when reviewing sexiest
                                     1006

laws, and sustained them whenever a "rational basis" could be
hypothesized for the gender discrimination. Discriminatory laws
almost always were sustained under this lax standard of review.
In the 1970s come a "heightened scrutiny" standard of review
whereby discriminatory laws were invalidated unless the state
could prove as a fact that the gender discrimination was
"substantially related to the necessary achievement of an
important government interest." Craig v. Boren. 429 U.S. 190
(1976). Few discriminatory laws passed this higher, more
stringent, level of review.

         In 1978, Attorney General David Souter petitioned the
Supreme Court to abandon the "heightened standard of review" and
go back to the lax, "rational basis," "anything goes" standard of
review which prevailed in former years. Petition for Writ of
Certiorari in Helaemoe v. Meloon. No. 77-1058 (Jan. 25, 1978 at
pp. 18-19).

         This is his record, possibly difficult for a non-lawyer to
appreciate, but deadly in operation.

         There is more to the Souter anti-feminist record.
         At one time in rape cases the victim would be cross examined
about her sexual life-style, former boy friends, and the like to
prove that she had consented to the defendant's sexual assault.
There was general revolt against putting the victim of crime on
trial this way. After all, even a prostitute can be raped. New
Hampshire was one of the many states to enact a "rape shield" law
which prohibits evidence concerning sexual activity between the
                                     1007

victim and any person "other than the defendant." Despite New
Hampshire's "rape shield law," Judge Souter held that it was
error from the trial court to exclude evidence to the effect that
earlier in the afternoon of the alleged rape, the victim had
engaged in "sexually suggestive behavior" at a bar by "sitting in
the lap of one of defendant's companions" and "hanging all over
everyone." State v. Colbath. 540 A.2d 1212 (N.H. 1988).

         Professor Susan Estrich, an expert on such matters, wrote
that this ruling "reflects the most traditional, backward, sexist
view of women and sexual relations."

         He affirmed his "backward view" on the status of women in
his brief in a case called Woolev v. Maynard. New Hampshire
required all licence plates to carry the state motto "Live Free
or Die." For religious reasons, Mr. and Mrs. Maynard obliterated
these objectionable words from their license plates. Mr. Maynard
(but not Mrs. Maynard) was convicted three times in the local
court for "Misuse of Plates." He did not appeal in the state
court system but instead, with his wife as a co-plaintiff, filed
suit in the federal court for protection of their religious
liberty. Souter moved the federal court to dismiss the case
because Mr. Maynard had failed to "exhaust his state remedies" by
filing an appeal with the New Hampshire Supreme Court. He could
not repeat this argument against Mrs. Maynard, as she had never
been prosecuted. Instead he down played her very "personhood"
with the argument that "but for the religious convictions and
criminal conduct of Mr. Maynard, it is highly doubtful that Mrs.
                                      1008

Maynard would have instituted federal litigation."
         This comment takes one back to Oliver Twist and the days

when the law held the husband responsible for the crimes of his
wife. When Mr. Bumble was informed that he was guilty of his
wife's crime "for the law supposes that your wife acted under
your direction" his ringing reply was "if the law supposes that
the law is a ass--a idiot." The law has come a long way since a
wife was considered an appendage of her husband, leaving David
Souter behind in the dark decades of Charles Dickens.

                                FREEDOM TO CHOOSE AN ABORTION
         The most important and hotly-contested issue of women's
privacy rights is the right to choose an abortion, established
back in 1973 in the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade. Souter
does not support freedom of choice. In 1976 the federal
government required the states to reimburse Medicaid-eligible
women for the cost of abortions. Attorney General Souter fought
this requirement in the courts. Why? Because "Many thousands of
New Hampshire residents find the use of tax revenues to finance
the killing of unborn children morally repugnant." (emphasis
supplied) Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for
Suspension of Injunction Pending Appeal in Coe v. Hookerr 406
F.Supp. 1072 (1976).
         He continued to use this inflammatory language of the anti-
choice movement. The following year, the New Hampshire House
voted to repeal the New Hampshire abortion law of 1848 as
obsolete and largely ineffective under Roe v. Wade. Attorney

                                                         8
                                     1009

General Souter was quick to point out that the 1848 state law was
not completely ineffective, as Roe v. Wade permits the states to
regulate abortions in the final trimester. Approximately .01% of
abortions are performed during this period, generally because of
severe fetal abnormalities discovered late in pregnancy. When
the measure to repeal the 1848 abortion law reached the state
Senate, attorney General Souter wrote a formal letter in
opposition. He explained in an interview with the Manchester
Union Leader May 27, 1877, that if the legislation passed, New
Hampshire "would become the abortion mill of the United States."

                                               CIVIL RIGHTS
         Through much of this century, the Supreme Court has played a
critical role in protecting and advancing civil rights and racial
equality. Nominees to the Supreme Court must share this basic
commitment to civil rights and equality. David Souter does not.
         The right to vote is the most fundamental of all fundamental
rights, and in 1970 Congress extended the ban on literacy tests
to every state in the Union. But New Hampshire defied the
federal law. When the United States filed suit to enforce it,
Souter argued that the Voting Rights law was unconstitutional.
Why? Because permitting illiterates to vote would "water down"
the votes of other citizens. A three-judge federal court firmly
rejected this argument. United States v. New Hampshire. (D.
N.H., Civil Action No. 3191, Oct. 27, 1970). All members of the
Supreme Court upheld this enactment in a related case because
"literacy tests unduly lend themselves to discriminatory
                                     1010

application, either conscious or unconscious." Oregon v.
Mitchell. 400 U.S. 112 (1970).

         New Hampshire, alone among the fifty states, again defied
the United States when the Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission sent a questionnaire requesting the racial, ethnic and
gender breakdown of its work force. Governor Thompson replied by
designating all state employees as "American." The United States
then filed suit to compel compliance with the federal law, and
Attorney General Souter argued that the required statistics would
lead to impermissible job quotas, and would promote
discrimination. The federal court flatly rejected these claims
because the statistic are "highly useful" in investigating
discrimination and the regulations were "clearly constitutional."
When Souter petitioned the Supreme Court to review his claim that
the federal requirement was "abusive" and "contrary to
constitutional principles," it was, ironically, Solicitor General
Robert Bork who successfully opposed the petition as totally
without merit. Memorandum for the United States in New Hampshire
v. United States, (filed Nov. 1976).

         A former Chair of the EEOC described Souter's claim as a
"fatuous argument raised by people who are fundamentally against
giving equal employment opportunity." Washington Post. Aug. 1,
1990, p. 4.

         In a commencement speech that year at the Daniel Webster
College, David Souter told his student audience that the
government should not be involved in affirmative action because

                                                        10
                                      1011

affirmative action is "affirmative discrimination." Manchester
Union Leader. May 31, 1976.

                                        OTHER FEDERAL POWERS
         Not only does David Souter challenge the authority of
Congress to protect minority voting rights and employment
opportunities, he also challenges the authority of Congress to
cope with other pressing needs of our times.
         In a 1978 speech to the Newport Chamber of Commerce Souter
warned against a strong central government and cited three
instances where the federal government exceeded its
constitutional authority: (i) the nationwide 55 mph speed law,
 (ii) unemployment benefits for state and local government
employees, and (iii) education for handicapped persons, Concord
Monitor. Dec. 29, 1983.
         The Constitution was established "to form a more perfect
union," and to this end it authorizes Congress to regulate
interstate commerce and to tax and spend for the general welfare.
It is far too late in the day to assert that Congress cannot
regulate gasoline consumption with a speed limit; that it cannot
regulate the minimum wages and fringe benefits paid employees;
and it was President Adams back in the 1820s who first proposed
federal aid to education.
         David Souter's concept of an impotent Congress may sit well
with a well-paid professional living a monastic life; but it
bodes ill for the rest of us.

                                      CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS

                                                        11
                                     1012

        The very first clause of the First Amendment provides that
"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
religion" or "prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Thomas
Jefferson wrote that this was intended to erect a "Wall of
separation between church and state." David Souter tried to
batter down that wall on three occasions.

         1. The Lord's Prayer case. In 1962 the Supreme Court
invalidated New York's "school prayer law" as a prohibited
Establishment of Religion. Engle v. Vitale. 370 U.S. 421. The
following year it invalidated the school prayer laws in
Pennsylvania, Abinoton School Dist. v. Schempp and in Maryland,
Murray v. Curlett. 374 U.S. 203 (1963). Non-the-less New
Hampshire continued to authorize each school district to require
"the recitation of the traditional Lord's prayer in public
elementary schools," along with the reminder that "this Lord's
prayer is the prayer our pilgrim fathers recited when they came
to this country in search of freedom."

         Suit was filed in 1976 to prohibit the school prayer. With
no regard at all for the earlier Supreme Court rulings Souter
stated his office would do "everything we can to uphold the law,"
Concord Monitor. Jan. 28, 1976 and he offered to file a brief in
support of the law. Manchester Union Leader. Feb. 7, 1976.
Needless to say, the federal court held that the New Hampshire
school prayer law was "patently and obviously unconstitutional."
Jacques v. Shawf Civil Action No. 76-26 (D.N.H.)

         2. The Good Friday Proclamation.

                                                        12
                                      1013

                 In 1977, as in previous years, Governor Meldrim
Thompson issued a Proclamation that "Good Friday represents a day
of solemn prayer and rededication" because of "the everlasting
debt we owe to our Creator." He appealed to citizens of New
Hampshire to "reverently observe Good Friday with due meditation
in church or chapel" and announced that "Flags would be flown at
half-mast" on our buildings "to memorialize the death of Christ
on the Cross on the first Good Friday."

         A number of ministers filed suit, alleging that the
Proclamation and flag-lowering violated the Establishment Clause.
The Federal court issued the requested injunction because the
Proclamation "not only seeks to advance religion, but a
particular religion."

         Attorney General David Souter appealed this decision by
trivializng the religiosity surrounding the Crucifiction of
Christ. He argued that Jesus Christ "although primarily a
religious figure may be respected and revered for secular
purposes as well;" further

         "The issuance of a proclamation and the neutral act of the
         symbolic lowering of a flag to commodate the death of an
         individual does not arises to the establishment of any
         religion." (emphasis added).
Needless to say, the Courts did not buy his argument that Good
Friday is not a religious occasion.
         Since his nomination, reports have surfaced suggesting that
Souter may have disagreed with Governor Thompson on the

                                                        13

Proclamation and lowering on the flag. Manchester Union Leader.
July 25, 1990. But the attorney who actually argued the case
reported that Souter "directed the effort" and his "advice and
counsel was important." Washington Times. July 26, 1990.

         3. Live Free or Die. The background of this case goes back
to 1943 when Jehovah Witnesses filed suit in West Virginia
protesting the requirement that their children salute the flag
each day in school. Their religious beliefs included a literal
version of Exodus 20:4 and 5 that "Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image ... thou shall not bow down thyself to them nor
serve them." To the plaintiffs, the flag was a "graven image"
and they refused to salute it.

         The Supreme Court agreed that the required flag salute
violated the Free Exercise of Religion. Justice Jackson wrote as
follows:

         "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
         constellation it is that no official, high or petty, can
         proscribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism,
         religion, or force citizens to confess by work or act their
         faith therein." Board of Education v. Barnette. 319 U.S.
         624 (1943).
         Some fifteen years later Mr. and Mrs. Maynard covered over
the state motto Live Free or Die on their license plate. They
did so out of a "deeply held personal religious conviction" that
"death is an unreality for a follower of Christ." They filed
suit in the federal court to enjoin the repeated criminal suits

                                                        14
                                     1015

against them for "Misuse of Plates."
        Once again David Souter ignored the Supreme Court precedent,

and defended the state law (as in the Good Friday case) by
trivializing the religious beliefs of the Maynards. He argued to
the Supreme Court that their conduct was "interpretable only as
whimsy or bizarre behavior" which fell "far short of First
Amendment protection." The Supreme Court, as expected, upheld
the right of the Maynards to "refuse to foster, in the way New
Hampshire commands, an idea they find morally objectionable."
Wooley v. Mavnard. 430 U.S. 705, 707 (1977).

         The only time David Souter has been sensitive to the
religious views of others was in the unlikely situation when the
federal government sued New Hampshire to compel compliance with a
federal regulation that the state fund the abortions of its
indigents. Souter objected because

         "May thousands of New Hampshire residents find the use of
         tax revenues to finance the killing of unborn children
         morally repugnant. These are deep, often religious beliefs,
         giving rise to strong emotion." Motion for Suspension of
         Injunction Pending Appeal in Coe v. Hooker. 406 F.Supp. 1072
         (1976).

                            A CARING, OR MEAN SPIRITED PERSON?
         Perhaps first and foremost, the quality we want most in a
Supreme Court justice is a respect and concern for human beings;
in short, a caring person. Here David Souter is lacking. A few
illustrations must suffice.

        Appeal of Bosselait. 547 A.2d 682 (N.H. 1988) concerned two
brothers, Albert and Edward. Well into their 70s, for a number
of years they had shared a janitor's job; each working four hours
a day. When the job was discontinued they applied for
Unemployment Compensation. Naturally, they did not retain a
lawyer. When told that New Hampshire law requires that those
seeking Unemployment Compensation must be "ready, willing and
able" to perform "full-time" work, they said they could not
accept new jobs calling for more than four hours of work each
day. Albert said he had a "weak back that goes out of joint when
least expected." Edward said he was limited by "partial eyesight
and angina." Edward added that "we don't dare to work more than
four hours a day at our age" and he was "not gonna play with his
health." When told again of the "full time" requirement Edward
responded that the statute is "discriminating against old fellas
... old people."

         Their claim for unemployment compensation was denied, and
with the aid of the legal clinic at the Franklin Pierce Law
Center they appealed. They argued that the "full time"
requirement, as applied to sick and elderly persons, violated the
 (i) federal Age Discrimination Act, the (ii) federal
Rehabilitation Act, and (iii) the constitutional guarantee of
equal protection.

         Judge Souter wrote the opinion denying their appeal. Why?
Because these issues had not been properly raised at the
Employment Compensation hearings. Souter wrote that "The record

                                                        16

below contains no reference to the Age Discrimination Act" and
although Edward Bosselait said the state law discriminated
against the elderly, "his remark could not reasonably have been
understood as initiating a statutory claim under federal law."
547 A.2d at 686. This is mean-spiritedness with a vengeance.

         David Souter was equally calloused in his consideration of
the rights of the mentally ill. See State v. Ballou. 481 A.2d
260 (N.H. 1984). Kevin Ballou pleaded not guilty to a minor
crime "by reason of insanity," and was committed to the New
Hampshire State Hospital. Under then existing law the commitment
was valid for two years only. At the end of that time the law
required that he be released unless the court was satisfied that
he still suffered from a mental disease. There after, the state
legislature extended the length of committal orders from two to
five years. Ballou now could be held for five years without
court consideration of his mental condition. The New Hampshire
Supreme Court held that this extension, as applied retroactively
to Ballou, violated the New Hampshire Constitution forbidding
retrospective or ex. post facto laws.

         Judge Souter dissented because Ballou had no "vested right
in the continuance of the earlier statutory provision regulating
the length of commitment." Consequently, adding the additional
three years between -Court examinations was not "punishment"
within the EX. Pact Facto provision. To borrow the words of the
majority opinion, this overlooks "the practical realities of the
institutional life of a mental patient."

        Finally, note must be made of Souter's harshness against the
Seabrook demonstrators. In the mid 1970s, construction of the
Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire became a major
controversy, and a rallying point for those who opposed nuclear
power. On the May Day weekend in 1977, thousand of people
gathered at Seabrook to protest the plant. They were orderly.
The protest was peaceful. The demonstrators trespassed on the
Seabrook property, but abided by a prior agreement not to enter a
4 0 acre section of the site where construction had already begun.

         Over 1400 protestors were arrested that day. Attorney
General Souter was in charge of the prosecution. He insisted on
a cash bail for everyone, because the protest was "one of the
most well-planned acts of criminal conduct in the state or the
nation." The state was required to house 1,400 detainees at
enormous cost, and it gratefully accepted a gift of $74,000 from
Seabrook to help finance the continuing prosecution and detention
of the protestors. Who was calling the shots?

         Trial began, and per agreement of the local district
attorney, the trial court gave the protesters suspended 15 day
sentences. When he heard of this, Souter rushed to the scene and
demanded that all protestors be give 15 days at hard labor, $200
fines and no suspensions: in short, the maximum penalty allowed
by law. He wanted the last ounce of flesh.

         Several weeks later Souter testified before the state
Finance Committee. In response to a question he said that if
there was a next time around, the state might use police dogs and

                                                                 18

fire hoses to keep demonstrators from the site. Manchester Union
Leader. June 3, 1977. Shades of Bull Connor and the Birmingham
civil rights demonstrations of the early 60s!!

                                     PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
         Those who support Souter defend his mean spirited acts and
attitudes on the theory that he was an attorney nearly doing the
bidding of his clients Governors Thompson and Sununu. But we are
all accountable for our acts. The "Good German" defense went out
with the World War II War Crimes trial in Neurenberg.
         True enough, some attorney, the so-called "hired guns,"
consider their law licenses as authority to advise clients on how
to skirt, avoid, postpone, or even disregard their legal
responsibilities. Most attorneys, fortunately, have a higher
sense of professional responsibility. They advise their clients
on how best to comply with the law. If the clients ignore their
advice, they dump them.
         At one time Governor Kerr Scott (later Senator Scott) was
warned that his stand on behalf of rural unfortunates might cause
political problems. He replied: "I don't have to be Governor of
North Carolina." Souter did not have to continue on as legal
advisor to Governors Thompson and Sununu. Attorney General
Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus
resigned their high posts rather then breach their faith and a
Justice Department regulation when ordered by President Nixon to
fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate
investigations. This is the manner of a man or woman we want on

our highest: court.
        When we call 'the roll of the Supreme Court: Holmes,

Brandeis, Hughes, Cardozo, Rutledge, Murphy, Black, Douglas,
Warren, Brennan; it easily appears that David Souter does not
belong in this company of high minded, high principled, justices.

                                           DAVIS HACKETT SOUTER
                                             September 21, 1990

Employment Law Center                 On September 6, the Alliance for Justice issued an analysis
Equal Rights Advocates        of Judge Souter's record, covering his tenure as state attorney
                              general and supreme court Justice. The report concluded that
         I Curran & Tousley   Judge Souter's record, and the absence of any vigorous defense of
                              individual rights during his entire legal career, pointed toward
National Education Associate  rejection. Accordingly, Judge Souter bore the burden of proving a
NOW Legal Defense and         commitment to the principles of equal justice. (A copy of the
                              Alliance report is attached and submitted for the record.)
National Women s Law Cenle
Native American Rights Fund           However, the Alliance withheld final judgmentt anticipating
Natural Resources Delense     that Judge Souter's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Comnittee
New ' ( Lawyers for the       would provide a clearer picture of his vision of the Constitution.
Public Inl                    In his seventeen hours at the witness table, Judge Souter failed
Public Advocates, Inc         to do so. He spoke volumes, but said little. Given numerous
Reno, Cavanaugh & Hornig      opportunities to explain his judicial philosophy, Judge Souter
Sierra Club Legal             provided responses that only raised more troubling questions.
Dele und                      Furthermore, he was neither forthcoming nor sufficiently specific
                              in his answers. Judge Souter's testimony consisted of vague
                              assurances, rather than a recognition of specific constitutional
                              principles.

                                      After carefully reviewing the hearing record, the Alliance is
                              convinced that Judge Souter will not protect the rights of those
                              suffering discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity,
                              religion, sexual orientation or literacy. Furthermore, his
                              responses concerning reproductive rights only intensify concerns
                              that he would overturn relevant precedents. This statement covers
                              the major reasons for rejecting this nominee.

                                      Voting Rights. Voting is one of our basic rights under the
                              Constitution. When asked about his defense of New Hampshire's
                              literacy test to qualify voters. Judge Souter stated that, as
                              assistant attorney general:

Women s Legal Oelense Fui
                                     1038

                  "It seemed to me at the time that a state which was acting
                  consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment -- and the State
                  was -- had done no wrong."

(Hearing Transcript, Sept. 14, 1990, at 194.) In fact, one of the
arguments in his brief was that voting by illiterate individuals
"diluted the votes of people who read."

         At the hearing, rather than retracting his statement, Judge Souter
off-handedly characterized this assertion as merely "a mathematical
statement." When asked to clarify, he repeated that it is "essentially
a kind of statement of math." (Sept. 14, 1990, at 195.)

         As an assistant attorney general, Judge Souter failed to understand
that the right to vote is not dependent upon one's education level and
that many citizens who are unable to read and write can still obtain
information and formulate intelligent opinions through television and
radio. Today, as a Supreme Court nominee, he continues to view the
issue abstractly, ignoring the historic use of literacy tests to deny
citizens the fundamental right to vote.

         Civil Rights. In regard to New Hampshire's refusal to provide a
racial breakdown of its state employees, as required by federal law,
Judge Souter defended the state's action on the grounds that New
Hampshire had no history of racial discrimination regarding its own
employees. (Sept. 13, 1990, at 146.) Later, Judge Souter stated it
even more broadly, that the "state of New Hampshire does not have racial
problems." (Sept. 13, 1990, at 198.)

         These statements show indifference to the existence of racial
prejudice that is no less present in New Hampshire than it is anywhere
else in the country. Numerous examples have been provided to the
Committee. Moreover, his refusal to provide the statistical breakdown
indicates a critical lack of understanding about the methods for
detecting discrimination, namely, the collection of statistical data.
It also suggests a potential hostility toward legislative attempts to
overturn the Rehnquist Court majority decision in Wards Cove Packing
Company, which imposed greater burdens of proof on Title VII plaintiffs
bringing discrimination suits based on statistics.

         Affirmative Action Speech. During the hearings, Judge Souter
did not disavow his 1976 speech as attorney general in which he
criticized affirmative action as "affirmative discrimination". He told
the Committee:

                  "...I hope that was not the exact quote because I don't
                  believe that. The kind of discrimination that I was talking
                  about in that speech was discrimination, as I described it and
                  I recall being quoted in the paper about it, a discrimination
                  in the sense that benefits were to be distributed according to
                  some formula of racial distribution, having nothing to do with
                  any remedial purpose but simply for the sake of reflecting a
                  racial distribution."

(Sept. 14, 1990, at 111.) Several facts are apparent from this and
later testimony. First, Judge Souter admits to having read the article
covering his speech because he "recalled being quoted in the paper." He
also attempts now to confine his criticism solely to racial quotas
(though he painstakingly avoids using the phrase). However, during the
last 14 years, he made no request for a retraction or clarification of
the statement. David Souter made that speech as the state's chief
lawyer and should have been aware of the seriousness and weight that his
remarks carried.

        Gender Discrimination. Several times during the hearings, Judge
Souter criticized the "heightened" or "middle tier" scrutiny standard as
"too loose" and as granting "an enormous amount of leeway to the
discretion of the court". (September 13, at 156.) His statements
mirror Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the landmark case of Craig v.
Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), that the heightened scrutiny standard is
"diaphanous and elastic as to invite subjective judicial preferences."
However, Judge Souter failed to note that this firmly established
standard for reviewing sex-based classifications has been highly
effective in battling discrimination against women.

        When asked for examples demonstrating the "looseness" of'the
heightened scrutiny standard -- an alleged flaw that he repeatedly
raised -- Judge Souter offered two cases, neither of which, however,
involved the use of mid-level scrutiny for gender discrimination.
 (Sept. 17, 1990, at 55-57.) The first, Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia
253 U.S. 415 (1920), concerned an economic regulation, not a sex-based
classification. The second, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), although
involving gender discrimination, was decided prior to Craig v. Boren,
that is, before the establishment of the heightened scrutiny standard
for gender cases and when the weaker, rational basis test was the law.
His answer simply skirted the issue.

         In light of several briefs and one judicial opinion in which Judge
Souter called into question the heightened scrutiny standard, his
comments about tightening the standard might give the hopeful impression
 that he believes sex discrimination deserves greater scrutiny than that
provided by the current standard. However, noticeably absent in his
testimony is a straightforward assurance that gender discrimination
deserves at least heightened scrutiny. His exchange with Chairman Biden
is illustrative:

                 "The Chairman. So there should be a middle level to define it
                 more clearly?"

                 "Judge Souter. There has got to be something other than just
                 threshold level scrutiny."

 (Sept. 13, 1990, at 160.) Furthermore, Judge Souter shunned numerous
opportunities to articulate a better approach to sex discrimination
cases. (Sept. 13, 1990, at 160 and 217; Sept. 17, 1990, at 57.)
Rather than providing a clearer picture of the principles he would use
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
nominee instead cast doubt on the security of the constitutional
protections that have already been won for millions of women.

        Right of Privacy. Throughout the hearings, Judge Souter treated
all questions involving the right of privacy, and consequently, the
right to choose abortion, as if it were a game of chess, rather than a
discussion involving fundamental rights that could determine the course
of women's lives. Judge Souter refused to acknowledge a fundamental
right of privacy beyond that accorded to a married couple (Sept. 13,
1990, at 113.) He did acknowledge that "if we are going to have any
core concept of marital privacy, [procreation] would certainly have to
rank at its fundamental heart." (Sept. 13, 1990, at 116.) However, he
refused to state whether the marital right to privacy includes the right
to use contraception -- the holding 25 years ago in Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) -- and to terminate a pregnancy within
or outside of a marriage. (Sept. 13, 1990, at 112.)

        Judge Souter's refusal to answer nearly all questions regarding the
right of privacy, on the basis that the constitutional principles
underlying Griswold and Roe are unsettled law, is inconsistent with his
answers to other questions. For example, he discussed the Lemon v.
Kurtzman test for reviewing Establishment Clause cases, which recently
have been decided along 5-4 lines. Judge Souter also discussed with
some degree of detail Justice O'Connor's views on applying the Lemon
test. In addition, he even told the Committee how he would approach
cases under the Free Exercise of Religion Clause, another area of close
division among the Justices. Moreover, Judge Souter willingly discussed
his moral views on the death penalty and sentencing for white collar
crimes, but he refused to do so in regard to abortion. This double
standard for answering questions and lack of candor is unacceptable and
should be grounds for rejection.

        The single instance Judge Souter could recall to show his "equality
of empathy" on the abortion issue occurred 24 years ago. However, this
account has no connection to his judicial philosophy. The experience
does not allay concerns about his later actions as attorney general,
when he adopted the inflammatory language of the anti-choice movement to
oppose the repeal of New Hampshire's criminal abortion statute and
government funding of abortions for indigent women. And, as a state
judge, he empathized only with the dilemma of anti-choice judges and
physicians who might be obligated to participate in a woman's decision
to terminate her pregnancy.

        Along the same lines, Judge Souter, when asked by Senator Leahy
about "the practical consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade," turned
the issue into an abstract question, replying that "the issue would
become a matter for legislative judgment in every state" and the "issue
of federalism would be a complicated issue." (Sept. 17, 1990, at 113.)

        Seabrook. Senator Leahy questioned Judge Souter about the unusual
action taken by the state government to raise money in May 1977 from the
owner of Seabrook and others to finance the prosecution of protestors
opposed to the nuclear power facility. Judge Souter acknowledged that
these fundraising actions were improper, particularly the $74,000
contribution secured from the Seabrook owners.

        However, Judge Souter's statements concerning his knowledge of the
details in these solicitations remain murky. He claimed to know nothing
about these activities until June 30, 1977, even though his deputy was
informed about the fundraising appeals two months earlier. Given that
the Manchester Union-Leader broke the story on May 15 and that the
events surrounding the protestors at Seabrook and fundraising actions
were highly visible in the press, Judge Souter's "lack of knowledge" is
implausible.

        Conclusion. Judge Souter's dodging of key constitutional
principles is unacceptable from a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.
While he acknowledged in his opening statement that his decisions will
affect the lives of millions of people, he is unwilling to tell the
American people where he stands on the issues. Judge Souter has failed
to meet the burden of proving that he is forward-looking and that he has
the open-mindedness needed so critically to bring balance to the Court.
We urge the Committee to reject this nominee.

INTRODUCTION

         The Alliance for Justice is a national association of civil rights,
environmental, and consumer public interest law organizations. Its work
includes promoting reform of the legal system to ensure equal access to
the courts and encouraging the expansion of public interest
representation. In addition, the Alliance works to preserve the
integrity of the federal judiciary through the appointment of eminently
qualified men and women who are committed to upholding the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.

         This report analyzes Judge David Souter's opinions, writings and
actions in light of his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose
function is the vindication of individual and constitutional rights.
The evaluation is a daunting one because the nominee's legal record is
so sparse. As a New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice from 1983 until
1990, he wrote more than 200 opinions. Of these, only a few involve
federal constitutional and statutory issues. The only other source of
legal writings are the briefs he filed as Attorney General, a position
he held from 1976 to 1978.

         The underlying theme throughout David Souter's legal opinions and
briefs is a constrained view of the role of the courts as the ultimate
protectors of the disadvantaged and of unpopular minority groups against
government coercion. During his tenure on the state Supreme Court,
Judge Souter restrictively interpreted the New Hampshire Constitution, a
document more protective of civil and individual rights than the federal
Constitution. There is substantial reason to believe that he will limit
federal constitutional guarantees in the same way.

         In gathering information about David Souter's judicial philosophy,
what is striking is an absence of any vigorous defense of individual
rights or constitutional law. He has not, in any forum, spoken on any
issue of law or philosophy. During the twenty-two years he spent as a
public official, he neither gave speeches nor wrote legal articles.
David Souter has failed to test his own thoughts on the great issues
that he will undoubtedly face if he sits on the high court. For the
U.S. Supreme Court and from David Souter, the country deserves more.

         The Senate faces the responsibility of filling out the sketchy
record on which David Souter can be judged. As an equal partner in the
judicial appointment process, senators have the obligation to examine
candidates on the full range of considerations on which the president
has nominated them. Because of the closely divided U.S. Supreme Court,
the Senate and the public need to understand where Judge Souter stands
on the issues of privacy, civil rights, the role of the judiciary, as
well as a range of other constitutional issues.

         In recent years, the Senate has established the standard that a
nominee's view of the Constitution and of the Supreme Court are key
inquiries in the confirmation process. A president may choose someone
who shares his views and values. However, he should not seek judges who
show undue deference to majority rule over individual rights. Only
after the Senate is fully satisfied that it has a substantial knowledge
                                     1045

of David Souter and is assured that he understands the role of the
courts in affording citizens the full protection of the Constitution,
can they assess the wisdom of this nomination and cast their vote
knowledgeably.

         It is incumbent on Judge Souter to meet the burden of proof that he
is qualified for the post. If he answers senators' questions with vague
assurances and generalities on key issues such as abortion and civil
rights, then the Senate ought to be skeptical. If his answers leave the
impression that Judge Souter would weaken civil and constitutional
rights, the Senate should withhold consent.

JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

         The judicial philosophy of Judge Souter raises critical questions
about his theory of the role of the courts and his respect for the
rights of individuals. His judicial opinions reveal a limited view of
the judiciary's core function to protect individuals from overreaching
by the state. In his Supreme Court questionnaire response on the role
of the courts, Judge Souter is completely silent about safeguarding
individual rights. Instead, he states that the "expansively phrased
provisions of the Constitution must be read in light of its division of
power among the branches of government and the constituents of the
federal system." Thus, given an opportunity to expound upon the virtues
of the Constitution, Judge Souter looks at the charter as merely a
blueprint for power and omits any reference to the Bill of Rights.

Restrictive View of the State Constitution

         Judge Souter has consistently refused to advance individual rights
under the New Hampshire Constitution. Before his appointment to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court, that court was developing a considerable body
of law under the state Constitution, which often provided greater
protections for individual than those secured under the federal
constitution. This movement was reflected in State v. LaFrance, 471
A.2d 340 (1983), in which the court stated:

                  "[0]ur voters and founding fathers intended to create a
                  government which would be checked by a higher law. That
                  higher law is our state constitution."

                  "The courts have a duty to interpret constitutional
                  provisions. This duty may result in decisions that run
                  counter to the present desires of the voters or their elected
                  representatives. This is so because the constitutions of our
                  states and nation are intended to be restraining documents so
                  that the exercise of power by the majority does not go
                  unchecked. We do not have unqualified majority rule; we have
                  majority rule with protection for minority and individual
                  rights. Without this limitation we would have tyranny of the
                  majority and we would lose our liberty."

To further the development of state constitutional law, in State v.
Ball, 471 A.2d 347 (N.H. 1983), the court held that when claims of
violations of the federal and state constitutions are presented, the
court should address the state claims first before treating the federal
issues. From 1983 to 1985, Judge Souter joined the court in broadly
interpreting the state Constitution. However, he expressed reluctance
to rely on the New Hampshire Constitution as an independent source of
rights in his concurrence in State v. Kellenbeck, 474 A.2d 1388 (N.H.
1984): "I would concentrate on the development of State constitutional
law in those cases when a State rule would be different from its federal
counterpart and would affect the outcome."
                                     1047

         Then, in 1985, Judge Souter began placing restrictions on Ball.
In State v. Cimino, 493 A.2d 1197 (N.H. 1985), he warned litigants that
they must clearly state independent grounds for a state claim if they
are to be allowed to take advantage of Ball. By 1986, Judge Souter
urged even greater limitations on Ball when he dissented from the
court's consideration of a state constitutional claim on grounds that it
was not "clearly" preserved for appeal. State v. Bradberry, 522 A.2d
1380 (N.H. 1986). He argued that the state issue had been inadequately
presented, even though the claimant had specifically asked the trial
court to rule on the issue and had raised it on appeal in the brief with
citation to the specific constitutional provision. Subsequently, with a
change in the court's membership due partly to then-Governor John
Sununu's appointments, Judge Souter prevailed in blocking expansion of
the state Constitution and in imposing stringent technical barriers on
litigants seeking to press state constitutional claims. Overall, he has
consistently refused to advance individual rights under the New
Hampshire Constitution beyond those afforded under the federal
Constitution.

Illustrative Cases

         For example, given the opportunity to establish greater protections
under the state constitutional guarantee of equal protection, Judge
Souter declined. In State v. DeFlorio, 512 A.2d 1133 (N.H. 1986), a
sixteen-year-old was convicted as an adult of misdemeanor traffic
offenses -- driving without a license and operating a vehicle "in
disobedience to a police officer" -- and sentenced to four consecutive
weekends in the county jail, which lacked segregated facilities for
juveniles. Because of his age, the county jail staff refused to admit
him. On appeal, the county and the teenager argued that the statute
requiring his being tried as an adult was unconstitutional on federal
and state equal protection grounds. The defendant asserted that the
court should apply "heightened scrutiny" to the statutory classification
based on age, which requires the government to show that the age-based
distinctions "serve important governmental objectives that are
substantially related to achieving those objections." Craig v. Boren,
429 U.S. 190 (1976)

         Judge Souter, writing for the court, rejected his argument and
applied the less protective "rational basis test", which is used to
review age-based discrimination under the federal equal protection
clause. The rational basis test gives great deference to discrimination
and requires only that the law be reasonable. By adopting this test as
"the appropriate one to apply in assessing both the State and the
federal claim," Judge Souter equated the two equal protection guarantees
and completely ignored his statement in Kellenbeck that state
constitutional standards should differ from their federal counterparts.

         In cases involving criminal procedure, Judge Souter has shown an
even greater willingness to defer to the state at the expense of
individual rights. In State v. Koppel, 499 A.2d 977 (N.H. 1985), Judge
Souter dissented from the majority holding that police roadblocks used
to detect and arrest drunk drivers were unconstitutional under the New
Hampshire Constitution, part 1, article 19, giving every citizen "a
                                      1048

David Souter Report
Page - 5 -

right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his
person, his house, his papers, and all his possessions." Although
similar to the federal Fourth Amendment, the New Hampshire court has
recognized article 19 as providing "greater protection for individual
rights." In his dissent, Judge Souter argued that the court was
extending protections beyond prior cases and that the state's interest
in roadblocks outweighed the "burden upon individual drivers." The
Rehnquist Supreme Court has since adopted Judge Souter's views on the
constitutionality of roadblocks. Michigan v. Sitz, 58 U.S.L.W. 4781
 (1990).

         However, Judge Souter's deference to police actions eventually
prevailed. In writing for the majority in State v. Valenzuela, 536 A.2d
1252 (N.H. 1987), he held that the use of a pen register to record and
disclose numbers dialed from an individual's telephone was not a
"search" under article 19. Judge Souter was untroubled by the state
police's foregoing use of a New Hampshire wiretapping law requiring
judicial approval of telephonic intercepts, limited to a ten-day period,
and instead asking federal agents to obtain a thirty-day period pen
register authorization from federal court. The dissent noted that since
the development of the case, the legislature had amended the wiretapping
statute "to provide further protection for the citizens of this State in
the maintenance of the 'proper balance between the State's duty to
protect the public and the individual's right to privacy and free
expression.'...[The legislature] has undertaken to preserve what it
perceives as an expectation of privacy in an area where the plurality
concludes that there is no such expectation."

         Judge Souter also found no difficulty in weakening constitutional
protections for individuals against retrospective or ex post facto laws.
In State v. Ballou, 481 A.2d 260 (N.H. 1984), the defendant pled not
guilty by reason of insanity and was subsequently committed to the state
hospital. Under the law, his mental condition was due for reexamination
in two years. However, during the intervening period, the legislature
extended the validity of committal orders from two to five years, but
also increased the state's burden of proof at recommittal hearings from
mere preponderance of the evidence to that of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. The patient could seek review of his or her commitment prior to
the expiration of the five-year period, but then the burden of proving
sanity and non-dangerousness (by preponderance of the evidence) shifted
to the patient. According to the majority in Ballou, the operation of
the amendments so disadvantaged the patient, that they violated the
state constitutional prohibition against retrospective laws "which
changes the punishment, and inflicts greater punishment, than the law
annexed to the crime when committed."

         However, in dissent, Judge Souter concluded that this prohibition
was completely inapplicable, stating that "[ojnly proof of dangerousness
can justify commitment, and a commitment on grounds of dangerousness is
not punishment" within the scope of the constitutional prohibition. He
conspicuously omitted any discussion of the shifting burdens of proof.

         Two years later, though, Judge Souter successfully narrowed the
scope of the ex post facto prohibition. In State v. Heath, 523 A.2d 82
                                     1049

David Souter Report
Page - 6 -

(N.H. 1986), the legislature had restricted the statutory right to take
discovery depositions in cases involving child victims. Because the
statutory amendments came after the date of the alleged offense, the
defendant claimed that application of the restrictions to his case
constituted an ex post facto law. The ex post facto prohibition
includes any law which "alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives
less or different testimony, than the law required at the time of the
commission of the [offense]." Writing for the court, Judge Souter
disagreed, stating that "the change in the law of entitlement to
depositions does not fall within any of the ex post facto categories."

         The extraordinarily heavy burden that Judge Souter demands of those
seeking relief from the courts is vividly demonstrated in Appeal of
Bosselait, 547 A.2d 682 (N.H. 1988), a case involving both
constitutional and statutory issues. In Bosselait, two brothers, ages
76 and 79, shared a janitorial job, with each working four hours a day.
When their employer laid them off, the brothers sought unemployment
benefits but were rejected. The Department of Employment appeal
tribunal noted that the benefits statute required applicants to be
"available for and seeking permanent, full-time work." Although the
Bosselaits complained that they suffered health problems precluding
full-time employment and that the statute "is discriminating against old
fellas...old people," the appeals tribunal rejected their claims.

         Judge Souter dismissed the plaintiffs' claims of violations under
the state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection, the
federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the federal
Rehabilitation Act. Despite the plaintiffs' statements before the
appeals tribunal (where they appeared without counsel), he stated that
"[n]ot one of these issues...has been both timely raised below and
preserved for consideration on appeal." Although finding the record
inadequate to preserve the issues, Judge Souter proceeded, in lengthy
dicta, to discuss and reject each claim.

         In the context of involuntary civil commitment, Judge Souter showed
similar hostility to state constitutional claims. In In re Sanborn, 545
A.2d 726 (N.H. 1988), he refused to address a mentally retarded
individual's claims under state constitutional law that evidence
obtained through police questioning should be suppressed in his
commitment hearing. Judge Souter stated that the patient's "pleadings
and brief have not crossed the line dividing passing references to State
issues from analysis calling for adjudication on independent state
constitutional grounds."

         Judge Souter's imposition of stringent technical barriers to
raising state claims and his refusal to recognize claims under the New
Hampshire Constitution have resulted in a backsliding of state
constitutional law. His harshly restrictive, mechanistic approach to
the state Constitution raises questions that bear directly on his views
of the role of the courts and how he will interpret the federal
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

Doctrine of Original Intent

         Another aspect of Judge Souter's judicial approach is his adherence
to the "original intent" theory of constitutional interpretation.
Endorsed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, Judge Robert Bork, and
Justice Antonin Scalia, the theory holds that a judge's role in
interpreting ambiguous, open-ended constitutional language is simply to
divine the intent of the framers through textual and historical
analysis.

         Judge Souter's most explicit application of the original intent
doctrine can be found in In re Estate of Dionne, 518 A.2d 178 (N.H.
1986). In Dionne, the majority held that a state law requiring parties
to pay a fee to the probate court for holding a hearing on days not set
by statute was invalid under the state Constitution, part I, article 14,
which provides that "[e]very subject of this state is entitled...to
obtain rights and justice freely, without being obliged to purchase
it..." According to the majority, compensating probate judges (who
adjudicate wills and involuntary commitments) for special hearings
"smacks of the purchase of justice." Although the arrangement had been
in existence for almost one hundred years, the court stated that "[i]n
an era of heightened sensitivity to appearances of impropriety, the
spectacle of a citizen or attorney giving cash in one hand and receiving
a judicial hearing and decision in the other is one that can no longer
be tolerated."

         Judge Souter dissented, urging obedience to the "court's clear rule
that 'the language of the Constitution is to be understood in the sense
in which it was used at the time of its adoption.'" He stated that the
"court's interpretive task is...to determine the meaning of the article
14 language as it was understood when the framers proposed it and the
people ratified it as part of the original constitutional text that took
effect in June 1784." Judge Souter proceeded to trace the historical
derivation of the constitutional provision from the Magna Carta of 1215
and recounted the statutory practice of compensating judges, dating back
to American colonial days. He concluded by stating:

                  "Since the adoption of that article f14] was not followed by
                  any known challenge to the statutory provision for fees to
                  compensate probate judges, the most reasonable inference is
                  that the constitutionalists of that time did not understand
                  the fee provision to be a forbidden obligation to purchase
                  justice."

         Judge Souter's heavy reliance on what the framers intended in the
late 1700s reveals a fundamental and troubling aspect in his judicial
philosophy. His dissent ignored what the majority recognized -- that
standards of justice have evolved over the last two hundred years and
that paying a fee to the judge (not the court clerk) to hear one's case
raises questions about the judge's impartiality.

         Furthermore, Judge Souter's failure to consider changing and modern
circumstances is aptly illustrated by the very cases cited for support
in his Dionne dissent. He cited an 1860 advisory opinion on proposed
                                      1051

David Souter Report
Page - 8 -

legislation reducing the number of jurors from twelve to six, and
claimed that the court had "confirmed the vitality of the [original
intent] rule as recently as 1981," in another advisory opinion on nearly
identical legislation. However, Judge Souter neglected to mention that
the 1981 opinion was based not only on the 1860 opinion but also on
empirical studies of the last twenty years using social science data on
the use of six-person juries and the possibly greater risk of erroneous
convictions.

         In a recent interview with The Massachusetts Lawyer, Judge Souter
failed to adequately explain this dissent in Dionne:

                  "On constitutional matters, I am of the interpretivist school.
                  We're not looking for the original application, we're looking
                  for meaning here. That's a very different thing."

While the Dionne dissent alone is not conclusive proof that Judge Souter
subscribes to the theory of original intent, he has said nothing to
dispel this impression. Because original intent analysis can be used to
roll back the progress of the last forty years in constitutional rights,
Judge Souter's views must be fully explored.

ROLE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

         In addition to his opinions on the state Supreme Court, David
Souter's briefs and actions as state attorney general, from 1976 to
1978, provide further insight in his legal views. These raise questions
about whether he viewed his role as advocate for the public interest or
as the lawyer for the governor who appointed him; whether and to what
degree he adopted the legal positions he defended; and what his current
view is of the arguments he advanced.

Institutional Independence

         Several institutional checks guarantee the independence of the
attorney general in New Hampshire. Because the attorney general's term
of four years -- five years during David Souter's tenure -- extends
beyond the governor's two-year term, he is not forced to adopt the
governor's positions in order to maintain his appointment, and he is
shielded to some degree from the political posturing that may occur with
biennial gubernatorial elections. Second, under the laws of New
Hampshire, the governor is provided his own legal counsel -- separate
from the attorney general -- who serves at the governor's pleasure.
RSA 4:12. And third, any attempt by the governor to remove the attorney
general from office is appealable to the state Supreme Court. RSA 4:1.

         In Opinion of the Justices, 259 A.2d 660 (N.H. 1969), the court
noted that the attorney general "has sole responsibility of formulating
his legal opinion." Furthermore, any order by the governor, under RSA
7:9, to the attorney general to represent the state's interest in any
case must be "reasonable and practicable". Opinion of the Justices, 175
A.2d 396 (N.H. 1961).

Personal Independence and Standards

         David Souter sought to establish his independence early in his
tenure. In an interview prior to his January 1976 confirmation, he
stated that not only is the attorney general the "chief law enforcement
officer" and "civil law officer for state government", but he is also
"counsel to the public". (Manchester Union-Leader, Dec. 28, 1975) Only
a few weeks later, he declared:

                  "At no time would I give testimony with which I disagree. And
                  it would be irresponsible for the attorney general to support
                  any state agency if he felt what they were doing was clearly
                  wrong." (Concord Monitor, Jan. 7, 1976)

However, Attorney General Souter also stated that "he will represent an
agency in an already-completed action, or in ongoing actions on which
the law is open to interpretation." In a 1978 letter, shortly before he
left office, Mr. Souter further described his standard:

                  "My standard...has been simply this: this office will
                  represent any governor in a proceeding brought against him in
                  his official capacity whenever his action cannot reasonably be
                  judged patently illegal or unconstitutional. If, as I

                  believe, the Attorney General should act as a lawyer guided by
                  generally applicable principles, I don't believe any other
                  standard is possible. The alternatives seem to me to be an
                  Attorney General who is a political rubber stamp or one who is
                  a political spokesman for political opposition to the
                  Governor. I find each such alternative unacceptable."

Letter to Robert A. Backus, Esq., March 30, 1978.

Conflicts with the Governor

         Gambling Legislation

         David SouterVs first clashed openly with New Hampshire Governor
Meldrim Thomson, who appointed him, in 1976, when he successfully
blocked legislation permitting sports card betting and jai alai. He
testified that "illicit operations would flourish" and "people who were
not bettors before could have latent gambling interests stimulated to
the point where they would eventually be giving money over to criminal
operations." (Manchester Union-Leader, April 7, 1976)

         The following year, when similar legislation was proposed to
authorize casino gambling and slot machines, Mr. Souter again objected.
He stated that it would invite organized crime to launder money in the
state, and that it "is not really a call to increase our tourism" but
instead an attempt to "exchange our present vacationers for a different
sort of traveler." (Concord Monitor, Jan. 28, 1977) Governor Thomson
supported the bills "wholeheartedly" and stated that he was "very much
appalled" by the scare tactics used by the opponents. (Concord Monitor,
April 7, 1977)

         Seabrook Licensing

         Governor Thomson and Attorney General Souter took opposite
positions again on an issue that usually found them in complete
agreement -- the Seabrook nuclear power plant. In July 1976, Mr. Souter
 filed legal objections to the federal government's licensing of the
plant, claiming that the company had underestimated the number of people
who would be affected by a nuclear accident, and that plant construction
 could not be conditioned on the Environmental Protection Agency's
approval of the plant's cooling system.

         Governor Thomson said that he "was deeply disturbed" by Mr.
 Souter's actions "especially since the law did not compel him to take
 such action." He further stated that the "Attorney General discussed
with me his plan to make the appeal. The matter is entirely in his
hands under the statutes and out of control of the governor." But the
 governor also stated that he might have his own legal counsel enter the
 case. (Manchester Union-Leader, July 18, 1976)

         When criticized for objecting to the construction, Mr. Souter
 stated, "I see the attorney general's office as the counsel for the
 public, and it has been our job to make sure we worked within the rules
 as laid down by law." (Manchester Union-Leader, July 20, 1976) The
                                      1054

David Souter Report
Page -11-

attorney general also stated that his appeal was not intended to halt or
delay construction of the plant, but only to ensure its safety.

         Despite these disagreements, David Souter supported the governor's
positions on such issues as lowering the flag on state buildings on Good
Friday to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ and refusing to comply
with federal fair employment reporting regulations (New Hampshire was
the only state in the Union to refuse). A former attorney of Mr.
Souter1s staff recalled that at his own farewell dinner, Mr. Souter
publicly thanked the governor for never asking him to take a position
that he thought was inappropriate.

Responsibility and Supervision

         As a state official, David Souter held responsibility for any
briefs or letters that went out under his name. In one of his early
interviews as attorney general, David Souter stated his intention to
keep his office small to maintain "a tightly-knit, tightly-run
organization." One former staff member, Richard Wiebusch, a senior
attorney who handled a case opposing Medicaid funding for abortions,
recently told a reporter that Mr. Souter "had no time to look at most of
the documents his staff wrote." (Concord Monitor, Aug. 8, 1990)
However, several attorneys serving under Mr. Souter contradicted that
statement, saying that the attorney general reviewed most documents
filed under his name, such as opinion letters and briefs, though the
degree of review varied according to individual. Regardless of the
degree of his supervision, David Souter was constitutionally entrusted
with carrying out and defending the legal positions of the state.

PRIVACY

         David Souter's opinions, writings and public remarks in the area of
privacy, coupled with his adherence to the doctrine of "original
intent", raise serious questions over whether he will uphold this
fundamental right.

The Right to Choose Abortion

         Although Judge Souter grudgingly recognizes the Court's Roe v. Wade
holding, his focus has never been on a woman exercising her constitu-
tional right. Nor has he shown any measure of solicitude for the
difficult decision she faces. Instead, as attorney general, David
Souter has sought to block government funding for abortions and to
retain restrictions on them. In addition, he has expressed sympathy for
anti-choice doctors and judges who eschew any involvement in helping
women exercise their right. Perhaps most significantly, in discussing
abortion, David Souter has used the language of the anti-choice
movement, including "abortion mill," "killing the unborn," and "the
destruction of fetuses." The only known occasion in which he did not
take a restrictive position is when the board of trustees of the Concord
Hospital voted soon after Roe v. Wade to allow abortions to be performed
at the hospital. Those present do not recall Judge Souter, a member of
the board, commenting on the policy.

         The Smith v. Cote Concurrence

         As a state Supreme Court justice, David Souter concurred in a
decision involving a woman's right to sue her doctor for failing to
discuss the abortion option. In Smith v. Cote, 513 A.2d 341 (1986), a
mother who had contracted measles during her pregnancy sued her doctor
after the baby was born with birth defects. She asserted that the
doctor was obligated to inform her of the possibility of birth defects
and discuss with her the option to terminate the pregnancy. Recognizing
a cause of action for wrongful birth, the New Hampshire Supreme Court
held that doctors have a duty to test for birth defects, inform pregnant
women of the results, and discuss the option of abortion.

         In his concurrence, Judge Souter reached out to resolve an issue
not before the court concerning the dilemma faced by doctors who are
opposed to abortion and yet must discharge their professional
obligation. He offered an alternative for such doctors, by allowing
them to make timely referrals to other physicians "who are not so
constrained." The majority believed it unnecessary to address the issue
raised in Judge Souter's concurrence because it had not been briefed or
argued in the court below.

         Letter Lobbying Against Judicial Involvement

         In 1981, Judge Souter expressed the same concern for anti-choice
judges. As a superior court judge, David Souter wrote to a state
legislator concerning proposed legislation that would have required
either parental or judicial consent before an abortion could be
performed on an unmarried minor. Speaking on behalf of the New
                                      1056

David Souter Report
Page -13-

Hampshire Superior Court in his role as chair of the court's legislation
committee, Judge Souter urged deletion of the judicial consent
provision, because it left to judges a "fundamental moral decision about
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the
individual judges." Judge Souter raised the issue that some judges who
"believe abortion...is morally wrong... could not in conscience issue an
order requiring an abortion to be performed." He further wrote that he
believed the legislation would result in "shopping for judges who would
entertain such cases."

         Contrary to David Souter's position, judges have a legal obligation
-- just as doctors have a professional obligation -- to apply the law to
issues regardless of their personal beliefs. Judges frequently make
moral decisions, most visibly in death penalty cases. Judge Souter's
empathy with anti-choice judges suggests not only a restrictive view on
the role of the courts in protecting individual rights and applying
constitutional standards, but also his strong distaste for abortion. In
addition, though the letter was instrumental in preventing passage of
the bill, Judge Souter took no position on whether young women should be
required to obtain parental consent -- leaving open the question of
whether he would vote with some of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices to
permit states to require parental consent or notification without the
opportunity for teenagers to obtain judicial relief.

         Opposition to Repeal of Abortion Statute

         As attorney general in 1977, David Souter successfully opposed the
repeal of an 1848 law which applied criminal penalties for the
performance of an abortion. To support his argument, David Souter
evoked the symbol of New Hampshire becoming the abortion capital of the
country. He is quoted as saying, "Quite apart from the fact that I
don't think unlimited abortions ought to be allowed...I presume we would
become the abortion mill of the United States." He further
hypothesized, "Let's say somebody performed an abortion, which would now
be legal in New Hampshire.·.in the eighth month. Let's assume you had a
viable fetus. If that fetus died as a result of the abortion, that
would not be murder or manslaughter. That would be no offense at all
the way I read the statute."

         Apparently, Mr. Souter was concerned that repeal would leave the
state without any prohibition against abortions, when in fact the
abortion statute was (and is) completely unenforceable under Roe.
Moreover, Roe has always allowed state-imposed restrictions after
viability, contrary to Mr. Souter's assertions. These gratuitous,
inflammatory comments reveal a hostility to the fundamental right to
choose.

         Medicaid Funding of Abortion

         Also, while David Souter was state attorney general, his office
filed a brief opposing Medicaid funding of abortion for poor women.
According to the brief, "it is equally clear that Congress did not enact
Title XIX to aid in the destruction of fetuses." Moreover, the state
was justified in prohibiting the funding of elective abortion except
                                     1057

David Souter Report
Page -14-

when the life or health of the mother is in danger because "thousands of
New Hampshire citizens possess the very strongly-held and deep-seated
moral belief that abortion is the killing of unborn children." The
state lost at the district court level, but an identical case before the
U.S. Supreme Court approved the funding prohibition.

Rape Shield Cases

         Similar to the rape shield laws enacted by forty-six states and the
U.S. Congress, New Hampshire's statute is essentially a codification of
the right to privacy for rape victims and is intended to encourage them
to come forward to testify. The law provides that "[p]rior consensual
sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the actor
[defendant] shall not be admitted into evidence." Before Judge Souter's
appointment to the state supreme court, in State v. Howard, 426 A.2d 457
(N.H. 1981), the court held that the rape shield law must yield to some
degree to the defendant's constitutional right to cross-examination, and
allow him an opportunity, out of the jury's presence, to show that the
value of evidence of prior consensual sexual activity outweighs its
prejudicial effect on the victim.

         In State v. Colbath, 540 A.2d 1212 (N.H. 1988), Judge Souter
reversed the trial court's exclusion of evidence of prior consensual
sexual activity, stating that the rape shield law could not bar
testimony of the rape victim "hanging all over everyone and making out
with [the defendant] and a few others" in the hours preceding the
incident. In this case, for example, "the jury could have taken
evidence of the complainant's openly sexually provocative behavior
toward a group of men as evidence of her probable attitude toward an
individual within the group." He further suggested that the victim may
have alleged rape to "excuse her undignified predicament". The court
concluded that the evidence related directly to the accused's defense of
consent. However, on retrial, the defendant was convicted again. In
State v. Baker, 508 A.2d 1059 (N.H. 1986), Judge Souter and the court
reversed the conviction of a defendant for felonious sexual assault on
the grounds that the defense counsel had not been given an opportunity
to demonstrate that the rape shield law did not apply to testimony about
the victim's prior consensual activity.

         Judge Souter simply refused to recognize the importance of the rape
shield law. Although the New Hampshire legislature clearly meant to
ensure the victim's privacy rights, Judge Souter showed little deference
to the lawmakers' intentions. In addition to ignoring the intent of the
legislature, his approach echoes the harmful, stereotypical notions of
"she asked for it" and "she made it up". Interestingly, his decision
for the convicted rapist in Colbath is one of the few in his judicial
career in which he ruled in favor of the defendant. In nearly all of
his criminal cases, he upheld convictions and took a narrow view of
constitutional protection for the accused.

Rights of Gays and Lesbians

         In Opinion of the Justices, 530 A.2d 21 (1987), the Supreme Court
rendered an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of state
                                     1058

David Souter Report
Page -15-

legislation prohibiting gays from adopting children, becoming foster
parents, and running day care centers. The court relied heavily on
Bowers v. Hardwick, 106 S.Ct. 2841 (1986), which held that homosexuals
do not have a federal constitutional right of privacy. Judge Souter and
three other Justices accepted without any critical evaluation and
despite contrary evidence presented, the legislative assumptions that
"the provision of a healthy environment [for children] should exclude
homosexuals...from participating in governmentally sanctioned programs
of adoption, foster care, and day care" because "being a child in such
programs is difficult enough without the added social and psychological
complexities that a homosexual lifestyle could produce."

         Applying the weakest scrutiny possible -- the rational basis test
-- the court advised that the ban on adoption and foster parenting was
constitutional. However, the court concluded that prohibiting gays from
running day care centers was constitutionally infirm, on the basis that
day care providers, unlike adoptive and foster parents, are not primary
role models.

         In a stinging dissent, Justice Batchelder rejected the use of
sexual orientation as a factor in evaluating potential adoptive or
foster parents. He writes, "[t]he State is never more humanitarian than
when it acts to protect the health of its children. The State is never
less humanitarian than when it denies public benefits to groups of
citizens because of ancient prejudices against that group."

THE FIRST AMENDMENT

         As reflected in the briefs filed as attorney general, David Souter
views the protections of the First Amendment narrowly. In his positions
on this subject, Mr. Souter has deferred to state action promoting the
establishment of Christianity and interfering with the free exercise of
religion, without requiring a compelling justification.

Separation of Church and State

         Lowering the Flag on Good Friday

         David Souter defended the state's ability to infringe upon First
Amendment rights in his support for Governor Meldrim Thomson's order
that flags on state buildings be flown at half-staff on Good Friday of
1978. The governor had ordered the flag-lowering to "memorialize the
death of Christ on the first Good Friday" and called for meditation or
prayer. Several clergymen filed suit, claiming that the order offended
the First Amendment religion clauses.

         Attorney General Souter supported the flag lowering, stating that
it was "a religiously neutral symbol of respect for an individual"
within the state's discretion. Lowering the flags, he claimed, had a
secular purpose in that it recognized Good Friday as an occasion to
commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. Failing to recognize the
religious significance attached to Jesus Christ and inherent in the
observance of Good Friday, Mr. Souter contended that the order did not
advance or inhibit religion:

                  "The lowering of the flag to commemorate the death of Christ
                  no more establishes a religious position on the part of the
                  State or promotes a religion than the lowering of a flag for
                  the death of Hubert Humphrey promotes the cause of the
                  Democratic Party in New Hampshire."

         A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, noting that
the governor's order contained "all the seeds of divisiveness that the
establishment provision was designed to prevent. It not only seeks to
advance religion, but a particular religion." The First Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed, but Justice William Brennan, as Justice for the
First Circuit, issued a temporary stay on the appeals court decision,
thus reinstating the district judge's order.

         In this instance, Judge Souter was not simply acting at the behest
of Meldrim Thomson, but on the belief that the flag order was lawful.
In his own words, David Souter applied a straightforward standard "...in
flag cases and any others....[that] this office will represent any
governor in a proceeding brought against him in his official capacity
whenever his action cannot reasonably be judged patently illegal or
unconstitutional." It is reasonable to conclude that David Souter saw
no constitutional problem with the flag order.

         Displaying State Motto on License Plates

         Similarly, in Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977), two Jehovah's
Witnesses challenged the constitutionality of a New Hampshire state law
which required the display of the state motto, "Live Free or Die", on
license plates. Objecting to the motto on religious grounds, Maynard
covered over and cut out portions of the motto on his license plates and
was convicted for violating state law. The case eventually reached the
U.S. Supreme Court.

         The attorney general's office, under David Souter, defended the
constitutionality of the statute. He argued that important government
interests were furthered by the establishment of an efficient motor
vehicle registration system and promotion of tourism and state pride.
The attorney general's office also argued that obscuring the motto bore
"no relationship to the freedom of expression of the [Maynards]" and did
not amount to symbolic speech worthy of First Amendment protection. Mr.
Souter did not believe that the message conveyed by obscuring the state
motto was sufficiently "particularized" to constitute symbolic speech.
He characterized Maynard's conduct as "pure whimsy" without further
explanation.

         In an opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger for a seven-member
majority, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed. While not passing on the
"symbolic speech" issue, the Court found that the state could not compel
an individual to display an ideological message on his private property
for viewing by the public. The First Amendment, the Court held,
protects the rights of individuals to refuse to foster an idea they find
morally objectionable. Contrary to Mr. Souter's views, the Court also
held that the state's interest was not sufficiently compelling to
justify required display of the state motto on their license plates.

         The Burger Court, unlike Mr. Souter, clearly found that the state
interest in identifying passenger vehicles could have been achieved
through less drastic means that did not impinge so broadly on First
Amendment rights. Furthermore, the state's interest in promoting
tourism and state pride through display of the motto did not outweigh an
individual's right not to be forced to carry such messages.

Political Dissent

         David Souter's involvement in the controversy surrounding the
Seabrook nuclear power plant displays an unduly harsh treatment of
political dissenters. As a state official representing the public
interest, David Souter himself questioned the granting of the license to
construct the power plant. However, Mr. Souter did not approve of civil
disobedience regarding citizen opposition to the plant.

         In 1976, Attorney General Souter questioned the safety precautions
laid down by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board before issuing the
permit to the Seabrook plant. (Manchester Union-Leader, July 20, 1976)
For raising these issues, Mr. Souter incurred the wrath of the
Union-Leader, and "deeply disturbed" Governor Thomson, who claimed that
his action would "comfort" opponents to the nuclear plant. (Associated
                                     1061

David Souter Report
Page -18-

Press, July 19, 1976.) Later, however, Mr. Souter assured the governor
that he did not care to be allied with either side. "[The Attorney
General's] office never has, is not now and is not likely in the future
to take a position adverse to the building of the plant as such. In
particular, at this stage of the game, we're not trying to stop
construction." (Manchester Union-Leader, December 1976)

         Meanwhile, the Attorney General's office prosecuted ten of two
hundred protesters involved in an August 1976 demonstration at the
plant. For violating an injunction against entry at the plant site, the
Attorney General's office successfully sought unusually severe sentences
of six month's jail time (with three months suspended) for the
demons trators.

         Less than one year later, in May 1977, the Clamshell Alliance, a
New England-wide anti-nuclear group, organized a second demonstration,
which was described as "the first large-scale show of civil disobedience
in the nation in opposition to construction of a nuclear power plant."
(Facts on File, May 28, 1977) More than 1,400 protesters were arrested
and held in the National Guard Armory.

         The trial court gave the first demonstrator on trial a suspended
sentence of fifteen days at hard labor and an order to pay a $100 fine.
Vehemently objecting, David Souter made an extraordinary, personal
appearance in trial court and asked that the sentences not be suspended,
"The imposition of a 15-day suspended sentence is for all practical
purposes the imposition of nothing." Concord Monitor, May 6, 1977. He
described the demonstration as "one of the most well-plannned acts of
criminal activity" in the nation's history and stated that the police
had overheard citizens band radio messages indicating that the
demonstrators planned to reoccupy the construction site. Concord
Monitor, May 7, 1977.

         Mr. Souter then had to account for the financial costs for
quashing the protest. The state Senate Finance Committee questioned the
wisdom of his decision to incarcerate 1,400 demonstrators for almost two
weeks at the cost of $50,000 per day. He defended his actions as
necessary to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system, and
that the demonstrators had the attitude that "the state of New Hampshire
is not going to do one damned thing to us." (Associated Press, June 3,
1977) Although admitting that incarceration was unusual for criminal
trespass, Mr. Souter told the committee that he thought it necessary to
clear away the protesters to avoid confrontation with the construction
workers, who were scheduled to begin working the next day. The state
also had to pay a National Guard bill of more than $500,000.
(Associated Press, June 22, 1977)

         With the responsibility for Seabrook prosecution costs squarely on
his shoulders, David Souter faced the governor's Commission on Crime and
Delinquency to request an additional $150,000 to defray the bill. When
the Commission questioned his use of funds, Mr. Souter threatened to
have the Commission disbanded if they did not appropriate the funds,
according to one Commission member. The attorney general's office
                                     1062

David Souter Report
Page -19-

accepted $74,000 from the power plant owners to defray the state's
prosecution costs. (Manchester Union-Leader, May 15, 1977)

         As the chief law enforcement officer in the state and with ultimate
responsibility for all criminal prosecutions, David Souter shaped the
course of the criminal proceedings in the Seabrook demonstration. The
severity of the measures which he applied to the demonstrators reveals
an intolerance of political dissent.

Gag Order on State Employees

         An obtuse statement by David Souter in connection with one of
Governor Thompson's controversial policies should give free speech
advocates concern.

         At Governor Meldrim Thomson's urging, the Executive Council adopted
a resolution supporting nuclear power as the official state policy of
New Hampshire. The resolution was in response to mounting criticism
from legislators and state officials for the nuclear power plant that
was to be built at Seabrook. Essentially, the resolution sought to
prevent state employees from speaking against nuclear power in any
official capacity. (New Hampshire Times, March 17, 1976)

         "If someone wants to oppose the nuclear power plant, he has an easy
way out. He can resign and then speak out against it," declared
Governor Thomson. When critics charged the governor with imposing a gag
rule, he quickly retreated, "State employees have always been free to
speak out on any issue as private citizens....If any state employee were
called before a regulatory board or court to give testimony on a subject
with which he had special competence, he or she would be expected to
respond regardless of the direction of the testimony." (Manchester
Union-Leader, March 6, 1976)

         Attorney General Souter's comment on the governor's resolution was
noncommital: "No state employee, whose job it is to make sure that
environmental protection safeguards are obeyed, should feel intimidated
by the new policy." Mr. Souter failed to assure employees that their
jobs would be protected if they openly disagreed with Thomson's policy.
Looked at another way, his statement could be interpreted as
trivializing the employees' free speech rights.

Public Right to Know

         David Souter's narrow interpretation of the state's Right-to-Know
law, when New Hampshire was coping with mounting criticism of the state
prison, suggests a position which, at best, is vague and noncommittal.
At worst, it is evidence of a belief that the state has the right to
deny information to the public.

         In July 1976, Governor Thomson announced that the Executive Council
and the state prison board would be holding a "closed-door" session to
discuss problems at the prison. Attorney General Souter defended the
private meeting under an exception in the state's Right-to-Know Law
permitting executive sessions if matters .to be discussed "would be
                                     1063

David Souter Report
Page -20-

likely to adversely affect the reputation of any person other than a
member of the body itself." Mr. Souter promised reporters he would
advise the governor to open the meeting if discussion drifted to
criticizing Prison Warden Helgemoe's administration. (Concord Monitor,
July 1, 1976)

         The Concord Monitor criticized this attempt to evade the
Right-to-Know law. According to the newspaper, Governor Thomson
"already has so sullied Warden Helgemoe's reputation that little could
be said in a public session to damage it further...The closing of the
joint meeting was a sham, a cover-up and an evasion of the law. The
public was denied its right to know the truth about the prison."
(Concord Monitor, July 2, 1976)

         Recognizing that the "reputation" exception could be used to
exclude the public from almost any discussion, Attorney General Souter
admitted that "it could be stretched so far as to swallow the law
entirely." But then Mr. Souter declared that the Right-to-Know Law as a
whole "stinks" because it is a piece of "vague and lousy legislative
drafting."

Judicial Opinions

         As a Justice on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, David Souter has
written several opinions on freedom of expression, but they shed little
light into his philosophy of the First Amendment. In State v. Hodgkiss,
565 A.2d 1059 (N.H. 1989), Judge Souter upheld a law banning the posting
of signs on city property, but struck down another which prohibited
encumbrances on sidewalks that prevented an individual from distributing
literature and urging passers-by to vote for a candidate. In Petition
of Chapman, 509 A.2d 753 (N.H. 1986), Judge Souter and the majority
struck a compromise between the New Hampshire bar association and
several member attorneys claiming that the association's lobbying
against tort reform legislation violated their free speech rights. The
court concluded that the bar association could lobby on legislative
measures regarding the administration of justice, but not on proposed
changes in substantive law, such as the creation or repeal of causes of
action. In In re New Hampshire Disabilities Rights Center, 541 A.2d 208
(1988), Judge Souter invalidated a state law provision prohibiting
non-profit corporations from providing services to non-indigent clients.
He agreed that operation of the law violated an organization's rights of
association and advocacy under the federal constitution.

         Finally, as a trial judge on the New Hampshire Superior Court, in
the 1981 case of State v. Siel, Judge Souter quashed subpoenas of two
student reporters whose notes were sought by the defendant in a murder
trial. Their newspaper article alluded to the victim's involvement in a
local drug trafficking ring, which was a key factor at trial.

CIVIL RIGHTS

         As attorney general, David Souter openly refused to comply with
federal civil rights laws. He strongly attacked affirmative action and
characterized attempts to implement programs to monitor discrimination
as gratuitous and based on questionable intent. Furthermore, his narrow
view of civil rights raises questions about whether he believes that the
bedrock principles of the Forteenth Amendment include women as a
protected class.

Affirmative Action

         In a 1976 speech as attorney general, David Souter attacked federal
affirmative action guidelines, calling them "affirmative discrimina-
tion." He said that the federal government should not be involved in
establishing rules requiring employers to give preference to particular
ethnic or racial groups. Mr. Souter said that such policies make people
eligible for some service solely by virtue of ethnic background. He
stated his belief that the protection of civil liberties should be
accomplished through the restraint of power, as supported by "our
Constitutional history". (The Manchester Union-Leader, May 31, 1976)

         Mr. Souter used the same reasoning when, as attorney general, his
office defended New Hampshire's refusal to report the racial composition
of the state's workforce, as required by federal fair employment laws.
In the state's brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Souter
challenged the constitutionality of the reporting requirement, calling
it "superfluous" and "abusive." He claimed that the requirement
"proceeds from the cynical assumption that the fairest employer cannot
be trusted any more than the most biased. And, it ends in treating
every employer as if he were a suspected bigot and lawbreaker." He
stated the regulation was non-essential to the aims of Title VII and a
intrusive and unnecessary exercise of governmental power. Brief for
Appellant in United States v. New Hampshire, No. 76-1018 (1st Cir. filed
Feb. 20, 1976).

         Mr. Souter contended that requiring state employers to make racial
and ethnic classifications was itself an illegal state action in
violation of the equal protection clause. Such requirements were to be
tolerated no more than racial quotas, which were impermissible in his
view. Mr. Souter further argued that the reporting requirements would
cause employers to think in terms of color, rather than merit, and
thereby result in employers acting in terms of color. He assumed this
result, even though the reporting was to be done on an aggregate, not an
individual, basis. The First Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his
arguments, United States v. New Hampshire, 539 F.2d 277 (1st Cir. 1976),
and the Supreme Court denied his request for review.

State Literacy Test

         The 1965 Voting Rights Act amendments are pivotal in this country's
commitment to the protection of minority rights. In 1970, David Souter
sought New Hampshire's exemption from adhering to them. In United
States v. New Hampshire, Civ. No. 3191 (D. N.H. 1970), the Nixon Justice
                                     1065

David Souter Report
Page -22-

Department filed an action, declaring that the amendments to the 1965
Voting Rights Act invalidated provisions in the New Hampshire
constitution which prescribed a literacy test as a qualification to
vote. As assistant attorney general, Mr. Souter defended the literacy
test. He unsuccessfully argued that a suspension of the tests under the
1965 amendments exceeded Congress's authority, because the tests had
been previously administered in compliance with federal law.

         David Souter is obviously untroubled by the position he was asked
to defend. Twenty years later, in his questionnaire to the Senate
Judiciary Committee, he described this case as one of the ten most
significant that he argued. However, given the opportunity to explain
his position, he does not reflect on the substance of the case or on how
the Voting Rights amendments have affected minority citizens. Instead,
Mr. Souter could only recall the intellectual exchange of his oral
argument.

Equal Protection

         David Souter's views on the scope of equal protection regarding
sex-based classifications are evidenced in a brief filed by the New
Hampshire Attorney General's office in an appeal of a statutory rape
case, Meloon v. Helgemoe, No. 77-1197 (D. N.H. April 27, 1977). Mr.
Souter opposed a federal order holding that New Hampshire's statutory
rape law was unconstitutional, because it punished only men who had
sexual intercourse with underage females and not women who had
intercourse with underage males. Mr. Souter disagreed in an extremely
paternalistic manner.

         He contended that any claim of sex discrimination was to be
analyzed under the rational basis test, dismissing the "heightened
scrutiny" standard for gender-based classifications that the U.S.
Supreme Court had firmly adopted the year before in Craig v. Boren, 429
U.S. 71 (1976). The Craig test requires that a classification "must
serve important government objectives and must be substantially related
to the achievement of those objectives." Mr. Souter insisted that this
language was merely an outgrowth of the rational basis test, contrary to
mainstream legal thought concerning equal protection standards.

Sex Discrimination

         Further evidence of Mr. Souter's restrictive interpretation of law
is apparent in the civil rights case of King v. New Hampshire Department
of Resources and Economic Development, 420 F.Supp. 1317 (D. N.H. 1976).
The Attorney General's office under David Souter argued that the
plaintiff had failed to prove that sex discrimination had occurred.

         The female plaintiff had been refused summer employment with a
beach meter patrol for three consecutive summers. In one job interview
she was asked whether she could wield a sledgehammer, whether she had
any construction industry experience, and whether she could "run someone
in." Despite the fact that these duties admittedly constituted "less
than one percent" of the duties of the job, the attorney general's
office contended that such questions were job-related and did not
                                     1066

David Souter Report
Page -23-

evidence any "discriminatory animus" toward the female applicant. Such
 questions, the office concluded, were not unlawful even if they resulted
 in a refusal to hire the plaintiff. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the argument and upheld the district court's findings that such
questions evidenced a discriminatory state of mind on the part of the
 interviewer.

         David Souter's office also contended that the plaintiff needed to
 show that the job was offered to male applicants with similar
qualifications in order to make out a prima facie case of sex dis-
 crimination. However, the appeals court found that a prima facie case
of sex discrimination was made and the burden was on the state to
provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's
rejection.

         Finally, the attorney general also contended that the district
court had imposed an unreasonable burden on employers to check with
every past employer reference of a female applicant. Such a requirement
was described as "reverse discrimination", placing an onerous burden on
small employers. The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that an
employer cannot use an isolated, negative reference as a pretext for not
hiring an applicant, and such a negative reference was insufficient to
overcome the showing of discriminatory animus has been made.

CONCLUSION

         This report identifies the issues which require full exploration by
the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, the Senate cannot be content
with simple explanations of these issues. Mr. Souter's statements must
be measured by the historic purpose served by the Supreme Court, which
is to uphold the guarantees contained in the Bill of Rights.

         The Alliance calls on the Senate to fill in the blanks and to show
that Mr. Souter's appointment would serve the interest of the Court and
of the country. The Senate must require that David Souter show an
appreciation and recognition of the great strides made toward advancing
social justice.

         David Souter must assure the Senate and the public that he has an
open mind, is forward- looking, and has a vision of the Constitution
which respects individual rights. If he fails to meet this burden, the
Senate should withhold its consent.

                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

         When he nominated U.S. Circuit Judge David H. Souter to be an associate justice
of the U.S. Supreme Court, President George Bush said that his nominee would "interpret"
the law rather than "legislate from the bench." In doing so, President Bush was not
distinguishing between different forms or styles of judging; he was distinguishing judging
from something else altogether.

         In our constitutional system of limited republican government, the judiciary is as
much governed by the rule of law as the executive and legislative branches. An
independent judiciary, set apart from politics institutionally and in approach to its task, is
essential to safeguard liberty. The very act of judging itself is defined by application of the
law rather than the preferences of the judge, no matter where that process may lead.

         Since the nomination, attention has been almost exclusively focused on a single issue
about which we know virtually nothing: abortion. Judge Souter's record as a justice on the
New Hampshire Supreme Court, however, is a rich source of insight and information about
his judicial philosophy. That record paints a consistent picture of a conservative jurist
passionately devoted to the rule of law and properly conducting the act of judging.

        A careful jurist, Judge Souter takes a narrow view of the role of the judge. He
respects precedent, strives to decide cases based on the facts without reaching unnecessary
issues and without announcing rules broader than necessary to the task before him, and
consistently applies traditional rules ofjurisdiction, statutory construction, and constitutional
interpretation.

        Judge Souter is eminently qualified to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. His judicial
philosophy is exactly as President Bush described it: interpreting, not legislating. He is a
judge, after all, not a politician.

         In fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent, the U.S. Senate in 1987
shifted radically from examining qualifications to checking out a nominee's politics, from
conducting a searching inquiry into judicial philosophy to narrowly testing how a nominee
would vote once on the bench. This is not only a dangerous aberration from traditional
practice, it directly threatens the independence of the judiciary and literally demands that
a nominee bias himself in public on issues that may well come before him as a judge.

         In 1987, the Senate seemed to say that a "paper trail" was a liability. At least the
most liberal members of that chamber are today seeming to say that the lack of a "paper
trail" is a liability. Those liberals condemn attempts to regulate the Court's appellate
jurisdiction in areas like abortion as "political tampering" but today feel free to impose their
own political litmus test upon nominees to the bench in areas like abortion. This is
hypocrisy, nothing more and nothing less.

         The Senate should aggressively conduct a properly focused investigation of this
superb nominee and consent unanimously to his appointment before the Court's October
1990 Term begins.

                                     DAVID H. SOUTER:
                            THE DEFINITION OF JUDGING

         On July 23, 1990, President George Bush exercised his power under Article II,
Section 21 of the United States Constitution and formally nominated U.S. Circuit Judge
David H. Souter to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

         This analysis is intended to assist the U.S. Senate in fulfilling its constitutional
"advice and consent" role in considering Judge Souter's nomination.2

                                     JUDGE SOUTER'S RESUME

         David Hackett Souter was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, on September 17, 1939.
He received his B.A. magna cum laude from Harvard in 1961 and continued his education
as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, England. A member of Phi Beta Kappa, he
received his law degree from Harvard in 1966 and joined the Concord, New Hampshire, law
firm of Orr & Reno.

         After just two years of legal practice, David Souter entered public service. He served
as Assistant Attorney General from 1968 to 1971, Deputy Attorney General under then-
Attorney General Warren Rudman until 1976, and Attorney General until 1978. Moving
to the judicial branch, he served as an associate justice of the New Hampshire Superior
Court for five years and, by appointment of then-Governor John Sununu, an associate
justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court from 1983 to 1990. President Bush
nominated Justice Souter to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
in February 1990.3 The American Bar Association rated him "well qualified" for this post
and the U.S. Senate unanimously consented to his appointment. He began service on May
25, 1990.4

               Article II, Section 2 states in part that the President "shall nominate, and by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, shall appoint...all other Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law."

        Judge Souter is a member of the New Hampshire and American Bar Associations,
a member of the board of trustees of Concord Hospital from 1973 to 1985 (president, 1978-
1984), a member of the board of overseers of Dartmouth Medical School from 1981 to
1987, and a member of the New Hampshire Historical Society (trustee, 1976-1985; vice
president, 1980-1985). His service on legal and judicial committees has included the New
Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council, the Governor's Commission on Crime
and Delinquency, and the New Hampshire Bar Association Committee to Recommend
Codification of Rules of Criminal Procedure.

                                    SOURCES OF INFORMATION

        Information about David Souter and his views derives from several sources.
Determining the information's significance, however, requires attention to the particular
source. State attorneys general, for example, may file briefs and make arguments which
reflect the views of their governor-client rather than their own. Opinions by a five-member
court, especially in cases involving sensitive or controversial issues, rarely indicate exactly
the views of individual members of the court and never reveal the negotiating, coalition-
building, agreements, or concessions that took place during the process of producing a
majority opinion. Advisory opinions, frequently given by state courts but never by federal
courts, are entirely abstract and can differ substantially from opinions in actual cases
following the identification of concrete issues, filing of legal briefs, trials or appellate
argument, etc. Votes, as well as lines of reasoning or analytical approaches, are always the
product of an actual case. Each case, of course, is unique.

                                     JUDGE SOUTER'S RECORD
                              WHAT WE DONT KNOW: ABORTION

        Perhaps the most contentious single issue surrounding the Souter nomination is one
on which virtually nothing concrete exists: abortion. Pro-life and pro-abortion activists
agree that this nomination will at least affect the Court's abortion jurisprudence.

         In 1973, the Court voted 7-2 in Roe v. Wade5 to create a virtually unlimited right to
abortion. The dissenters, William Rehnquist and Byron White, remain on the Court. In
1975, John Paul Stevens replaced William Douglas, leaving the balance essentially intact.
In 1981, Sandra Day O'Connor replaced Potter Stewart. Stewart had voted with the Roe
majority; O'Connor has made it clear that she at least opposes Roe," though has not
indicated she would flatly overrule the decision. In 1986, Antonin Scalia replaced William

           5 410 U.S. 113 (1973).

           6 In Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416 (1983), Justice O'Connor harshly
criticized the Roe trimester framework as "unworkable" and "on a collision course with itself."
                                      1071

Rehnquist when President Ronald Reagan elevated Rehnquist to Chief Justice; Scalia is
clearly a vote to overrule Roe. In 1987, Anthony Kennedy replaced Lewis Powell. Powell
supported Roe, writing the 1983 Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health7 decision
reaffirming it. Kennedy is generally viewed as a vote to overrule Roe. Therefore, the pro-
Roe majority has shrunk from 7-2 in 1973, to 6-3 in 1986, to 5-4 today.

        David Souter has never presided over an abortion case, never written judicial
opinions or scholarly articles on the subject, never spoken his mind about it. As such,
activists on both sides can only look at the slim bits of his record that bear even tangentially
on the subject. They reveal nothing of substance about those views. In the interest of a
thorough and balanced evaluation of this nomination, those bits of information are listed
here.

        * "Abortion opponents attacked Souter for serving on the boards of two New
           Hampshire medical facilities where abortions are performed.1"

         * The Manchester Union Leader reported that, while state attorney general, Souter
           opposed a bill which included provisions repealing the state's strict anti-abortion
           law. He stated: "Quite apart from the fact that I don't think unlimited abortions
           ought to be allowed, if the state of New Hampshire left the situation as it is now,
           I presume we would become the abortion mill of the United States."9 The article
           pointed out that Souter was representing Meldrim Thomson, New Hampshire's
           strongly pro-life governor, and that his remarks did not necessarily reflect his own
           views.

         * In 1981, a pro-abortion member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives
           requested an opinion from the Superior Court about a pending bill requiring
           parental consent for abortions on minors but authorizing a "judicial bypass" of the
           parents' wishes. Justice Souter wrote a letter on behalf of the court to the
           relevant committee chairman recommending that the legislature "not authorize the
           exercise of judicial choice by justices of the Superior Court to determine whether
           an abortion should be performed upon a pregnant, immature minor whose parents
           do not consent to that course of action."

                  * The letter expressed no opinion about parental consent: "The judges do not
                    believe it is appropriate for the court to take a position on the basic
                    question addressed by the bill, whether parental consent should be required
                    before an abortion may be performed upon an unmarried minor."

                  * The letter addressed only the "judicial bypass" provision, allowing a judge
                    to authorize an abortion for an immature minor which would be in her
                    "best interests."

                  * The letter objected to the judicial bypass provision because it required
                    making "fundamental moral decisions about the interests of other people
                    without any standards to guide the individual judge." The individual judge's
                    "predilections" rather than articulated "rules and stated norms" would result
                    in judges engaging in inappropriate "acts of unfettered personal choice."

                  * The letter objected to the judicial bypass provision because of the
                    "necessarily moral character" of the decision judges would have to make
                    and the "resulting disparity of responses." In sum, "a principled and
                    consistent application of the quoted provision would be impossible."

                  * One journalist concluded: "While the 1981 letter may have been useful to
                    abortion-rights supporters [in defeating the proposed legislation], it also
                    reflected a view of the role of judges that is in line with the philosophy
                    espoused by Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan."10 The bottom line
                    is that this letter said nothing about Roe v. Wade, nothing about parental
                    consent, and nothing about abortion.

        · A state regulation prohibited the use of Medicaid funds to pay for elective
           abortions. A U.S. district court permanently enjoined this regulation and the state
           appealed. The brief on the merits, dated March 10, 1976, was filed with the U.S.
           Court of Appeals for the First Circuit under Attorney General Souter's name by
           the briefs author, Assistant Attorney General Richard Wiebusch. The following
           statement appears on page 41 of the brief: "Plaintiffs cannot in good faith dispute
           that thousands of New Hampshire citizens possess a very strongly held and deep-
           seated moral belief that abortion is the killing of unborn children." Wiebusch also
           wrote and filed, under Souter's name, a separate memorandum supporting the
           state's motion for suspension of the injunction pending appeal. The following
           statement appears on page 6: "Many thousands of New Hampshire residents find
           the use of tax revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally
           repugnant." Wiebusch has told reporters that Souter had "nothing to do with this

        * In Smith v. Cote," Justice Souter joined an opinion in which the New Hampshire
           Supreme Court13 recognized for the first time a cause of action for "wrongful
           birth."14 The court stated that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade
           "is controlling"15 and felt the issue before it was "whether, given the existence of
           the right of choice recognized in Roe, our common law should allow the
           development of a duty to exercise care in providing information that bears on that
           choice."16 Justice Souter concurred specially to address a significant issue not
           specifically raised by the questions of law transferred by the superior court. He
           raised the hypothetical of the pro-life physician and wrote that "I do not understand
           the court to hold...that some or all physicians must make a choice between
           rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving their profession in order
           to escape malpractice exposure."17 Clearly, whatever one's evaluation of the court's
           legal analysis concerning the relevance of Roe, the court assumed that decision's
           relevance without any comment as to its validity.

        That's all there is on the issue. The bottom line is that we do not have any clear
and specific evidence of Judge Souter's personal or judicial position on abortion or the
validity of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. As with so many other issues and
so many other nominees, we must use intuition and judgment based on what we do know
about this nominee and his judicial philosophy.

from the superior court.

             In such a case, a woman sues her doctor for failing to inform her of facts that might prompt her to
choose abortion, thus rendering the birth a legal "wrong" for which she claims compensation.

                             WHAT WE DO KNOW: THE "GRAB BAG"

         While virtually nothing is known about Judge Souter's specific personal or judicial
views on abortion, a significant body of judicial decisions exists covering a wide range of
issues. Focusing, as the media and most activists have, exclusively on the unknown ignores
the known and the consistent picture it paints of the "conservative mindset" of this "careful
jurist."1'

         "During his seven years on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, David Hackett
Souter wrote more than 200 opinions reflecting the grab bag of issues that are the staple
of state supreme courts-focused more often on mundane and technical legal issues than
questions of sweeping constitutional magnitude."19 The Washington Post compared Judge
Souter's record on the New Hampshire Supreme Court with retired Justice William
Brennan's record on the New Jersey Supreme Court.20 Justice Souter authored 217 opinions
including 187 majorities, 13 concurrences, and 17 dissents. Justice Brennan authored 232
opinions including 210 majorities, four concurrences, and 18 dissents.

         Three of Justice Souter's 187 majority opinions were appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. The Court refused to review any of them.21 Of his 187 majority opinions, 179
(95.7%) were for a unanimous court and eight (4.3%) were for a divided court. "Divided"
means any decision attracting a separate, even a concurring, opinion by another Justice.
Justice Batchelder, known as the most liberal member of the bench at that time, wrote a
separate opinion in seven of these eight cases.

         As state attorney general, David Souter filed petitions for review by the U.S.
Supreme Court in three cases. The Court refused to review any of them.22

         While on the New Hampshire Superior Court trial bench, Justice Souter took an
opportunity in 1981 to describe his views on criminal sentencing. In the context of
sentencing a man convicted of negligent homicide in the deaths of three teenagers while
driving drunk, Justice Souter said in part:

        / want to speak explicitly on something which I think about and which the
         counsel for the defendant quite rightly said I should think about, and that is the
        purposes of sentencing.

         To start off with, one of them is the perception in the world around us that the
        defendant has been justly dealt with in relation to what he did. There should be
        a proportion observed in sentencing, and trivial cases should not be dealt with
         with severity. And flagrant cases should not be dealt with leniently.

        Secondly, one considers the effect usually referred to as the reformative effect
        likely on the defendant from the sentence....! don't believe that very many
        sentences on many-very many-criminals are likely to have much reformative
        effect after thefirstoffense.... [I]f the defendant does not receive a heavy sentence,
        one may reasonably guarantee that it's not going to have any reformative effect.

        [The tjhird consideration is deterrence...~And [the] fourth consideration is public
        protection. I don't know whether this defendant's alcoholism is ever going to be
        controlled But I think the circumstances justify trying to protect the public from
        the effects of that alcoholism for about as long as it is possible."

        Judge Souter*s "record" is comprised almost entirely of his actions while in public
service in New Hampshire. The most substantive portion of this record is found in the
body of opinions he authored while an associate justice on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court. This section will explore opinions by Justice Souter drawn from the following
categories:

         In each of these substantive areas, Justice Souter evidenced a consistent commitment
to apply the law, stick close to the facts, and avoid imposing his own preferences or notions
of good social policy. He did not stretch settled rules to achieve specific outcomes. He did
not redefine settled terms to "bring them up to date." He regularly deferred to legislative
enactments within the constraints imposed by common law and constitutional mandates.
His record is described by President Bush's repeated phrase: Justice Souter interpreted the
law, he did not legislate from the bench.

         This analysis is necessarily selective in terms of both its categories and cases. It
includes areas raising issues of wide interest and likely relevance to issues Justice Souter
might confront on the U.S. Supreme Court. It avoids, for example, the substantial number
of zoning and insurance cases the state high court regularly addressed. It does address
various constitutional issues. Conclusions reached here as to Judge Souter's judicial
philosophy would not be appreciably altered by a searching examination of other
substantive areas of case law.

        A. Evidence. Two cases demonstrate how Justice Souter carefully applied New
Hampshire's "rape shield law."24 In doing so, he demonstrated his commitment to
maintaining the due process rights of criminal defendants rather than imposing his personal
feelings about some abstract sense of "justice." The Supreme Court of New Hampshire had
held that a rape defendant must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the evidence's
probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect."

         In State v. Colbath" Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, reversed a
conviction for aggravated felonious sexual assault and remanded for a new trial. The trial
judge had instructed the jury that evidence of the complainant's sexually provocative
behavior in a bar with men other than the defendant within hours of the incident was
irrelevant. Justice Souter wrote that in this case, "the jury could have taken evidence of the
complainant's openly sexually provocative behavior toward a group of men as evidence of
her probable attitude toward an individual within the group."27

and any person other than the [defendant]." New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated 632-A:6.

        In State v. Baker,2" Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, reversed a
conviction for felonious sexual assault because the trial court had denied a hearing to assess
the "probative vs. prejudicial" question in order to save time. Justice Souter wrote: "What
is more important, in any event, is that a...hearing is a due process requirement, which must
be given a higher priority than efficiency in the use of jurors' and witnesses' time."29

        In State v. Knowles,30 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed a
conviction for driving under the influence, second offense. The defendant's mother had
told an investigating officer at the scene where a car had snapped a utility pole that despite
her efforts to dissuade the defendant from driving, he "drove off and hit the pole." At trial,
she disavowed any knowledge of the incident and the defense moved to exclude as hearsay
her statement to the officer. The trial judge admitted the statement under the "catch-all"
exception to the rule against hearsay. Justice Souter, affirming this ruling, wrote that "we
cannot say the trial judge was clearly wrong in thinking the police had done as much as
they reasonably should have on the evening of the event."31

        B. Labor Law. In Panto v. Moore Business Forms, Inc.,32 Justice Souter, writing for
a unanimous court, answered two questions certified to the justices by the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Hampshire. The plaintiff worked for 12 years'as an at-will
employee.33 In preparation for lay-offs, the employer unilaterally promulgated to its
employees a written policy statement announcing the employer's intention to continue
salary and benefits for a limited period after the lay-off. Applying traditional contract
concepts,34 Justice Souter held that promulgation of this statement "may be treated as an
offer subject to an employee's acceptance, to be expressed by the continued performance

of his duties, upon which an'enforceable unilateral contract term will be formed."35
Therefore, the necessary elements of proof are unilateral offer, acceptance, and
consideration.36 Justice Souter viewed this as more like a case involving deferred
compensation than a "handbook case" in which at-will employees seek to enforce terms in
a handbook existing from the time they were hired.

         In Appeal of White Mountain Education Association,37 Justice Souter, writing for a
unanimous court, affirmed a decision by the Public Employee Labor Relations Board
dismissing an action on behalf of a discharged school custodian. That complaint alleged
the custodian was fired in retaliation for his union membership. The board initially found
for the employee, ordering reinstatement without back pay. On rehearing, the board
dismissed the complaint altogether. Justice Souter noted that a party who has not applied
for a rehearing before the agency may not take an appeal to the state supreme court. This
means that "[w]hen a decision on any issue is reversed on rehearing, the newly losing party
must apply for a further rehearing and satisfy [statutory requirements] before appealing to
this court."3' The court nevertheless chose not to dismiss the appeal because "it appears
that each party erroneously assumed that the association's earlier motion for rehearing
satisfied the [statutory requirements] as a condition for this appeal."39 On the merits, the
court held that the burden is on the union to prove "some minimal degree of retaliatory
motivation."40 The court refused to "place a burden on an employer to justify his action
upon a mere claim of retaliation or upon the complainant's introduction of any evidence
of retaliation."41

        C. Family Law. In the area of family law, Justice Souter consistently maintained his
commitment to the rule of law while achieving results that furthered New Hampshire's
interest in upholding parental rights and strengthening family unity. He did not second-
guess the legislature. He did not substitute any personal preferences about the meaning
or definition of "family" or any "enlightened" notions about "domestic arrangements" in the
1980s. Rather, he faithfully applied the law.

        In In re Noali W.*2 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, held that a finding
of abuse by a district court is a prerequisite to a probate court's termination of parental
rights. He utilized "the standard of statutory construction by reference to the plain meaning
of the language employed."43 His conclusion stemmed in part from his observation that the
legislature's objectives included "the preservation of family unity" and corresponding
protection of parental rights, as well as "the reunification of families that have been split
by dispositional orders in abuse cases."44

        In In re Adam E.,46 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, held that while a
district court judge in New Hampshire can terminate parental rights, "the order must
include a statement of conditions on which the parent may regain custody and a plan of
services to help the parent and the child."46 Even though the court acknowledged that, in
that case, there appeared very little chance that the family could be reunited because of the
mother's mental illness, it nonetheless preserved procedural safeguards against the
unconditional termination of parental rights.

         In In re Jason C." Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed a lower
court ruling that two unmarried adults may not jointly petition to adopt a child. Striving
for a construction "consistent with legislative intent," Justice Souter concluded that "it was
the legislature's intent to confine adoption to applicants who will probably provide a unified
and stable household for the child."48

         In Matter of Matthew G.,49 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the
denial of a mother's petition to terminate the parental rights of her former husband
because of abandonment. In addition to maintaining jurisdictional rules of timeliness,50 the
court held that a finding of abandonment does not itself require considering the "best

              The plaintiff claimed error in the introduction of hearsay evidence. The record did not disclose any
objection at trial. Therefore, citing a case from 1862, Justice Souter held that the "attempt to raise the issue
is untimely." Id. at 1366.

interest of the child." Noting that "a determination of abandonment is essentially factual,"
the court decided that "the conclusion of what is in the child's best interest is not an
evidentiary fact" and "has no logical tendency to prove that the parent in question
abandoned the child."51

         D. First Amendment - Libel. In the area of libel, Justice Souter's analysis and
application of the law has been clear and thorough in every case. He has not exhibited a
knee-jerk approach that anyone can print what he chooses without being held accountable.
He has made the necessary distinctions between different forms of printed material and has
not hesitated to correct a trial judge's too-hasty decision to deny a plaintiff the opportunity
for his day in court.

        In Duchesnaye v. Munro Enterprises, Inc." Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous
court, affirmed a superior court judgment in favor of the plaintiff with respect to an
editorial." The paper printed an editorial which, if read in conjunction with a factually
correct news story, "could be understood to describe the plaintiff as needing psychiatric help
for instability, and it could be read to imply that the plaintiff had made obscene telephone
calls."5* Justice Souter applied the rule that "a statement in the form of an opinion may be
read to imply defamatory facts, and it is actionable if it is actually understood that way."55

        In Nash v. Keene Publishing Corp.,5' Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court,
reversed the trial court's summary judgment for the defendant newspaper and remanded
for trial. The newspaper printed a letter imputing behavior, "as well as personal limitations
and proclivities, that would be highly undesirable in a police officer" written by an
individual whom the plaintiff officer had arrested and restrained.57 Although it was the
newspaper's stated policy not to print "allegations we are unable to verify independently,"

it failed to substantiate statements in the letter and later published an apology. Justice
Souter concluded that it was error for the trial court to find that the letter must necessarily
be read as "a non-actionable expression of opinion."5* He also found that the officer's
status as a "public official" for purposes of a libel action59 must be left to the jury.60

        In Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.," a woman sued Hustler for publishing defamatory
material. By the time she brought suit, only New Hampshire's 6-year statute of limitations
remained intact. Even though the plaintiff was a resident of New York, the defendants
were residents of Ohio, and 99% of the libelous material was circulated outside of New
Hampshire, she brought suit there and won a $2 million judgment. On appeal, the chief
judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit certified two questions to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court. The court unanimously agreed to adopt the "single publication"
rule for cases of multistate dissemination of defamatory material. The majority also applied
New Hampshire's statute of limitations to the entire action for damages arising in all 50
states. While accepting the basic rule that procedural issues are to be decided by the law
of the forum state, Justice Souter in dissent wrote that there is "nothing inherently
persuasive in characterizing a statute [of limitations] as merely procedural....Nor is there
anything persuasive in the reasoning of our prior cases that have so held."62 Examining
precedents dating back to 1940, Justice Souter concluded that the court's 1978 decision in
Gordon v. Gordon,'3 which held that a limitation statute is procedural, was an aberration
that failed to appropriately address the issue and ignored prior case law. As a result,
Justice Souter wrote that "the Gordon rule is manifestly devoid of reasoned support,
and...persuasive authority counsels] for the repudiation of Gordon.""

         E. First Amendment - Freedom of Association. In In re Chapman," the court held
that active opposition by the Board of Governors of the State Bar Association8' to tort
reform legislation was not within the mandate of the Association's constitution.67 "Positions
taken by the Association and its Board should be tailored carefully and limited to issues
clearly within the Association's constitutional mandate." The court viewed this mandate
narrowly to include "those matters which are related directly to the efficient administration
of the judicial system; the composition and operation of the courts; and the education,
ethics, competence, integrity and regulation, as a body, of the legal profession."" Justice
Souter joined Justice Brock's opinion, but concurred specially. He wrote that when "the
compulsory organization uses dues or fees to finance political or ideological activities that
are not reasonably related to the responsibilities that justify the compulsion to join, it
infringes on the first amendment rights of members who dissent from the organization's
positions."89 This suggests that Justice Souter's view of what must justify using compulsory
dues and fees for activities unrelated to the central mission of a compulsory organization
may have been more relaxed than the majority.

        F. Fourth Amendment - Search and Seizure. Justice Souter's opinions in this area
demonstrate that he has avoided the imaginative bias of many liberal judges that readily
deems necessary and appropriate investigative efforts by law enforcement officials to be
unconstitutional "searches." Such judges often appear to presume that a search is
automatically "unreasonable." As in other areas, Justice Souter rigorously and even-
handedly applied the law but resisted invitations to impose extra-legal standards or "gut
feelings" of "fairness," thereby thwarting legitimate law enforcement activities.

        In State v. Valenzuela,70 Justice Souter, writing for a 3-1 majority,71 holding that use
of a "pen register" to record numbers dialed from the defendant's telephone was not a
"search" for constitutional purposes, affirmed a conviction of the controlled substances law.
He confined the analysis according to "the posture in which the parties have presented it,"

           6 5 509 A.2d 753 (N.H. 1986).

                The New Hampshire bar is a "unified" or "integrated" bar. Membership is compulsory in order to
practice law in the state.

                 The U.S. Supreme Court recently reached a similar conclusion with regard to the integrated
California bar. See Keller v. State of California, 58 U.S.L.W. 4661 (June 4, 1990).

           7 1 Justice Thayer did not participate in this case. Justice Batchelder dissented because he would find
that the use of a "pen register" to obtain numbers dialed from the defendant's telephone was a constitutional
"search" and, therefore, must be based on a finding of probable cause. Id. at 1268.

utilizing principles from the U.S. Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.72 He
carefully distinguished between the routine voluntary communication of electronic data like
the number dialed from the protected contents of a telephone conversation. Justice Souter
held that "there is no violation of constitutional privacy when the telephone operator acts
as a government informer by communicating what a defendant has addressed to the
operator, and we therefore find no violation when the 'hearer' is not an operator but a
machine receiving functionally equivalent information communicated by a defendant and
directed to the company."73 His analysis also reflected a thorough knowledge of criminal
procedure, for example, the difference between "stale probable cause" and "stale
information."74 Justice Souter found that the judge issuing the search warrant in the case
was neutral despite having given advice to the police. Nevertheless, he added "a further
word about it, with an eye to the future. Legal advice to police officers ought to come
from city or county attorneys, or from the attorney general's office, not from judges."75 This
again reflects Justice Souter's dual devotion to applying the law and to maintaining the
proper role for judges in our legal and political system.

        In State v. Koppel,TM the court held that roadblocks used to detect and apprehend
drunk drivers were an "unreasonable search and seizure" and reversed the trial court's
denial of the defendants' motion to suppress evidence obtained when they were arrested.
The majority went beyond the traditional "balancing test" between the value of a roadblock
to the public and its burden on individual drivers to announce a new test weighted in favor
of the latter and requiring that the value of the roadblock must "significantly" advance the
public interest. Justice Souter dissented, placing his emphasis on whether a particular
search was "unreasonable" rather than on the knee-jerk assumption that any search is
unreasonable by definition. He wrote: "Even assuming that such a weighted balancing test
is appropriate, I could not join in the conclusion that the majority reach, for I believe that
the evidence indicates that the value of the roadblocks in this case did significantly
outweigh the minimal disadvantage to the drivers whose cars were stopped."77 He
concluded: "Contrasting this significant public benefit with the minimal private intrusion,
I conclude that the roadblocks in question did not result in unreasonable seizures."7* He

                In doing so, Justice Souter again demonstrated his careful attention to the proper and limited role
of the appellate judge. H e did not purport to announce a new rule that the state constitution's protection against
unreasonable searches and seizures must necessarily be understood according to the U.S. Supreme Court's
Fourth Amendment holdings. Nor did he cast any doubt on existing state high court precedents. Id at 1257.

addressed the majority's "slippery slope" argument that roadblocks to find drunk drivers
today will mean stopping pedestrians to find shoplifters tomorrow by stating that
"[mjeasures that would be reasonable in policing activities of great risk would not be
reasonable as intrusions into the characteristically safe and innocent pursuits of social life."79

        G. Fifth Amendment - Miranda Rights. In these cases, Justice Souter consistently
demonstrated a commitment to apply applicable standards, but also to resist either
substituting his judgment for that of the trial court as found in the record or extending
rules of law beyond their conceptual limits. In short, he gave criminal defendants a fair
appeal but ruled against them if the law required it.

         In State v. Coppola,10 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed a
conviction for burglary and aggravated felonious sexual assault. The defendant had, prior
to his arrest, responded to police questions with a boast about being street-wise and
refusing to confess to anything. He claimed that this boastful statement amounted to an
invocation of his right against self-incrimination under the 5th and 14th Amendments to the
U.S. Constitution and that, therefore, it could not be used against him at trial. Justice
Souter refused to "expand [the Supreme Court's decision in] Jenkins [v. Anderson"] beyond
recognition by equating any occasion to remain silent in response to police questioning with
an inducement [to remain silent]."" The most significant flaw in the defendant's argument
was "the factual unreality of equating his taunt to the police with an invocation of his
constitutional right to remain silent....While post-Miranda invocations of a right to silence
are insolubly ambiguous...pre-Afiranrfa refusals to confess are not."*3

        In State v. Elbert,** Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court," affirmed a
conviction for attempted first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the attempt to commit
a felony. The defendant had fled to New York after committing the acts in question.
Police officers from New Hampshire retrieved him and, while in Connecticut, read him his
Miranda rights. He waived those rights and made statements to the officers which were
admitted into evidence at trial. The court held that the evidence supported the trial court's

finding of each necessary element - the defendant initiated discussion of the charges prior
to any waiver of Miranda rights, he understood and waived those rights, and he made a
statement voluntarily."

        In State v. Lewis," Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court," affirmed a
conviction for robbery and second-degree murder after finding that the defendant
voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and that admission of his confession did not violate
his right to due process. Police officers had spoken twice to the defendant before the
arrest, in each case giving him the appropriate Miranda warnings. They did so again before
questioning him after the arrest. "The defendant signed a waiver of the applicable rights
and made a confession that was later introduced into evidence at trial."89 Justice Souter
applied the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard under state law, even though the U.S.
Supreme Court recently held "that the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance
of the evidence."90 Finding that "the issue is a close one,"91 the court meticulously reviewed
each statement involved in the giving and waiving of Miranda rights. Noting that the
defendant was 28 years old, had a high school education, and was found free of drugs or
alcohol, the court concluded that the evidence pointed to "a correct understanding of
waiver."92 The court dismissed other arguments against finding waiver by stating that "the
defendant is seeking to extend Miranda beyond its conceptual justification, on the basis of
an argument divorced from reality."93

        In State v. Derby,9* Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed a
conviction for felonious sexual assault. A police officer read defendant his Miranda rights
and defendant initialed each statement to indicate his understanding, and then signed a
waiver and an agreement to answer questions. His subsequent incriminating statements
were introduced at trial. Justice Souter readily applied rules limiting the court's subject

matter jurisdiction, finding that certain issues were not properly raised.9* Even though the
defendant suffered from several ailments and was receiving half a dozen medications, the
court acknowledged that this evidence had been before the trial court and upheld its finding
that the defendant had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.

         H. Fifth Amendment - Self Incrimination. In a rare split decision, Justice Souter
demonstrated his willingness to depart from his colleagues when he felt the law required
it. In State v. Cormier,TM the court, by a 3-2 vote, affirmed a conviction for operating a
motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The defendant claimed that
evidence she refused to submit to a chemical blood-alcohol test97 violated her right against
self-incrimination under the state constitution.9' Justice Souter first held the constitutional
protection applied only to "evidence by a defendant that is of testimonial character"99 and
does not apply to "physical evidence such as a sample of defendant's blood...or to
demonstrations provided by the performance of field sobriety tests."100 The refusal in the
present case was "an act of choice to suppress physical evidence" and, therefore, non-
testimonial.101 Justice Souter also held that, whether testimonial or not, the evidence in
question had not been "compelled."102

         In another split decision, the court in State v. Denney103 reversed a conviction of
driving while intoxicated, holding that admission of evidence that the defendant had
declined to take a blood alcohol test violated his right to due process where the arresting
officer gave the standard Miranda warnings but did not specifically notify him that his

                The defendant relied not only on the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution,
which imposes a "preponderance" standard to prove waiver, but also on the parallel provision of the state
constitution, which imposes a "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard. Justice Souter rejected the state's argument
that the court overrule its precedent establishing the stricter standard as improperly raised. Id. at SOS.

provision and applies to evidence, as in the present case, that is "testimonial" in nature.

refusal could be used against him in court. Justice Souter dissented and concluded that the
Miranda warnings alone were enough to satisfy the due process requirement since one of
those warnings is that anything an individual says can and will be used against him in court.
Justice Souter went further, criticizing the majority's "more fundamental error...in holding
that due process requires such a warning at all."104

         I. Sixth Amendment - Speedy Trial. In State v. Tucker,TM Justice Souter, writing for
a unanimous court, affirmed the conviction of a fugitive from prosecution in spite of a ten-
month delay between arrest and trial. With "no suggestion of deliberate delay"108 and "the
want of any indication of actual prejudice to the conduct of the defense,"107 the delay alone
did not violate the Constitution.

         J. Criminal Procedure - Due Process. Consistent with his decisions in other areas
of criminal law and procedure, Justice Souter applied the law consistently and
dispassionately. He resisted creative attempts to challenge convictions through "back door"
arguments and would not tolerate the legal fictions that lawyers so often raise in hopes of
getting appellate judges to disregard lower court decisions and overturn convictions on
specious grounds. Rather, Justice Souter insisted on rigorous application of jurisdictional
requirements and "called a spade a spade" when identifying and evaluating issues before the
court.

         In State v. Goding,TM' the court affirmed a conviction of driving while intoxicated,
second offense. The defendant had initially been tried and convicted on DWI-first offense
in district court.109 He exercised his right to a fresh trial in superior court; a mistrial was
declared after the jury failed to reach a verdict on the DWI-second offense charge. He was
retried and convicted on the DWI-second offense charge. The majority rejected the
defendant's due process claim, based on alleged prosecutorial vindictiveness, that the state
is constitutionally prohibited from increasing the charge in superior court after the
defendant has been tried and convicted of a lesser charge in district court. Justice Souter
dissented from this portion of the majority opinion, writing that the defendant had not
"adequately raised any due process issue distinct from a claim of double jeopardy."110

         K. Criminal Procedure - Deposing a Child Victim/Witness. In State v. Heath?"
Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, answered four questions transferred by the
superior court following the defendant's indictment for aggravated felonious sexual assault
on a seven-year-old boy. Between the incident and the indictment, the legislature passed
into law a measure restricting a defendant's right to depose young victims and to provide
for use of videotaped depositions. As in other cases, Justice Souter began by determining
the "common usage" of the statute's critical terms.112 The court held that the statute did not
impose an absolute bar to discovery depositions of witnesses in criminal cases who are
under 16 years of age. Rather, a companion provision allows the trial court to order
videotaped depositions in lieu of trial testimony.113 "Legislative history indicates...that the
mandate to follow the 'manner' of trial was not intended to preclude discovery questions."114
A court can disallow deposition discovery of a young victim or witness without violating
constitutional standards of due process or equal protection.119

         L. Miscellaneous. Many decisions, of course, do not fit neatly into specific categories
or can be assigned to more than one. Several of these are significant and continue the
pattern established in the foregoing opinions of Justice Souter as a careful and conservative
jurist who follows the law and the facts while resisting the temptation to dictate results
based on his own preferences or irrationally expand accepted doctrines and principles.

         In In re "K;"116 Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court,117 reversed a superior
court order requiring a hospital to produce a nurse's report and minutes of a committee
meeting. The hospital claimed the documents were privileged under a New Hampshire
statute. Justice Souter began his analysis by stating: "The principal issue being the
applicability of the statutory privilege to the documents in question, our first concern is with
the words of the statute."118 The court, noting that "the statute's drafting is imprecise,"

further conducted a "search for the legislature's probable intent."119 It concluded that the
statutory reference to "a hospital committee organized to evaluate...." must be understood
"by reference to [a committee's] functional responsibility."120 "Those committees...would
include one on infection control."121

        In Opinion of the Justices,'22 the court, at the request of the state House of
Representatives, rendered an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of a proposed bill
that would prohibit homosexuals from adopting, becoming foster parents, or operating child
care agencies. Justice Souter joined the opinion.123 The court examined the proposal under
several different theories.

         * Under the equal protection clause of the federal or state constitution, the court
           concluded that homosexuals are not a "suspect class." There exists no
           "fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy....There is, further, no such
           right to adopt, to be a foster parent, or to be a child care operator....[T]rie proper
           test to apply...is whether the legislation is 'rationally related to a legitimate
           governmental purpose."1124 The bill's fully legitimate purpose was providing
           appropriate parental role models for children. The court concluded that
           prohibiting adoption or foster care by homosexuals was rationally related to this
           purpose; prohibiting operation of a child care agency was not because this activity
           did not "approximatfej a familial or parent-child arrangement."125

         * Under the due process clause of the federal or state constitution, there exists no
           liberty or property interest in adoption or becoming a foster parent "and thus no
           entitlement thereto." No procedural due process protections are therefore

          122 530 A.2d 21 (N.H. 1987).

               Such opinions never indicate individual authorship. Justice Batchelder separately stated that any
restriction in the bill on the activities of homosexuals was unconstitutional. This is likely the result that Justice
William Brennan, whose seat on the U.S. Supreme Court Judge Souter was nominated to fill, would have
reached.

          124 Opinion of the Justices, 530 A.2d at 24.

               Id. at 25. Because of this conclusion, the court did not further address the constitutionality of the
prohibition against homosexuals operating child care agencies.

            required. No issue of'substantive due process is raised because the bill furthers
            "the government's legitimate objective of providing adopted and foster children
            with appropriate parental role models."126

         · The court rejected any argument based on the so-called "right to privacy" or
            freedom of association under either the state or federal constitution.

         In State v. Grondin,'" Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court,12" reversed a
superior court order dismissing an indictment for violating a motor vehicle habitual offender
order. The defendant had been convicted three times for driving after suspension of his
license. After a hearing, at which the defendant was represented by counsel, the superior
court entered an order prohibiting him from driving until his license was restored. He later
moved the superior court to vacate the order, claiming the guilty pleas underlying his prior
convictions were made without benefit of counsel. The superior court granted the motion.
Justice Souter applied a prior supreme court decision holding that a defendant charged with
violating a habitual offender order may not attack that finding absent proof he had been
unrepresented by counsel at that hearing. Justice Souter was careful to make the
assumptions necessary to decide that particular case and avoid appearing "unduly ready to
reach constitutional issues that might not require decision."128

         In In re Sanborn,TM0 Justice Souter, writing for a 4-1 majority, reversed a probate
court order dismissing a petition for involuntary civil commitment. A man charged with
second-degree murder was found incompetent to stand trial. The state filed a petition for
involuntary civil commitment "on the ground of mental illness posing a danger to others."131
The probate judge concluded that the state had failed to prove dangerousness beyond a
reasonable doubt and dismissed the petition. The court overruled its previous decision in
Proctor v. Butler,132 which had established the reasonable doubt standard for civil
commitment, and held that "the clear and convincing standard must hereafter be employed
in civil commitment cases."133 The citizens of New Hampshire had approved a constitutional
amendment in 1984 establishing the clear and convincing standard for

commitment in cases of criminal insanity. The court unanimously concluded that "we
perceive no intellectually realistic basis for holding that due process can require a burden
of proof [for civil commitment cases] that is different from the State's burden when it seeks
commitment after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity to a criminal charge."134

        Judge Souter's views on civil rights are unknown. His record on the state bench
yields no evidence. While Attorney General of New Hampshire, Souter urged the U.S.
Supreme Court to review a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
upholding a federal agency's requirement that the state submit a racial breakdown of its
employees. New Hampshire, per Attorney General Souter, argued that this race-conscious
view violated the Constitution's mandate of color-blindness. A newspaper report stated
that, as attorney general, Souter referred in a speech to "affirmative action" programs as
"affirmative discrimination."135

                          JUDGE SOUTER'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

        This wide-ranging look at Justice Souter's decisions from the New Hampshire
Supreme Court intentionally avoids an analysis according to political "outcome" or
simplistic references to "winners" and "losers." A judicial decision which stretches concepts
to the breaking point, plays fast and loose with the facts, and neglects traditional notions
of jurisdiction can be no more acceptable to conservatives because it affirms a criminal
conviction than it can be to liberals because it finds a due process violation or reverses a
conviction. The integrity and independence of the judiciary, the validity of the act of
judging itself, depends on a foundational commitment to the rule of law. That commitment
must be above raw politics, it must resist forcing a pre-determined result "peg" through a
differently shaped process "hole." Especially in the context of constitutional law, where a
decision by unelected judges can trump the decision of elected political branches, the
commitment to the rule of law is paramount.

         When President Bush nominated Judge Souter, he stated that this nominee would
"interpret the Constitution" and not "legislate from the bench." This is another way of
describing a commitment to the rule of law. The evidence supports the President's
assessment. In various ways, Judge David Souter is a careful jurist who puts the rule of law
and the integrity of the process of judging above everything else.

        Judge Souter is a careful jurist who resists rules broader than necessary to
accomplish the task before him. He gives proper deference to the public policies
established by the people's political representatives and only voids them when absolutely
necessary. He does not force the law to say what is really his own preference or opinion.

This sometimes leads to results' that conservatives like; in other cases, it produces a tally
that liberals favor. Overall, however, Judge Souter rigorously - though not inventively -
applies the law, wherever that process may take him.

         Judge Souter is tough on criminals, some say. He is also tough on lawyers, insisting
that they do their job in preparing and presenting appeals. He will not do their work for
them. He will not accept "legal fictions," which are really bald requests for political results
masquerading as legal arguments. He puts arguments under the spotlight and lawyers to
their proof. He applies jurisdictional requirements consistently and even-handedly. And,
again, he is content wherever that process may take him.

         Consistent with his focus on the rule of law and his narrow view of the proper role
of judges, Judge Souter accepts and consistently applies the traditional standards of
interpretation. In statutory construction, his standard gives "reference to the plain meaning
of the language employed."1" In such cases, he writes, "our first concern is with the words
of the statute."137 If those are ambiguous, the central focus is on a "search for the
legislature's probable intent."138 In constitutional cases, he regularly applies the "clear rule
that 'the language of the Constitution is to be understood in the sense in which it was used
at the time of its adoption.'"139

         Another mark of judicial restraint is the refusal to reach unnecessary constitutional
issues. That is, if a case can be decided on statutory rather than constitutional grounds, a
court should take that narrower course. Justice Souter has indeed followed this tenet as
well. In State v. Grondin,TM for example, he was careful to make the assumptions necessary
to avoid appearing "unduly ready to reach constitutional issues that might not require
decision."141

         Judge Souter described his own judicial philosophy in the Senate Judiciary
Committee questionnaire he submitted at the time of his nomination to the U.S. Court of
Appeals. He wrote:

         The obligation of any judge is to decide the case before the court, and the nature
         of the issues presented will largely determine the appropriate scope of the
        principle on which its decision should rest Where that principle is not provided

        and controlled by black letter authority or existing precedent, the decision must
        honor the distinction between personal and judicially cognizable values. The
        foundation of judicial responsibility in statutory interpretation is respect for the

        enacted text and for the legislative purpose that may explain a text that is
        unclear. The expansively phrased provisions of the Constitution must be read in
        light of its divisions of power among the branches of government and the
        constituents of the federal system.

                            APPROPRIATE LINES OF QUESTIONING

        The Constitution identifies two powers involved in the selection of federal judges.
The Constitution grants both of these - nomination and appointment - to the President.
Consistent with the overall scheme of "checks and balances" which serves to limit
concentration of government power, the Senate has a role of "advice and consent" which
accompanies the President's appointment power.

        The battle over the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork marked a radical
aberration in the traditional understanding of the Senate's advice and consent role. That
traditional understanding was that the Senate should focus on a nominee's judicial
philosophy and overall qualifications. The Bork battle introduced the notion that the
Senate could also investigate and evaluate a nominee's positions on political issues, his
specific views on existing Supreme Court precedents and doctrines, and how that nominee
would vote in future cases.

         "Judicial philosophy" refers to a nominee's approach to the Constitution, to
constitutional interpretation, to the role of the courts in the American political and legal
system, and to the proper function and definition of judges and judging. A huge array of
questions bearing on various aspects of a nominee's judicial philosophy is available to the
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

         A classic example of the difference between judicial philosophy and politics comes
from Raoul Berger, retired Charles Warren Senior Fellow in American Legal History at
Harvard Law School. Professor Berger, a political liberal through-and-through, is the most
distinguished defender and expositor of the "intentionalist" school of constitutional
interpretation. He follows this process, this approach to judging, consistently to whatever
outcome it produces, whether he personally likes it or not. He writes: "I'm for
abortion...but along with almost all academics, I don't think the Constitution guarantees
if142

        By going beyond qualifications and philosophy to politics and outcomes, the Senate
went beyond an "advice and consent" role in the judicial selection process to an active role
in the judicial decisionmaking process. The Senate went beyond serving as a check on the
President's appointment power and claimed for itself an independent power in substantively
shaping the federal judiciary.

        A Department of Justice study concludes:

                 What distinguished the Boric, and to a lesser extent the Kennedy
        confirmation proceedings, therefore, was the equating of criticism of the judicial
        reasoning of a case with criticism of its substantive results, the confusion of
        political opinion with judicial philosophy, the use of statistical track records as
        evidence of judicial philosophy, and the attempts to obtain preconfirmation
        commitments on certain issues from the nominees. The assumption underlying
        much of this approach was that judicial philosophy and political philosophy are
        essentially identical, and that a nominee's political views will direct or even
        determine his judicial decisions. Indeed, the proceedings suggested not only that
        the judicial decisionmaking process is political, but that it ought to be.

                 To the extent such thinking has become prevalent in the Senate, the
        courts, academia, and in society generally, it threatens to compromise the
        independence of the Judicial Branch, and thus to undermine the legitimacy of
        its authority. Because an independent, apolitical judiciary is a vital part of our
        constitutional system, this in turn has implications for the structure and workings
        of our entire democratic system of government."3

        Interest groups, whether liberal or conservative, are wrong to call for any kind of
political litmus test. President Bush was entirely correct in not imposing one in making this
nomination; the Senate must not impose one when fulfilling its role of advice and consent.
Nothing less than the independence and integrity of the judiciary is at stake. Supreme
Court Justice John Paul Stevens addressed a session of the recent annual meeting of the
American Bar Association and echoed this theme. "Justice Stevens cautioned that for a
President or senators to pin down a nominee in advance [on specific issues or future votes]
discouraged open-mindedness on the part of the judge, gave an appearance of impropriety,
and threatened an independent judiciary."144

        Those who condemn efforts to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court as "political tampering" but who call for application of a political "balance" approach
to filling vacancies on the Court are disingenuous at best and lack any integrity at worst.

        The Senate must exercise its role of advice and consent in a way that respects the
unique nature and place of the judiciary in our constitutional framework. Questions that
require a nominee to bias himself publicly on issues that may well come before him later
as a judge essentially demand that he violate in advance his oath to support and defend the
Constitution. Litigants deserve as neutral, detached, and non-political a judiciary as we can
preserve for them.

                                               CONCLUSION
        President Bush has nominated a conservative jurist with a clear and consistent record
of judging rather than legislating. He faithfully applies the law rather than his own
preferences. That is, he is a judge, not a politician. An independent, restrained judiciary
that remains a co-equal branch of the federal government requires nothing less. The
Senate must not turn this superb nomination into its own version of "Court packing" and
thereby threaten the integrity of the institution itself.

                   UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                             SUBMITTED TO THE
                    COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

                         UNITED STATES SENATE

                              AUGUST 31, 1990
                                       1102

        This report on the nomination of Judge David Souter to the United States Supreme
Court is submitted on behalf of the 25,000 members of the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers and its state and local affiliates. Among NACDL's principal missions is to
guarantee that all persons accused of crime are afforded the fundamental rights contained in
the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

        The Supreme Court stands atop our system of government as the guardian of these
rights. When a new nomination to the Court is made, NACDL is committed to undertaking
a complete examination of the nominee's qualifications, including his or her substantive
pronouncements on issues affecting the balance between the powers of the government and
the rights of the governed~a balance which the nominee will be in a position to influence
significantly for decades to come. This is the report of a special committee of the NACDL
which was established to carry out this function.

        The NACDL Committee fairly reflects both NACDL's membership and the seriousness
of the task at hand. The Committee is comprised of a dean of a prominent law school, a
former U.S. Attorney, a former state prosecutor, and well known trial attorneys, including an
attorney from the State of New Hampshire.1 Moreover, the Committee has not limited its
inquiry to the cold record offered by the nominee's judicial opinions, but has inquired of its
members and other attorneys who have observed the nominee as a state prosecutor, trial

      1 The Committee is chaired by Terrance Reed of Washington, D.C. and includes: Thomas Dillard
and Charles Fels of Knoxville, Tennessee; Joseph Johnson of Topeka, Kansas; Mark Sisti of Chichester,
New Hampshire; and Dean Gerald Uelmen of Santa Clara Law School.

attorneys who appeared before him found him willing to apply the law in an even-handed
manner, including a willingness to suppress illegally obtained evidence in appropriate cases.
As an appellate judge, he displayed integrity in taking the factual record presented to him,
rather than resolving disputes based on assumptions or conclusions not borne out by the trial
record. Thus, in cases where the facts clearly favor the defense, Judge Souter has ruled for
the defense, an observation which is supported by the fact that every opinion he penned which
reversed a conviction was unanimous.

         Our examination of the nominee's judicial philosophy, however, has given us less to
commend. His approach to resolving cases is conservative and methodical. While elevation
to the Supreme Court would certainly give the nominee an opportunity to think on a broader
level, his record leaves doubt as to whether he has the ability or interest in doing so.

         Of the 82 opinions in criminal cases we examined, Judge Souter voted for positions
asserted by the accused only nine times, and did so only when the Court spoke unanimously.
Conversely, Judge Souter dissented three times from the Court's reversal of a conviction. Two
of these dissenting opinions are illuminating in that both involve instances in which Judge
Souter refused to recognize the greater protections identified by his colleagues under the state
constitution than those available under the federal constitution. See State v. Koppel. 499 A.2d
977, 983 (1985); State v. Dennev. 536 A.2d 1242, 1245 (1987). Of course, many of the 73
cases in which the nominee rejected defendant's position on appeal merely reflect the lack of
merit of those positions, but they also offer insight into the nominee's view of the Constitution
and the role it plays in protecting all citizens against the focused resources of the State.

         Several of Judge Souter's opinions reveal that the nominee is capable of a healthy
respect for the right to a jury trial and fair trial procedures, including the Sixth Amendment
right to jury trial. For example, in State v. Jones. 484 A.2d 1070 (1984), Justice Souter wrote
an opinion for a unanimous court which reversed a conviction because the trial judge
responded to a jury question in such a way as to intrude upon the jury's fact-finding dudes.
In Richard v. MacAslrili. 529 A.2d 898 (1987), Justice Souter reversed a conviction based upon
a nolo contendere plea because the defendant had not knowingly and intelligently waived his
right to a jury trial. Similarly, in State v. Hewitt. 517 A.2d 820 (1986), Justice Souter
overturned a defendant's conviction because the trial court failed to obtain defendant's
                                        1104

personal consent, as opposed to that of his lawyer, before excusing a member of his
deliberating jury. See also State v. Baker. 508 A.2d 1059 (1986) (reversing conviction for
failure to hold evidentiary hearing, a "due process requirement which must be given higher
priority than efficiency in the use of jurors' and witnesses' time").

         Finally, in State v. Colbath. 540 A.2d 1212 (1988), Justice Souter reversed a rape
conviction based upon a trial court's exclusion of evidence of provocative behavior by the
complainant notwithstanding the provisions of New Hampshire's rape shield law. The Colbath
opinion is particularly out of character, in that Judge Souter made a broad constitutional
holding when he could have reached the same ruling on narrower statutory grounds. While
the holdings of these cases are not remarkable, they do indicate that the nominee has the
capacity to appreciate the importance of many rights which are essential to the preservation
of the fundamental right to a fair trial. Moreover, these cases reinforce the conclusion of the
attorneys who appeared before the judge as trial attorneys that the nominee was genuinely
interested in providing litigants with a fair trial.

         The practical reality of our criminal justice system, however, is that only a small minority
of federal or state criminal cases ever go to trial. For most individuals accused of crime,
contact with the criminal justice system is limited to police encounters or other common
occurrences, such as bail determinations, that take place early in the criminal justice process.
It is in this vitally important area that the nominee has not proven as sensitive to constitutional
values as he has been in the area of trial rights.

         Indicative of the nominee's perspective is his opinion in State v. Coppola. 536 A.2d
1236 (1987), in which he upheld the admission into evidence of a statement made by a suspect
to police that: "I am not one of your country bumpkins. I grew up on the streets of
Providence, Rhode Island. If you think I'm going to confess to you, you're crazy." This
comment was immediately followed by the suspect's assertion of the right to see counsel
before further questioning. Rather than recognizing this as a brusque assertion of the Fifth
Amendment right not to incriminate oneself, Judge Souter held that this was admissible as
evidence of the suspect's consciousness of guilt. On federal habeas corpus, the First Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, however boastful, the suspect's words adequately
communicated that he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, and thus their
                                       1105

admission constituted reversible error. Coppola v. Powell. 878 F.2d 1562 (1st Cir. 1989).
         Of course, like everyone eke, Judge Souter is a product of his environment, and his

opinion in Coppola may just reflect the fact that his life has been far removed from the daily
realities that attend the lives of many of our citizens. Indeed, the nominee's distance from the
mainstream of American life is not only a result of his intensive legal training, but also a
matter of personal choice, as the nominee has acknowledged that he does not watch television,
listen to the radio, nor generally does he read newspapers. June 1, 1977, Deposition of D.
Souter, at 47, 107 in Wolff v. Thomson. Civil Action No. 77-143 (D. N.H.). Unlike the
nominee, however, many citizens are not well versed in the subtleties of constitutional
protections, and indeed, the Miranda opinion represents an effort by the Supreme Court to
inform citizens of their rights before they unwittingly surrender them. We would expect from
our judiciary a sensitivity to the fact that our constitution protects even those who lack respect
for the law, and that an effort, however crude, to invoke the protections of our Constitution
will be honored.

         Similarly, in State v. Penney. 536 A.2d 1242 (1987), Justice Souter dissented from a
majority opinion which reversed a defendant's Driving Under the Influence conviction because
the police failed to warn the arrcstec that his refusal to take a blood test could be used
against him in court. Justice Souter dissented from the majority's holding that this was a
violation of due process, and indicated that he would have held that the plain Miranda warning
given that anything the arrestee said could be used against him was sufficient. Again, the
nominee simply assumed that the average citizen would have the legal acumen to interpret
police warnings about silence as applicable to police demands for blood.

         We note that in his Dennev dissent, Justice Souter makes a disturbing and confusing
suggestion that the Miranda warnings must be so narrowly construed as to apply only to
situations where the defendant has actually remained silent, as opposed to making some verbal
utterance to the effect that he wishes to remain silent. He wrote that the warning given to
the defendant that "if he made any statement, it could and would be used as evidence against
him" was "certainly adequate to advise him that a statement of his refusal to take the [blood]
test would be so used." 130 N.H. at 223. He seemed to suggest that if the defendant had
remained silent instead of verbally declining to take the blood test, an entirely different
             1106

situation under Miranda would be presented and he would not now be arguing that the

admissibility of the statement should be upheld:

             (Lest there be anything misleading about my own reliance on Miranda, however,
             I should add that I do not rule out the possibility of a conflict between a
             Miranda warning of the right to silence and the introduction of evidence that
             subsequent to the warning the defendant chose to remain silent as a means of
             refusing to submit to a blood test under the implied consent law . . . This
             problem is not, of course, before us and it has no bearing on either the
             majority's or the dissenters' views of how to resolve the issue that is before us

             ···)

Id. at 224.

What is confusing is that he then goes on to point out that blood tests under implied consent
laws are not covered under Miranda anyhow, raising the question of whether he would venture
into this silence/verbal refusal distinction outside of the context of implied consent laws.

         Our concern is heightened by reference back to the Coppola case, where he found
the "if you think I'm going to confess to you, you're crazy" statement of the streetwise
defendant to be admissible evidence of consciousness of guilt rather than an inadmissible
invocation of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Do uncooperative or defiant
suspects get less Fifth Amendment protection than silent ones? Where would Judge Souter
come down on other possible ways of refusing to make a statement to the police-less defiant
statements such as "I'm absolutely not going to confess to you," or "I refuse to confess to you,"
or "I refuse to say anything"? Somewhere along this continuum, Judge Souter would surely
find a valid invocation of the right to remain silent, but we are concerned that his rather
wooden reading of the defendant's words, to the exclusion of their clear thrust and intent,
bodes ill for the serious protection of rights which the Constitution affords equally to all
citizens, whether articulate or not.

         Likewise, in State v. Lewis. 533 A.2d 358 (N.H. 1987), Justice Souter rejected a
Miranda violation claim by a defendant in what the nominee recognized was a "close case."
In Lewis, a suspect was read Miranda warnings, after which he inquired of the police what
the waiver language meant and whether he would be giving up his rights. The police
responded by saying "Oh no-no-no-not at all--not at ail." Despite this blatantly false response
by the police, Justice Souter found that subsequent answers of the police officer adequately
clarified what a waiver of rights meant. None of the officer's subsequent comments, however,
                                       1107

 clarified that the officer had misspoke, at best, in telling the suspect that he would not be
 giving up his rights by talking further with the police about the crime. Similarly, in affirming
 a conviction despite a defendant's contention that he was too impaired by medications to
 understand Miranda warnings, Justice Souter described the warnings given as "Miranda litany"
 and a "Miranda protocol". State v. Derby. 561 A.2d 504 (N.H. 1989). Such opinions by
 Justice Souter evidence an extremelyrigidand mechanical view of the Miranda ruling, and the
 fundamental Fifth and Sixth Amendment values it was designed to safeguard.

          In at least one respect, the difference between the nominee and Justice Brennan, the
 Justice he would replace, could not be more glaring. Justice Brennan was a champion of state
 constitutional rights, especially in an era when federal constitutionalrightswere being narrowly
 construed. Contrary to the efforts of some of his colleagues, most notably then-Justice and
 now-Representative Charles Douglas, who construed the New Hampshire Constitution as
 providing a broader body of rights than the Federal Constitution, see e.g.. State v. Ball. 471
 A.2d 347 (1983), Judge Souter, while on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, has attempted
 to limit state constitutional rights to those rights available under the Federal Constitution.

         For example, in State v. Koppel. 499 A.2d 977 (1985), a majority of the court, with
 Justice Souter dissenting, relied upon the search and seizure provisions of New Hampshire's
 Constitution to strike warrantless roadblocks. In State v. Bradberrv. 522 A.2d 1380 (1986),
Judge Souter wrote a concurring opinion in which he expansively interpreted prior precedent
as holding that where a defendant had not expressly articulated a specific claim at trial that
the State Constitution provides greater protection than the Federal Constitution, that no state
constitutional claim could be considered. See also In re Sanbom. 545 A.2d 726 (N.H. 1988)
(defendant's citation of inapposite state cases fails to raise state constitutional due process
claim despite reference to due process under state constitution.) Thus, when the nominee was
entrusted with interpretation of the New Hampshire Constitution he did not evidence any
interest in broad application of state constitutional protections, but rather declined to join his
fellow Justices when they chose to do so.

         Because the nominee would be replacing Justice Brennan, the Committee also examined
the criminal law opinions of the Supreme Court since the 1987 term to identify cases in which
Justice Brennan's vote was a deciding vote in a Court divided by a 5-4 split. Justice Brennan's
                                        1108

vote was important in forming the majority on issues ranging from the death penalty to double
jeopardy to flag burning. An index of these opinions is attached as appendix to this report.
While it is impossible to predict whether the nominee would have voted in the same fashion
as Justice Brennan, the nominee's record gives some reason for doubt.

          In summary, we find that the nominee, though conservative in judicial philosophy,
appears inclined to respect precedent, and disinclined to resort to "judicial activism"~either in
the sense of leaping to broader constitutional issues where narrower statutory ones will sufGce,
or of selecting or massaging facts to reach preordained conclusions. In this, the nominee
clearly falls within the mainstream of American jurisprudence.

          We have reservations, however, about his willingness to extend existing constitutional
protections to new situations where they would logically apply, and about his ability to resist
governmental invitations to curtail such protections in appealingly "modest" increments. By
this means, many cherished constitutional rights can suffer lingering death by a thousand
wounds. In part, this may reflect a lack of successful separation, to date, from the prosecutive
milieu in which his legal career developed. Or it may reflect a more troubling, innately narrow
vision of the Constitution's role in our society. Whatever the reason, we are deeply concerned
that the nominee has rarely displayed the courage to take constitutional positions independent
of those urged by the State.

          The picture that emerges from the nominee's jurisprudence is that he is driven by the
force of logic, rather than by experiences of the human condition. His interpretation of
constitutional rights tends to be crabbed, recognizing constitutional rights only where they are
clearly established and carefully preserved by both citizens and their counsel. Moreover, his
record is marked by a preference to halt any further extension of constitutional values.

          Thus, his enforcement of trial-related rights, versus pre-trial rights, may well reflect a
more general philosophical commitment to well established constitutional rights versus a lack
of enthusiasm for more recently acknowledged constitutional rights, such as Miranda rights.
This reluctance to embrace recently established constitutional rights may simply reflect a
judicial preference for recognition of textually rooted constitutional rights, such as the right to
a jury trial. Certain important constitutional rights, such as the right of privacy, fall within the
category of recently recognized, non-textual rights secured only by general constitutional
                                       1109

guarantees of "due process" or the Ninth Amendment.
        Nonetheless, the record demonstrates that the nominee endorses the principle of stare

decisis--following settled precedent. For example, in State v. Meister. 480 A.2d 200 (N.H.
1984), Justice Souter filed a concurring opinion joining in the majority's reversal of a lower
court's refusal to annul the defendant's conviction record. Justice Souter acknowledged that
he disagreed with the majority's opinion, but that it was based on an earlier case, State v.
Roger M. 424 A.2d 1139 (1981), in which his identical position as a trial judge had been
reversed on appeal. Casting aside his "personal considerations" about the correctness of his
position as a trial judge, Justice Souter observed that, "The consequences of what I believe was
an unsound conclusion in that case are not serious enough to outweigh the value of stare
decisis." Id. at 205.

        In this instance, the nominee's commitment to stare decisis, then, was sufficiently strong
to supercede his personal convictions. Nonetheless, the nominee also appears to recognize that
when the consequences of an incorrect decision are serious enough, the value of stare decisis
may be outweighed. Accordingly, while the nominee's record indicates a willingness to follow
binding constitutional precedent, it also indicates he is very sparing in the recognition and
enforcement of recently established constitutional rights. Especially when four current justices
have recently concluded that stare decisis, while a "cornerstone of our legal system,"
nonetheless "has less power in constitutional cases, where, save for constitutional amendments,
this Court is the only body able to make needed changes," Webster v. Reproductive Health
Serv.. 106 L.Ed.2d 410, 435 (1989), the nominee's commitment to stare decisis is a question
that will have a dramatic impact on the vitality of many recently acknowledged constitutional
rights.

         In summary, we have found the nominee to be highly qualified by means of his
intellectual abilities, his judicial temperament, his integrity, his experience, and his industry.
We are troubled, however, by his lack of sensitivity to selected but important constitutional
rights such as Miranda. We are also concerned that the nominee has not displayed much
independence from the views espoused by the State. Nonetheless, based upon the personal
experiences of counsel who have appeared before the nominee, we are reasonably confident
that he is capable of becoming sensitized to the critical role that constitutional rights play in

    39-454--91 36
                                          1110

   everyday life in America. It is our fervent hope that the nominee would seize the opportunity

   that has been extended him to breathe life into the guiding constitutional principles of our

   times. Accordingly, we do not oppose the nomination of David Souter to the United States

   Supreme Court.

                                                  APPENDIX

        The following cases are United States Supreme Court decisions involving a 5-4 split
with Brennan in the majority from October 1987 until June 27, 1990.

        James v. Illinois. 110 S. Ct. 648 (1990) - The exclusionary rule forbids evidence
obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being used to impeach the testimony
of a defense witness other than the defendant. Justice Brennan in writing for the majority
stated that the balance of interest changes when tainted evidence is proposed to be used
against witnesses other than the defendant This is because the prospect of a perjury
conviction is far more daunting to a witness than to a defendant who already faces
conviction of a crime.

        Idaho v. Wright. 110 S. CL 3139 (1990) - Any statements made by a suspected child
victim of sex abuse to her treating pediatrician and offered for admission under the residual
exception to the hearsay rule did not, when evaluated under the totality of the
circumstances surrounding the making of the statements, have the particularized guarantees
of trustworthiness that the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause requires for the
admission of out-of-court statements for hearsay exceptions that are not firmly rooted. The
existence of other evidence corroborating proper hearsay does not bear on whether the
hearsay is sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted.

        United States v. Eichman. 110 S. Ct. 2404 (1990) - The Flag Protection Act of 1989
which criminalizes the conduct of anyone who knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically
defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon the United States flag is
a content based restriction on expressive conduct that violates the First Amendment as
applied to the acts of flag burning in protest of government policies and the passage of the
Flag Protection Act itself.

        Gradv v. Corbin. 110 S. Ct. 2084 (1990) - The Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy
clause bars subsequent criminal prosecution in order to establish an essential element of an
offense charged when the prosection will prove conduct that constitutes a defense for which
a defendant has already been prosecuted. Here the defendant was arrested for causing a
fatal traffic accident. He pled guilty to two traffic offenses which included drunk driving
and failure to keep right of way. Several months later he was indicted on charges of
manslaughter. The bill of particulars stated that the prosecution intended to prove that the
defendant drove while drunk and failed to keep right of way. The Court, basing its
decision on Illinois v. Vitale. 447 U.S. 410 (1980), stated that the test is what conduct, the
State will prove, not what evidence they will use.
                                         1111

         South Carolina v. Demetrius Gathers, 109 S. Ct. 1110 (1989) - For purposes of
imposing the death penalty, the defendant's punishment must be tailored to his personal
responsibility and moral guilt. It is improper for the prosecutor to comment concerning the
victim's personal characteristics, as is allowing the jury to rely on this information in
imposing the death sentence because of factors about which the defendant was unaware
and were irrelevant to the decision to kill. Here, in the prosecutor's closing arguments, he
read to the jury at length from a religious tract the victim was carrying and commented on
 the personal qualities that the prosecutor inferred from the victim's possession of the
religious tract and his voter registration card. The Court held that where there was no
evidence that the respondent read either the tract or the voter card, the content of the
papers the victim was carrying were purely fortuitous and could not provide any information
relevant to respondent's moral culpability notwithstanding that the papers had been
admitted in evidence for other purposes.

         Mallard v. U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. 109 S. Ct. 1814
(1989) - In this case, an attorney who had recently been admitted to practice before the
District Court, was appointed to represent indigent inmates in their suit against prison
officials in a 1983 action. After the magistrate denied the attorney's request to withdraw,
he appealed stating that forcing him to represent indigent inmates in an action requiring
trial skills he did not possess would compel him to violate his ethical obligations and would
exceed the Court's authority under 28 U.S.C. 1915(d). In a 5-4 decision, consisting of an
unusual split, Justice Brennan wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Rehnquist,
White, Scalia and Kennedy. The Court held that 1915(d) does not authorize the federal
court to require an unwilling attorney to represent an indigent litigant in a civil case. As
the operative term is request, the Court differentiated between 1915(c) which states that
"officers of the Court shall use and serve all process and perform all duties in such cases"
and 1915(d). The word "shall" rendered section (c) compulsory, while 1915(d) states that
"the Court may request an attorney to represent an indigent litigant."

         Mills v. Maryland. 108 S. Ct. 1860 (1988) - The petitioner was a Maryland prison
inmate who challenged the death sentence he received for the killing of his cell mate as
being unconstitutionally mandatory under Maryland law. He claimed that the statute
required imposition of the death sentence if the jury unanimously found an aggravating
circumstance but could not agree unanimously as to the existence of any particular
mitigating circumstance. The Court held that in a capital case, the sentence may not be
precluded from considering any relevant factors as mitigating circumstances. If the
petitioner's assertion was correct, and the jury believed they were unable to consider any
mitigating circumstances unless they unanimously agreed on the existence of a single
mitigating factor, then the case must be remanded for resentencing.

         Houston v. Lack, 108 S. Ct. 1008 (1988) - A prisoner's delivery to prison authorities
for forwarding to a Federal District Court of a Notice of Appeal in a case in which the
prisoner is acting pro se amounts to the filing of the notice within the meaning of Federal
Rule of AppeUate Procedure 4(a)(l) which sets a 30 day time limit for the filing of such a
notice with the clerk of the court.

         Thompson v. Oklahoma. 108 S. Ct. 2687 (1988) - The Eighth Amendment's
prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment forbids a capital defendant who is less than 16
years of age at the time of the offense from being sentenced to death under statutes that
do not set a minimum age in which the commission of a capital crime can make the
defendant subject to the death penalty.

          MEMORANDUM

NARAL TO: Members of The United States Senate Judiciary Committee
             FROM: Dawn Johnsen, Legal Director
             DATE: September 21, 1990
             RE: Judge David Soutcr's Testimony Regarding The Fundamental Right to Privacy

             Introduction

             Before the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on Judge David Souter's
             nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, NARAL urged the Committee to question Judge
             Souter about his views on the level of constitutional protection afforded the right
             to privacy, including the right to choose abortion. Although his record contained no
             definitive indication of his views in this area, all of the available evidence
             suggested that Judge Souter was likely to refuse to protect the right to choose. We
             therefore felt that it was essential for the Committee to ascertain Judge Souter's
             general legal approach and reasoning in this critical area. We at no time, however,
             suggested that Judge Souter should be required to state how he would decide a
             specific fact-contingent case prior to reviewing the record or briefs, nor did we
             suggest that Judge Souter should be required to give the Committee an irrevocable
             commitment as to the legal approach he would use.

             We felt it was necessary to consider Judge Souter's views on the right to choose due
             to the exceptional circumstances surrounding his nomination: For the past decade,
             our Presidents have made nominations to the federal judiciary after having pledged ~
             in three consecutive Republican Party Platforms -- to use the judicial appointment
             process to deprive women of their fundamental right to make their own decision
             whether or not to continue a pregnancy. With each Supreme Court nomination during
             that period, the Administrations made good on their promise. They have succeeded in
             diminishing the support for the right to choose from a strong 7-2 majority to the
             point where the Supreme Court is currently at best one vote away from overruling Roe
             v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973).

             For the Senate to confirm Judge Souter without determining whether he recognizes the
             right to choose would be to acquiesce in this strategy to take away a fundamental
             constitutional right for the first time in our Nation's history. NARAL therefore
             urged the Senate to oppose Judge Souter's confirmation unless he openly recognized
             that the fundamental right to privacy extends to a woman's decision whether or not to
             have an abortion.

             During the course of the hearings, several senators - most notably Chairman Biden
            and Senators Simon, Metzenbaum and Leahy -- repeatedly asked questions of Judge
            Souter aimed at learning if he regards a woman's decision whether or not to continue
            a pregnancy as a constitutionally protected fundamental right. Despite his
             willingness to discuss his approach to reviewing a variety of important
            constitutional issues, Judge Souter chose to be silent on this vital issue. His
            cryptic comments revealed only that he recognizes a "marital right to privacy."
            This is precisely the narrow definition of the right to privacy offered by many who
            seek to overrule Roe v. Wade. Because Judge Souter refused to answer these
            questions and did not rebut the strong presumption that he does not support the
            fundamental right to choose, the Senate should refuse to consent to his nomination.

The Fundamental Right to Choose

At no time during his testimony did Judge Souter give any indication that he views
the right of a woman to decide whether or not to have an abortion as a fundamental
right. He closed the door to this line of inquiry with his answer to the first
question addressed to him, which was posed by Chairman Biden. Judge Souter could not
have been more adamant in his refusal to respond to any question that might provide
insight into his approach to this issue. For example, on this basis. Judge Souter
refused to provide specific answers to questions about the outcomes in other privacy
cases, such as Griswold v. Connecticut. 381 U.S. 479 (1965) and Moore v. East
Cleveland. 431 U.S. 494 (1977), (9/13, pp. 104, 114), refused to answer certain
questions regarding the factors he would use to determine if the right to choose is
fundamental, (9/13, p. 120; 9/14, p. 138), and refused to discuss his personal views
on the morality of abortion, (9/14, pp. 183-90).

   I would not think that it was appropriate to express a specific opinion on the
   exact result in Griswold. for the simple reason that as clearly as I will try to
   describe my views on the right of privacy, we know that the reasoning of the
   Court in Griswold. including opinions beyond those of Justice Harlan, are taken
   as obviously a predicate toward the one case which has been on everyone's mind
   and on everyone's lips since the moment of my nomination -- Roe v. Wade, upon
   which the wisdom or the appropriate future of which it would be inappropriate for
   me to comment. (9/13, p. 104).

Although he scrupulously avoided revealing his views on the merits, Judge Souter did
indicate that he views the existence of a fundamental right to choose as an open
question that "is something which is going to have to be developed by the courts
over the course of probably a great many years." (9/14, p. 59; 9/14, p. 108; 9/17,
p. Ill; 9/17, p. 133) He at no point acknowledged that it is well-established
precedent that should be regarded as having been settled. Judge Souter also stated
that he has not made up his mind as to whether or not he would vote to uphold Roe v.
Wade. (9/14, p. 128)

As Chairman Biden persuasively demonstrated, Judge Souter answered questions on many
other issues -- including those likely to come before the Court -- of precisely the
type he refused to answer in the abortion context -- that is, concerning the level
of constitutional protection he would afford an asserted right and the general legal
analysis he would use to approach the issue. Without offering a convincing
justification. Judge Souter singled this one issue out for silence. (9/14, pp. 146-
48, 151-52; 9/18, pp. 70-72)

The Fundamental "Marital Right to Privacy"

Throughout his testimony, Judge Souter remained committed to the line he drew in his
first exchange with Chairman Biden: he would say only that among the fundamental
rights guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the
"marital right to privacy" which includes the right of a married couple to
procreate. Judge Souter was extraordinarily careful always to use "marital" as a
qualifier each and every time he described what he views as part of the fundamental
right to privacy. (9/13, pp. 112-13, 114, 116; 9/14, p. 59; 9/17, pp. 23, 111, 112)
                                         1114

Although he clearly and repeatedly recognized "marital privacy" as a fundamental
right, Judge Souter stated that he would not "endorse the specific holding of
Griswold or its opinions," and that if Roe were overturned, the continued validity of
the prior privacy cases would be called into question. (9/17, p. Ill)

Significantly, Judge Souter would not say whether he views the right of unmarried
individuals to use contraception as fundamental. In his first exchange with Chairman
Biden about Eisenstadt v. Baird. 405 U.S. 438 (1972), Judge Souter avoided
indicating whether the fundamental right to privacy extends to the right of unmarried
women and men to use contraception. He focused on the technical fact that the case
was decided on equal protection grounds and only stated the obvious and legally
irrefutable point that "there is going to be an equal protection implication from
whatever bedrock start privacy is derived under the concept of due process." (9/13,
P. 112)

When later questioned by Senators Metzenbaum and Leahy, Judge Souter again gave an
exceedingly narrow and uninformative answer, focusing on the equal protection
analysis used in Eisenstadt. (9/14, pp. 25-26; 9/17, p. 25-26) Only when explicitly
pushed by Senators Biden and Leahy would Judge Souter answer the question in terms of
the fundamental right to privacy, and then his responses were profoundly disturbing.
Judge Souter described the question whether unmarried individuals possess the
fundamental right to use contraception as "an open question" and stated "I do not
think that is a simple question to answer." (9/17, p. 28) Moreover, for the reasons
described by Chairman Biden, Judge Souter's description of the approach he would take
to determine whether unmarried individuals enjoy the fundamental right to use
contraceptives, was -- in Chairman Biden's words -- "worrisome." (9/17, p. 27)

Discussion and Analysis

Clearly, Judge Souter did not state that he recognizes a woman's fundamental right to
make her own decision whether or not to have an abortion. Nor do his repeated
references to fundamental aspects of <t "marital right to privacy" give any indication
that he would recognize the right to choose as fundamental. In fact, these
references are far more troubling than reassuring. His very deliberate use of
"marital" to qualify the scope of the privacy right leaves wide open the possibility
that he believes that the fundamental right to privacy does not extend to either the
right choose abortion or the right of unmarried people to use contraception.

In fact, those who advocate overruling Roe typically purport to support Griswold.
See, e.g.. Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Appellants at 12
n.9, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. 109 S. Ct. 3040 (1989) (plurality);
Webster. 109 S. Ct. at 3057-58 (Rehnquist, C.J., White, Kennedy, JJ.). One approach
commonly used to attempt to distinguish the cases is to describe the fundamental
right at stake in Griswold in the most limited terms possible: not as an individual
right, but as a right that exists within some aspects of a marital relationship --
the precise characterization offered by Judge Souter.

Judge Souter's focus on the right as a "marital" right is at odds with the Supreme
Court's view that the fundamental right to privacy is a right of the individual, and
does not depend on the marital relationship. While Judge Souter was correct in
saying that Eisenstadt was decided on equal protection grounds, he ignored that the
                                    1115

opinion also made clear that the fundamental privacy right recognized in Griswold is
possessed by "the individual, married or single":

   It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the
   marital relationship. Yet the married couple is not an independent entity with a
   mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a
   separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means
   anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from
   unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a
   person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.

Eisenstadt v. Baird. 405 U.S. 438, 453 (1972) (plurality) (emphasis in original).

Elsewhere, too, the Supreme Court describes the right recognized in Griswold in ways
studiously avoided by Judge Souter, presumably because the Court's characterizations
highlight the natural progression from Griswold to Eisenstadt to Roe and its
progeny.

   The decision whether or not to bear or beget a child is at the very heart of this
   cluster of constitutionally protected choices. That decision holds a
   particularly important place in the history of the right to privacy, a right
   first explicitly recognized in an opinion holding unconstitutional a statute
   prohibiting the use of contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut. ... and most
   prominently vindicated in recent years in the contexts of contraception, Griswold
   v. Connecticut. ...; Eisenstadt v. Baird. ...; and abortion, Roe v. Wade: Doe v.
   Bolton: Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth.

Carev v. Population Services International. 431 U.S. 678, 685 (1977) (citations
omitted).

Defining the fundamental right to privacy as a marital, and not an individual, right
-- as Judge Souter does -- has become a prime tactic for those who seek to justify
overruling Roe while ostensibly allowing Griswold to stand. This approach is clearly
illustrated by a recent debate in the academic literature. In an article published
in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. Walter Dellinger and Gene Sperling
convincingly argue that there exists no principled basis on which the Supreme Court
can continue to uphold Griswold but at the same time find that a woman's right to
choose abortion is not fundamental ·- with the possible exception of "reducing] the
case to a largely inconsequential decision." "Abortion and the Supreme Court: The
Retreat from Roe v. Wade." 138 U. Pa. L. Rev. 83, 94 (1989). William Van Alstync
responded with an article in the Duke Law Journal which does just that, by limiting
Griswold to a recognition of "marital privacy." "Closing the Circle of
Constitutional Review From Griswold v. Connecticut to Roe v. Wade: An Outline of a
Decision Merely Overruling Roe." 1989 Duke Law Journal 1677, 1678. Van Alstync
distinguishes and dismisses the fundamental right claimed in Eisenstadt as "a right
of fornication." and the fundamental right claimed in Roe as "a woman's right to kill
the gestating life within her solely according to her own choice, with any willing
physician's help," jdj. at 1678 n.5, 1679 (emphasis in original).

         On September 11, 1990, the National Women's Law Center
issued its report. Judge Souter and the Confirmation Process; The
Future of women's Constitutional Rights, focusing on the serious
concerns raised by Judge Souter's record on two issues of
critical importance to women -- the fundamental right to privacy
that includes contraception, pregnancy and termination of
pregnancy and especially searching judicial scrutiny of sex
discrimination under the equal protection clause of the
fourteenth amendment. Because these two constitutional rights
are the core principles upon which women must depend when the
government draws distinctions based on sex, the report concluded
that Judge Souter should not be confirmed unless he allays the
concerns raised by his record and demonstrates his commitment to
these bedrock principles.

         The National Women's Law Center has carefully listened to
all of Judge Souter's testimony and must conclude that he has
failed to allay the substantial concerns raised by his record and
to demonstrate a commitment to core constitutional principles of
fundamental importance to women. Thus, we must oppose the
nomination of Judge Souter to the Supreme Court.

         The application of the right to privacy to women has been
achieved through a long line of Supreme Court cases recognizing
that courts must subject laws that interfere with contraception,
pregnancy and termination of pregnancy to strict judicial
scrutiny. In the hearings, Judge Souter recognized that there is
a fundamental constitutional right to privacy and that the right
extends to procreation in marriage. However, he refused to state
whether the right extends to contraception generally or
termination of pregnancy in or outside of marriage. The
implications of his position for the continued constitutional
protection of pregnancy are also unclear. Judge Souter based his
refusal to respond to these central questions on his
unwillingness to indicate his position on the validity of Roe v.
Wade. However, these core principles could be and should have
                                         1118

been affirmed by Judge Souter; his doing so would not have
compromised his independence on the ultimate question of whether
he would overturn Roe v. Wade. Thus, Judge Souter failed to
allay the concerns raised by his record and failed to demonstrate
a commitment to women's fundamental privacy rights.

         So, too. Judge Souter failed to allay the substantial
concerns raised by his record on equal protection. Until the
middle tier heightened scrutiny standard for measuring sex
discrimination was developed by the Supreme Court, beginning in
1971, no law treating men and women differently had ever been
invalidated under the equal protection clause. Yet, as Attorney
General and as a New Hampshire Supreme Court judge. Judge Souter
repeatedly criticized the heightened scrutiny standard, and
during the hearings he reiterated several times these criticisms.

         Judge Souter stated that the middle tier level of scrutiny
is too loose a standard, allowing judges to slip toward the
lowest rational basis standard of review for equal protection
challenges. Yet, Judge Souter described his problem with the
current middle tier test in connection with its use in older
cases (Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia (1920) and Reed v. Reed
(1971)) where a less rigorous standard was in place than is now
the law, thereby leaving the impression that ht;viewed the middle
tier test as less rigorous than it currently is. Moreover, he
refused to commit to any test for sex discrimination challenges
under the equal protection clause beyond stating that he would
apply a test more stringent than the lowest rational basis
standard of review. His description of the current standard, in
combination with his refusal to articulate a test he would adopt
in place of the current standard or in any way to commit to a
standard at least as rigorous as the current test, leaves women
in the country without any assurance of meaningful protection
against sex discrimination.

         Moreover, Judge Souter's failure to demonstrate an
understanding of the nature of discrimination and the ways in
                                        1119

which it is eradicated does not bode well for his interpretation
and enforcement of equal protection guarantees. Judge Souter
acknowledged that as Attorney General of New Hampshire he
defended the refusal of the state to file statistical data on the
racial composition of its workforce against a challenge under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the state's use of
a literacy test against a challenge under the Voting Rights Act.
He stated, however, that his positions in these cases were not
positions he would have agreed with at the time if they were
presented to him as a judge, or positions that validly could be
asserted today by a state. Despite distancing himself from his
earlier positions, judge Souter continued to defend his advocacy
of these positions on the grounds that a state without racial
discrimination, absent considerations of a uniform national rule,
should not be required to file statistical data on race, or
prohibited from using a literacy test in a nondiscriminatory
manner. The suggestion that such an argument is an appropriate
defense evidences a lack of understanding about the way
discrimination may be revealed, since, for example, until
statistical data is collected discrimination may not be apparent.
Moreover, Judge Souter's assertion that New Hampshire was free of
discrimination in the mid-1970s when the state took these
positions lacks credibility and suggests an Attorney General
insensitive to very real problems of New Hampshire's minority
population. Rather than allay concerns about Judge Souter's
understanding of the nature of discrimination and the ways in
which it is eradicated, his statements _at the hearings serve to
intensify them.

         Judge Souter's persistent refusal to state his position on
key privacy concepts, and his failure to articulate his
commitment to an equal protection standard at least as strong as
the standard currently employed by the Supreme Court stands in
sharp contrast to his statements of adherence to basic principles
in other areas of the law, not only in cases representing settled
                                     1120

law, like Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and Boiling v.
Sharpe (1954), but also in areas where the basic principles are
still subject to controversy, like the key first amendment
establishment clause case, Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), and cases
challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty. Judge
Souter's failure to commit to core principles of privacy and
equal protection for women is no more acceptable than would be a
failure to adhere to the key constitutional principles
established in Brown, Boiling and Lemon.

         After carefully evaluating Judge Souter"s testimony, we
conclude that he has not met the burden incumbent upon him to
allay the serious concerns raised by his record and to
demonstrate his commitment to bedrock constitutional principles
of fundamental importance to women, we therefore oppose his
nomination.

                                    INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
        The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to
contain two core principles upon which women's access to the full
panoply of rights and opportunities in this country rest. These
principles are first, that sex discrimination must be subjected
to especially searching scrutiny under the equal protection
clause of the fourteenth amendment; and second, that there is a
fundamental right to privacy, which includes pregnancy and
termination of pregnancy. Any nominee to the Supreme Court who
does not fully support these two core principles should not be
confirmed to the Supreme Court. Therefore, Judge Souter should
not be confirmed unless he puts to rest questions raised by his
record and demonstrates his commitment to each of these key
doctrines of constitutional law.
         The first of these principles, that any governmental
distinctions made on the basis of gender must be subjected to
searching, or "heightened" scrutiny under the equal protection
clause of the fourteenth amendment, establishes that courts must
be more demanding of the government to defend policies or
practices which discriminate on the basis of sex than is the case
when most government policies are reviewed by the Court. Under
the heightened scrutiny standard, a state must demonstrate that
an important governmental interest is substantially served by the
discriminatory practice. Further, the test must be applied free
of fixed or stereotyped notions concerning the roles and
abilities of males and females.
                                      1126

        Until this heightened scrutiny principle was established by
the Supreme Court in 1971 in Reed v. Reed. 404 U.S. 71 (1971), no
law treating men and women differently had ever been invalidated
under the equal protection clause by the Court. Thus, Supreme
Court decisions upheld state laws which excluded women from the
practice of law, from juries, and even from holding certain jobs
unless a male relative was present.

         Since 1971, and the later Supreme Court cases which
developed and refined the precise contours of the heightened
standard for review of gender-based discrimination, profound
changes have occurred in our laws and practices. The Supreme
Court has struck down a wide variety of laws disadvantaging women
in many diverse areas of life, including women's right to serve
as executors of estates, secure Social Security and other
government benefits for their families, be supported by their
parents to the same age as their brothers, and manage jointly-
owned community property with their husbands.

         So, too, after 1971, key laws prohibiting sex discrimination
in areas such as employment, education and credit were passed by
Congress and in the states. These laws both implement the
Supreme Court's interpretation of women as specially protected
under the equal protection clause and also build on that
constitutional core principle to eliminate sex discrimination
broadly. As a direct result of Supreme Court precedent and these
anti-discrimination laws, substantial progress has been made in
opening opportunities to women, although much remains to be done.
                                     1127

        The constitutional fundamental right to privacy mirrors the
equal protection clause in its importance to women. As
interpreted and developed by the Supreme Court over many decades,
the right to privacy protects such central concerns as family
integrity, marriage and reproductive rights.

         The application of the right to privacy to pregnancy and
termination of pregnancy assures that its basic protections are
fully available to women, as they are to men. The Supreme
Court's 1973 landmark decisions in Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113, and
Doe v. Bolton. 410 U.S. 179, extended to women the privacy-based
right to abortion. Because the right is "fundamental," the
government must demonstrate a "compelling" state interest in
order to justify its restriction. So, too, the Supreme Court
relied on this right to protect women who chose to continue a
pregnancy as employees, Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur.
414 U.S. 632 (1974), and to receive unemployment benefits, Turner
v. Department of Employment Services. 423 U.S. 44 (1975).

         However, women's right to privacy is under serious threat.
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. 109 S.Ct. 3040 (1989),
has called into question whether a majority of the Supreme Court
will interpret the constitutional fundamental right to privacy to
apply to abortion, certain forms of contraception, and by this
questioning, to pregnancy itself. The new justice on the Court
could be the deciding fifth vote to overturn Roe v. Wade's
inclusion of abortion and contraception in the fundamental right
                                     1128

to privacy, thereby eliminating the need of states to demonstrate
compelling reasons for restricting the right.

         Further, the Supreme Court has signaled a serious retreat in
the constitutional protections afforded to young women's access
to abortion in Hodgson v. Minnesota. 110 S.Ct. 2926 (1990), and
Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. 110 S.ct. 2972
(1990). The Hodgson case highlights the danger, for in that case
four justices would have upheld a state requirement that two
parents be notified before a minor could obtain an abortion,
without even the safety valve of a requirement that a court be
available as an alternative where notice to both parents would be
harmful to the minor.

         The aspects of Judge Souter's record which bear on equal
protection and privacy raise serious questions about the nature
of his commitment to these two core principles. In the case of
equal protection, he has articulated legal theories and
approaches in written opinions which are antithetical to the
application of the heightened scrutiny test to sex discrimination
as we know it today. Legal briefs and statements he made while
Attorney General of New Hampshire add to the concern. Similarly,
with respect to the right to privacy as applied to abortion for
adult and young women, Judge Souter, both when on the bench and
as Attorney General, has articulated legal theories and
approaches which undercut the right.

         Because these two constitutional rights are the core
principles upon which women must depend when the government seeks
                                     1129

to draw distinctions on the basis of sex, there can be no more
important rights to which a nominee to the Supreme Court must be
committed. The absence in Judge Souter's record as it has come
to light of a clear sign of commitment to these constitutional
rights, coupled with the disturbing aspects of his record that
address them, makes it imperative that he provide the needed
commitment if he is to be confirmed.

I. JUDGE SOUTER MU8T DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO THE HEIGHTENED
        SCRUTINY STANDARD FOR SEX DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE EQUAL
        PROTECTION CLAUSE, AS SHOULD ANY NOMINEE TO BE CONFIRMED TO
        THE SUPREME COURT
        The Supreme Court's determination that women have a special

status under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth
amendment stands as a critical development in providing bedrock
constitutional protections for women. In practice, the
constitutional protection against sex discrimination has been
accomplished through the Court's use of a "heightened scrutiny"
standard to evaluate governmental classifications that
discriminate on the basis of sex. Any nominee to the Court must
recognize both that women are accorded special status under the
equal protection clause and that heightened scrutiny is critical
to eradicating unconstitutional gender discrimination.

        A. The Supreme Court Has Established A Heightened Scrutiny
                 Standard For The Review of Sex Discrimination Cases

        Before 1971, the Supreme Court was of the view that the
government could treat men and women differently under the equal
protection clause as long as any "rational basis" could be
advanced to justify the discriminatory treatment. This analysis
gave the government virtually unlimited leeway in treating people
differently on the basis of sex. Under the rational basis
standard, no sex discrimination challenge brought to the Court
succeeded. The Court upheld blatantly sex-discriminatory
statutes against fourteenth amendment challenges based on
rational basis review.
                                     1131

        In Muller v. Oregon. 208 U.S. 412 (1908), the Court rejected
a fourteenth amendment challenge to a law limiting the hours that
women employees, but not men employees, could work, holding that
the need for a woman to "properly discharge . . . her maternal
function," justified a law "protecting" women by limiting their
employment opportunities. As the Court explained in Goesaert v.
Cleary. 335 U.S. 464 (1948), upholding a Michigan law providing
that women could not work as bartenders unless they were the
wives or daughters of male bar owners:

         Michigan could, beyond question, forbid all women
         from working behind a bar. This is so despite the
         vast changes in the social and legal position of women.
         . . . The Constitution does not require legislatures to
         reflect social insight, or shifting social standards,
         any more than it requires them to keep abreast of
         the latest scientific standards.
Id. at 465-66.1 It is this complete deference to the legislature
that makes rational basis review fatal to a challenge to a sex-
discriminatory statute.
         In its landmark decision in Reed v. Reed, the Court departed
from the rational basis standard of review that had permitted
wholesale governmental discrimination against women. In Reed,
the Court for the first time struck down a sex-discriminatory
statute on equal protection grounds, holding that a state could
not automatically prefer men over women in administering a
decedent's estate, 404 U.S. at 75-76.

             See also Hovt v. Florida. 368 U.S. 57 (1961) (finding a
rational basis for a law giving all women an automatic exemption
from jury service that resulted in all-male juries).
                                     1132

         Beginning in 197-1, the Court has evolved an analysis, which
has come to be known as the "heightened scrutiny" test, or an
"intermediate" standard of review. It is called intermediate
because it is in the middle between the highest level of
scrutiny, strict scrutiny, which is the most rigorous standard of
judicial review of governmental actions,2 and rational basis
review, which is the most deferential standard.

        Under the intermediate standard, a party seeking to uphold a
gender-based classification must show an "exceedingly persuasive
justification" for the classification. This burden is met only
when the differential treatment is "substantially related" to the
achievement of "important governmental objectives." Moreover,
this test must be applied "free of fixed notions concerning the
roles and abilities of males and females;" the statutory
objective cannot reflect "archaic and stereotypic notions" about
men and women. Mississippi University for Women v. Hoqan. 458
U.S. 717, 724-25 (1982) (state-supported nursing school violated
equal protection clause by denying enrollment to men). At the
heart of this approach is the requirement that courts undertake a
more probing examination of governmental classifications than
would be required under rational basis review; the government's

                 Strict scrutiny review is applied to laws that infringe
on fundamental interests, see discussion infra, and laws that
classify on the basis of race, alienage or national origin. See.
e.g.. In Re Griffiths. 413 U.S. 717 (1973) (holding
unconstitutional a state's exclusion of aliens from admission to
practice law). This strict scrutiny is critical to the
elimination of discrimination against minority women.
                                     1133

justification cannot be taken at face value but must be carefully
reviewed.

        The Court most recently reaffirmed the "fully established
principles" by which to evaluate claims of gender discrimination
in Heckler v. Matthews. 465 U.S. 728 (1984), reviewing and
applying the heightened scrutiny standard set forth in
Mississippi University for Women v. Hoaan.3

         B. Heightened Scrutiny is Critical to Eradicating
                  Unconstitutional Sex Discrimination

         Employing heightened scrutiny, the Court has struck down
many sex discriminatory laws. See, e.g.. Frontiero v.
Richardson. 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (invalidating a statute which
required female, but not male, Army personnel to prove that their
spouses were dependent in order to receive benefits); Craig v.
Boren. 429 U.S. 190 (1976) (invalidating a sex-based age
differential for the legal consumption of beer); Califano v.
Westcott. 433 U.S. 76 (1979) (invalidating a provision which
provided aid to Families With Dependent Children to children with
unemployed fathers, but not mothers); Weinberger v. Wisenfeld.
420 U.S. 636 (1975) (invalidating a Social Security provision
providing payment to widows, but not widowers, with children);
Stanton v. Stanton. 421 U.S. 7 (1975) (invalidating a statute

              In Heckler the Court held that the temporary application
of the Social Security pension offset provision invalidated on
sex discrimination grounds in Califano v. Goldfarb. 430 U.S. 199
(1977), was substantially related to the important governmental
interest of protecting individuals who planned their retirements
in reasonable reliance on the law in effect prior to Goldfarb.
See 465 U.S. at 750-51.

                                                        10
                                     1134

providing higher age. of majority for males than females so that
males were entitled to parental support for a longer period of
time); Kirchbera v. Fenestra. 450 U.S. 455 (1981) (invalidating a
statute giving husband exclusive authority over community
property); and Califano v. Goldfarb (invalidating a Social
Security provision granting survivor's benefits to any widow but
only to widowers who had been receiving half of their support
from their wives).

         In a number of these cases, Chief Justice Rehnquist
dissented and applied a rational basis test under which he would
have upheld as constitutional laws that discriminated on the
basis of sex. See, e.g.. Frontiero v. Richardson. 411 U.S. at
691; Craig v. Boren. 429 U.S. at 217; Califano v. Goldfarb. 430
U.S. at 224.4 Thus, heightened scrutiny is critical to the
Court's determination that a law unconstitutionally discriminates
on the basis of sex. Any nominee to the Court must unequivocally
support the special protection of women under the equal
protection clause through the use of the heightened scrutiny
standard.

         C. Judge Souter And Sex Discrimination Under The Equal
                  Protection clause

         Judge Souter's writings and statements raise questions about
his commitment to the constitutional protection of women under

                 Justices Scalia and Kennedy have not yet addressed any
sex-based equal protection challenge, so that their position on
the proper standard of review is not known.

                                                        11

the equal protection clause which must be the basis for further
inquiry during his confirmation hearings.

         First, Judge Souter has employed a theory of constitutional
interpretation known as "original intent" which, if applied to
the federal Constitution, could effectively eliminate the equal
protection clause's application to women. Under this theory,
courts must interpret the Constitution only as the men "who
drafted, proposed, and ratified its provisions and its various
amendments" would have applied them in the historical context in
which they were written and written and ratified. See Bork, The
Constitution. Original Intent, and Economic Rights. 23 San Diego
L. Rev. 823, 826 (1986). Since the framers of the fourteenth
amendment were not concerned with discrimination against women,
if Judge Souter applied an original intent approach to a claim of
sex discrimination under the equal protection clause, rational
basis and not heightened scrutiny review would be employed, with
devastating results for the hard-won constitutional gains made by
women under the equal protection clause.5

         Second, Judge Souter's writings suggest that he may have
reservations and problems with the heightened scrutiny standard
itself, both as applied to cases of gender discrimination and as
part of any equal protection analysis.

         Third, Judge Souter's writings and statements reflect a lack
of understanding both about the nature of discrimination and

                  For a discussion of the implications of the original
intent approach for the right of privacy, see section II-C-1

about the role that sexual stereotyping can play in the
development of discriminatory classifications.

        Judge Souter must allay the concerns raised by his record
about his commitment to the special protection of women under the
equal protection clause and the necessary and appropriate use of
heightened scrutiny in cases of gender discrimination.

                 1. The Original Intent Theory, as Reflected in Judge
                          Souter's Dissent in Dionne. is Inconsistent with
                          Heightened Scrutiny standard for Sex
                          Discrimination

        The majority opinion in Estate of Dionne. 518 A.2d 178
(1986), struck down a law requiring litigants to pay special fees
directly to probate court judges for holding hearings on days
other than the ones fixed by statute. Writing that this method
of compensating probate judges in addition to their salaries
"smacks of the purchase of justice," the court held that it was
repugnant to the state constitutional guarantee that "[e]very
subject of this state is entitled ... to obtain right and justice
freely, without being obliged to purchase it." Id. at 179. In
reaching this conclusion, the majority looked not only to
historical evidence of the meaning of the constitutional
guarantee but also to contemporary factors: heightened public
sensitivity to the appearance of impropriety, as recognized in
rigorous standards of conduct under supreme court rules and codes
of judicial conduct; and evidence that the system had severe
problems in practice, including a report of the Judicial Council
concluding that it was "inconsistent with a professional
judiciary." Idj. at 180. Based on all of this evidence, the
majority struck down the law as unconstitutional.

        Judge Souter agreed with the majority's condemnation of the
fee law. He dissented, however, because he found that the law
was constitutional as interpreted under "this court's clear rule
that 'the language of the Constitution is to be understood in the
sense in which it was used at the time of its adoption,'" and

                                                        14
                                     1138

only this historical evidence is relevant to the court's inquiry.

Id. at 181, quoting Opinion of the Justices. 44 N.H. 633, 635
(1863),6 Judge Souter looked to two sources to ascertain the

intent of the framers of the constitution: the body of commentary

on the Magna Carta of 1215, from which the constitutional

language was derived; and the history of other New Hampshire laws

regarding probate fees. Delving into this historical evidence in

detail, he concluded that the framers did not intend to preclude

such a fee system, and therefore, the court could not find it

unconstitutional.

         It is not the purpose of this review to offer a lengthy

critique of the original intent doctrine. Others have shown that

the philosophy of original intent is not shared by judges in the

mainstream of the American constitutional tradition -- both

liberal and conservative -- who accept the responsibility the

framers clearly imposed on them to continue to develop and apply

                 Judge Souter also cited Opinion of the Justices. 121
N.H. 480, 483, 431 A.2d 135, 136 (1981), "as confirming the
vitality" of the original intent method of constitutional
interpretation. However, this case did not advocate relying only
on the framers' intent in interpreting the scope of the state
constitution.

         The court was called on to address the constitutionality,
under the state and federal Constitutions, of a bill that would
reduce the number of persons serving on juries in civil cases
from twelve to six. While finding that the law might pass muster
under the federal Constitution, the court held that it would
violate the state constitution. In reaching this conclusion the
court did not stop after determining the intent of the framers
but went on to assess the vitality of their conclusions today.
Citing a number of empirical studies that raised concerns about
the impact of smaller juries on group deliberation, the court
held that the bill would be unconstitutional. Id. at 137.

                                                        15

legal principles, which are necessarily imbued with moral sense

and values, to protect the rights of individuals against the

government.7

        Rather, the emphasis of this report is on the potentially

devastating consequences of Judge Souter's theory of original

intent if he were to use it to interpret the scope of individual

rights guaranteed by the constitution. When the original

Constitution and the Civil War Amendments, including the

fourteenth amendment, were drafted, women were not considered

                  In the words of Chief Justice Hughes, written over half
a century ago:

                  If by the statement that what the Constitution meant
                 at the time of its adoption it means to-day, it is
                  intended to say that the great clauses of the
                  Constitution must be confined to the interpretation
                 which the framers, with the conditions and outlook
                  of their time, would have placed upon them, the
                  statement carries its own refutation. It was to
                 guard against such a narrow conception that Chief
                 Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning:
                  'We must never forget, that it is a Constitution
                 we are expounding; a Constitution intended to endure
                  for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted
                  to the various crises of human affairs.· When we
                  are dealing with the words of the Constitution,
                  said this Court in Missouri v. Holland. 252 U.S. 416,
                  433 (1920), 'we must realize that they have called into
                  life a being the development of which could not have
                  been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its
                  begetters. . . . The case before us must be considered
                  in the light of our whole experience and not merely in
                  light of what was said a hundred years ago.'

full citizens.8 Contemporaneous interpretations of the Civil War
Amendments denied their applicability to women.9 Because the
framers of the fourteenth amendment clearly were not concerned
with sex-based discrimination, under an original intent analysis
there is no place for women in the equal protection clause.

         The Senate must inquire into Judge Souter's views on
original intent and whether he would use this theory to evaluate
a claim of sex discrimination under the equal protection clause.
Because the doctrine of original intent is inconsistent with a
heightened scrutiny standard for evaluating claims of sex
discrimination, Judge Souter's views on original intent are
critical to evaluating his commitment to the heightened scrutiny
standard. Although he has not articulated the original intent
theory in other cases,10 its potential consequences for women are

that of her husband; she was civilly dead. She could not sue, be

sued, enter into contracts, make wills, keep her own earnings, or

control her own property. Her husband had the right to restrain

her freedom and force her to engage in intercourse. 2

         10 In a recent interview with Judge Souter published in The
Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly, the paper reported him as viewing
the Constitution as a living document, quoting him on the subject
of original intent: "On constitutional matters, I am of the
interpretist school. We're not looking for the original
application, we're looking for the meaning here. That's a very
different thing." Legal Times. Aug. 31-Sept. 3, 1990, p. 10.
The relationship between this statement and the approach taken in
Dionne must be carefully examined.

                                     1141

so significant that the Senate must be assured that he will not
use this doctrine to limit the fourteenth amendment's protection
against sex discrimination.

                 2. The Briefs Filed bv the Attorney General's Office
                          Under Judge Souter's Name in Helaemoe v. Meloon
                          Directly Challenge the Appropriateness of the
                          Heightened scrutiny standard for sex
                          Discrimination

         In practice, the constitutional protection of women has been
accomplished through the Court's use of a heightened scrutiny
standard. Judge Souter's record as Attorney General directly
calls into question his support for the application of heightened
scrutiny to claims of sex discrimination.

         While Judge Souter was Attorney General, he decided to
appeal a federal trial court ruling that New Hampshire's
"statutory rape" law -- a law that prohibits intercourse with a
minor female regardless of whether she consents -- violated equal
protection because it punished males but not females who engaged
in sex with minors. See Nashua Telegraph. May 14, 1977. The
brief filed by Judge Souter and an assistant attorney general in
the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit primarily focused on
arguing that the statute was constitutional under the
intermediate scrutiny test. However, the brief took a passing
swipe at intermediate scrutiny in arguing that the test was
simply a variation on the lowest level of scrutiny, rational
basis review:

                 The State submits that the Reed - Craig substantial
                 relation test is merely a heightened form of the
                 traditional rational basis test. It is not an
                 independent and median-level standard. Rather, it

                                     1142

                 is a creation of the rational basis test, and on a
                 graduated scale would fall much closer to that
                 test than to the strict scrutiny standard.

Brief for Appellants, Meloon v. Helqemoe. No. 77-1197 (1st Cir.

1977) at 16. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court,

holding the law unconstitutional. Meloon v. Helqemoe. 564 F.2d

602 (1st Cir. 1977).

        The Attorney General's Office made its most vigorous attack

on the intermediate scrutiny standard in its Supreme Court

petition for certiorari.11 The brief advocated limiting or even

abandoning the heightened scrutiny standard:

         In sum, this Court has created a new equal protection
        test which resides somewhere in the "twilight zone"
        between the rationale [sic] basis and strict scrutiny
        tests. This new standard lacks definition, shape or
        precise limits. The instant case is a perfect example
         of what Justice Rehnquist feared most - the abuse of a
         standard so "diaphanous and elastic" as to permit
         subjective judicial preferences and prejudices concerning
        particular legislation. The instant case represents an
         opportunity for the Court to define, shape, limit, or even
         eliminate the new standard. In all events, it presents
        the opportunity for the Court to correct a situation which
         invites subjective judicial judgments and possible

Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, Helqemoe v. Meloon. No. 77-

1058 at 18-19, cert, denied. 436 U.S. 950 (1978)(emphasis added).

              The petition, too, was filed under the names of then-
Attorney General Souter's and an assistant attorney general.
Whatever may have been the level of review he afforded the brief
his office filed in the Court of Appeals in Helqemoe. it seems
unlikely that a petition for certiorari filed in the United
States Supreme Court would not have received his careful
attention. This is confirmed by the fact that Attorney General
Souter ran "a tightly-knit, tightly-run organization." See "Next
AG Plans Little Expansion," Massachusetts Union Leader. (Dec.
28. 1975).

                                                                19
                                     1143

        The Supreme Court denied certiorari but in 1980 ruled on an
equal protection challenge to a similar statute from California,
Michael M. v. Superior Court. 450 U.S. 464 (1981). The Court's
opinion reaffirmed that heightened scrutiny was appropriate and
upheld the law's gender classification finding that it was
substantially related to important governmental objectives.

                 3. Judge Souter's opinion in Citv of Dover Raises
                          Concerns About His Willingness to A P P I V the
                          Heightened scrutiny Standard for Sex
                          Discrimination

        As a member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Judge Souter
was bound by United States Supreme Court decisions that
interpreted the scope of protection of individual rights under
the federal Constitution. In several cases, Judge Souter briefly
referenced the heightened scrutiny test for gender, see, e.g..
State v. Heath. 523 A.2d 82 (N.H. 1986), but he has not applied
it to evaluate a claim of sex discrimination.

         However, in a dissenting opinion he authored in Citv of
Dover v. Imperial Casualty & Indemnity Company. 1990 N.H. Lexis
39 (1990), a case that did not involve sex discrimination, Judge
Souter called for reexamination of the state's "somewhat
heightened scrutiny" test. This standard, which under state law
applies to laws that restrict the right to recover in civil
actions, see Carson v. Maurer. 424 A.2d 825 (N.H. 1980), is less
rigorous than the federal standard for gender discrimination.
While Judge Souter has not indicated whether he would reconsider
the federal standard that applies to gender discrimination, the
strong criticism in the Attorney General·s petition for

                                                        20
                                     1144

certiorari in Helqemoe. as well as this dissent, raise concerns
about his commitment to heightened scrutiny that must be examined
during the hearings.

                 4. Judge Souter's statements in Connection with
                          United States v. State of New Hampshire Reflect a
                          Lack of understanding of the Nature of
                          Discrimination Essential to the Proper Application
                          of the Heightened Scrutiny Standard.

        The Supreme Court's recognition in the 1971 case Reed v.
Reed that sex discrimination must be accorded special scrutiny
under the equal protection clause was central not only to the
development of constitutional law, but also to the enactment and
enforcement of such basic laws as Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of
sex, race, national origin and religion);12 Title IX of the 1972
Education Amendments, prohibiting sex discrimination in
federally-funded schools; and the Equal Credit Act of 1973.
These laws both implement the Supreme Court's interpretation of
women as specifically protected under the equal protection clause
and also build on the core principle that sex discrimination
should be eliminated.

         In the almost two decades since Reed was decided and these
laws were passed, the Supreme Court has many times been faced
with interpreting the scope of discrimination protections, both
under the Constitution and statutes, and often these

         12 Title VII was amended in 1972 to include public and
professional employees within its ambit, specifically recognizing
for the first time the special problems of sex discrimination
which Title VII had to address. See 42 U.S.C. § 2 000e-16.

                                                        21
                                     1145

interpretations are related.13 Therefore, Judge Souter's record
regarding his understanding of discrimination in the context of
these anti-discrimination statutes is highly probative of his
adherence to the fundamental equal protection principles in the
Constitution.

         In United States v. State of New Hampshire, the United
States filed a complaint against the state of New Hampshire for
failure to comply with EEOC regulations interpreting Title VII
which required employers, including states, to file yearly
reports documenting the race and gender composition of their
workforces.K Before Judge Souter became Attorney General, a
federal trial court ruled against the" state. United States v.
New Hampshire. No. 75-197 (D.N.H. Dec. 22, 1975). In 1976, when
Judge Souter held the position of Attorney General, the state
appealed the trial court's ruling.

                 The Supreme Court, for example, decided that both the
Constitution and Title VII had the same meaning regarding the
inclusion of pregnancy within the ambit of sex discrimination.
General Electric v. Gilbert. 429 U.S. 125 (1976). Further, anti-
discrimination statutes have been challenged as unconstitutional
violations of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e.g.. Fullilove
v. Klutznick. 448 U.S. 448 (1980) (upholding the
constitutionality of a congressional set-aside program for
minority businesses); Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. 110 S. Ct. 2997
(1990) (Five-to-four decision upholding the constitutionality of
two congressionally-mandated FCC policies favoring minorities and
women, although the constitutionality of the preference for women
was not addressed).

         14 New Hampshire was the only state that failed to comply
with these EEOC regulations. Washington Post. August 1, 1990.

        In the brief filed with the First Circuit, then-Attorney
General Souter argued15 that the regulations went beyond the
authority of Title VII, were unconstitutional under the equal
protection clause, and violated other constitutional guarantees
including the right to privacy. See Brief for Appellant, United
States v. New Hampshire. No. 76-1018 (1st Cir. 1976).

         First, the brief objected to the requirement for gathering
statistics on the grounds that such data could be used to
implement a quota system in violation of Title VII. Id. at 11.
The First Circuit dismissed this argument, stating that the
statistics were "highly useful" in investigating and proving
discrimination and that "the possible and purely hypothetical
misuse of data does not require the banning of reasonable
procedures to acquire such data." United States v. New
Hampshire. 539 F.2d 277, 280 (1st Cir. 1976). Second, the brief
objected to the regulations on the grounds that they unreasonably
exceeded the authority of Title VII. Brief for Appellant, United
States v. New Hampshire, at 14. Again, the First Circuit
disagreed:

         We have no doubt but that the information sought by the
         EEO-4 form is both reasonable and fully consistent with
         the overall purpose of Title VII, viz. "to achieve

                  The available evidence suggests that Judge Souter was
involved in the framing of the arguments on appeal to the First
Circuit and Supreme Court: the name of Attorney General Souter
and one assistant attorney general appear on both briefs, and
that assistant has reported that Judge Souter was "supportive of
and involved in the effort." Legal Times. August 27, 1990, at
 10. In addition, then-Governor Thompson has stated that "I know
 [Judge Souter] did not discourage me" from pursuing the EEOC case
to the Supreme Court. Washington Post. August 1, 1990.

539 F.2d at 280 (citing Griaas v. Duke Power Co.. 401 U.S. 424,
429-30 (1971).
         The final argument, also rejected by the Court of Appeals,
was that the regulations violated the equal protection clause
because they require an employer to be color-conscious rather
than color-blind. Brief for Appellant, United States v. New
Hampshire, at 38. The Court held that the regulations were
consistent with Title VII's clearly constitutional purpose -- to
achieve equality of employment opportunities. 539 F.2d at 281.
         Despite the opinions of the federal district court and First
Circuit Court of Appeals holding in favor of the United States,
the Attorney General's office filed a petition for certiorari
with the Supreme Court reiterating the arguments made in the
First Circuit. The Court denied certiorari.
        As Attorney General, Judge Souter personally expressed views
consistent with the state's position in United States v. New
Hampshire in a May, 1976, speech. At a commencement speech at a
New Hampshire College, Judge Souter denounced the EEOC
regulations as "affirmative discrimination," which he defined as
"a policy whereby a person achieves eligibility for some service
strictly by virtue of his ethnic background." In the same speech
he asserted that affirmative action does not help those who need
it, and government should not be involved in it: "there are some

                                                       24
                                     1148

things that government cannot do, and our whole Constitutional
history is a history of restraining power."16

        The briefs in United States v. New Hampshire and Judge
Souter·s comments on the EEOC regulations at issue in the case
evidence a fundamental lack of understanding about the broad
anti-discrimination purposes underlying Title VII. Without the
ability to collect statistical information on the racial, ethnic
and gender composition of the workforce, the EEOC would be unable
to ascertain possible instances of discrimination and assure
equal employment opportunity, as Bush nominee and EEOC Chair Evan
Kemp has noted. See "Souter as State Official Opposed U.S.
Racial Breakdown Rule," Washington Post. August 1, 1990, at A4.
This evidence of Judge Souter's lack of understanding of
discrimination and lack of commitment to its eradication, raise
questions about his adherence to the fundamental equal protection
guarantees of the Constitution.

                  5. Judge Souter's opinion in State of New Hampshire
                          v. Colbath Evidences a Lack of Understanding of
                          the Nature of Sexual stereotyping That is
                          Essential to Application of the Heightened
                          Scrutiny Standard for Sex Discrimination

          Judge Souter's opinion in State of New Hampshire v.
Colbath. 540 A.2d 1212 (N.H. 1988), raises questions about his
ability to follow the Supreme Court's mandate that heightened
scrutiny be applied "free of fixed notions concerning the roles
and abilities of males and females," and free of stereotypes.

(1982) .

         In Colbath. Judge Souter atypically reversed a defendant's
conviction17 for aggravated felonious sexual assault based on the
trial judge's instruction that evidence of the victim's behavior
with men other than the defendant in a bar the night she was
raped was irrelevant to the question of whether she consented to
sexual intercourse with the defendant. Judge Souter held that
the victim's behavior could be relevant to the issue of consent
despite New Hampshire's rape shield law which, like its
counterpart in forty-seven other states, precludes evidence of
"[p]rior consensual sexual activity between the victim and any
person other than the [defendant]," when offered to prove a
sexual offense. 540 A.2d at 1215.

            Rape shield laws have a dual purpose -- they protect a
victim's privacy and help to assure that the jury considers only
relevant information, free from the erroneous stereotypical
belief that if a woman has engaged in sexual relations with other
men in the past, she is more likely to have consented to sexual
intercourse with the defendant. See Tanford and Bocchino, Rape
Victim Shield Laws and the Sixth Amendment. 128 U.Pa.L. Rev. 544
 (1980); Berger, Man's Trial. Woman's Tribulation: Rape Cases in
the Courtroom, 77 Colum. L.Rev. 1 (1977). See also State v.
Howard. 426 A.2d. 457 (N.H. 1981). However, rape shield laws

              A review by the National Association of Criminal Defense
Attorneys found that Judge Souter ruled in favor of the
prosecution in all but five of 75 criminal cases.

are not an absolute bar to the admission of evidence of the
victim's prior sexual activity. Under New Hampshire case law, as
in most other states, in order to protect the defendant's
constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him, the
defendant "must be given an opportunity to demonstrate that the
probative value [of the statutorily inadmissible evidence] in the
context of [the] particular case outweighs its prejudicial effect
on the prosecutrix." State v. Howard. 426 A.2d 457 (N.H. 1981).
Judge Souter applied this test in Colbath to find that, under the
facts presented, the defendant had sustained his burden and the
rape shield law must give way to his right to present
potentially-exculpatory evidence.

         In reaching this conclusion, Judge Souter weighed only one
of the rape shield law's purposes -- that of protecting the
privacy of the victim -- against the probative effect of the
defendant's evidence. Finding that the public nature of the
victim's conduct in the bar placed it outside any privacy
interest she might have, he proceeded to discuss at length the
defendant's interest in presenting evidence of the victim's
behavior. At the end of this discussion he concluded summarily
that "little significance can be assigned here to a fear of
misleading the jury," but failed to explain the basis for his
conclusion. Id. at 1217. This failure ignores the second
important purpose of the rape shield law -- to protect against an
assumption by the jury, based on sexual stereotyping, that a
woman who consents to sexual activity with one partner may be

                                                        27
                                     1151

found to have consented to sexual intercourse with the defendant.
By focusing his discussion almost exclusively on the' probative
effect of the defendant's evidence, Judge Souter effectively
assigned no role to, and gave no weight to, the potential for
prejudicial effect on the jury that arises out of such sexual
stereotyping. His apparent lack of understanding of the role
that sexual stereotyping can play in jury deliberations does not
bode well for his assessment of the role it can play in
legislative classifications based on gender that, as a Supreme
Court justice, he will certainly be reguired to review.18 The
Senate must assure that Judge Souter understands the effect of
sex-based stereotyping on legislative judgments, and that such
stereotyping cannot withstand heightened scrutiny under the equal
protection clause's protection against sex discrimination.

         18 See also In Re Opinion of the Justices. 530 A.2d 21
(N.H. 1987). In this case the New Hampshire Supreme Court, at
the request of the legislature, issued an advisory opinion
holding, under a rational basis test, that a proposed law
prohibiting homosexuals from being foster or adoptive parents
would not violate the equal protection clause, although its
application to child care facility operators would violate equal
protection. In upholding the validity of the statute's
application to foster and adoptive parents, the court, including
Judge Souter, based its decision on the stereotypical assumption
that homosexuals are unsuitable parents despite, in the words of
the dissent, "the overwhelming weight of professional study on
the subject [that] concludes that no difference in psychological
and psychosexual development can be discerned between children
raised by heterosexual parents and children raised by homosexual
parents." Id., at 28.

II. JUDGE SOUTER MUST DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO THE
        FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT APPLIES TO
        PREGNANCY AND TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY, AS SHOULD ANY
        NOMINEE CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT

        The long line of cases recognizing a constitutionally-
protected fundamental right to privacy stands for the clear
proposition that decisions affecting marriage, childbirth,
reproductive rights and family relationships are so fundamental
and critical to self-determination that governmental interference
must survive "strict scrutiny" judicial review. Under strict
scrutiny, the government must demonstrate a compelling interest
justifying its interference and that the interest is furthered by
means which are the least restrictive on fundamental rights. The
Supreme Court's application of the right to privacy to pregnancy
and termination of pregnancy, including contraception, assures
that its basic protections are fully available to women, as they
are to men. Any nominee to the Supreme Court must have a
commitment to these core constitutional protections for women
guaranteed by the fundamental right to privacy.

         A. The Supreme court Has Established a Constitutional
                  Right To Privacy That Includes Contraception, Abortion
                  and Pregnancy

         In a line of decisions stretching back more than half a
century, the Supreme Court has recognized that a right of
personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of
privacy, exists under the Constitution. Decisions recognizing a
fundamental privacy interest have forbidden governmental
intrusion into marriage, Loving v. Virginia. 388 U.S. 1, 12

                                                        31
                                   1154

(1967); procreation. Skinner v. Oklahoma. 316 U.S. 535, 541-42
(1942); family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts. 321 U.S.
158, 166 (1944); and child rearing and education, Meyers v.
Nebraska. 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923).

            The leading modern case first recognizing the
constitutional right to privacy in reproductive decisions is
Griswold v. Connecticut. 381 U.S. 479 (1965), in which the Court
held invalid a law prohibiting the sale or use of contraceptives,
even by married couples. In Eisenstadt v. Baird. 405 U.S. 438
(1972), the Court extended this right to unmarried persons and
defined a constitutional right to privacy broad enough to include
"the right of the individual. married or single, to be free from
unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally
affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a
child." IsL_ at 453.

        Against this backdrop, the Court issued its decisions in Roe
v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. In opinions written by Justice
Blackmun, the Court recognized that a woman's fundamental right
to privacy includes the right to abortion, and thus any
governmental interference with that right would be subjected to
strict scrutiny. Under Roe, until the time a fetus is viable, in
the beginning of the third trimester, the only state interest
compelling enough to justify regulation of abortion is protection
of the woman's health. The state's interest in fetal life only
becomes a sufficiently compelling justification to interfere with
a woman's fundamental right when the fetus is viable.

                                                        32
                                  1155

        In Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur. the Supreme
Court relied in part on the fundamental privacy right,
articulated the year before in Roe, to protect pregnant women.
Citing the long line of privacy decisions, the Court held that
"[b]y acting to penalize the pregnant teacher for deciding to
bear a child, overly restrictive maternity leave regulations can
constitute a heavy burden on the exercise of these protected
freedoms." Jd. at 631. Based on this reasoning and fact that the
law created an "irrebutable presumption" of a pregnant woman's
incapacity to teach after her fourth month of pregnancy, the
Court struck down the law. .Id., at 644-48.

         The application of the right to privacy to contraception,
abortion, and pregnancy assures that its basic protections are
available to women as well as men. However, women's right to
privacy based on their unique reproductive capacity is under
serious threat.

         B. The constitutional Privacy Rights of Women Are
                  Threatened

         After Griswold and Roe were decided, the Supreme Court
repeatedly struck down state laws which infringed on women's
privacy rights. For instance, the Court invalidated laws
prohibiting the sale of contraceptives to minors and limiting
their distribution to licensed pharmacists, Carey v. Population
Services International, 431 U.S. £78,-(1977); laws restricting the
availability of unemployment benefits for pregnant women, Turner
v. Department of Employment Services; laws requiring that married
women obtain their husbands' consent to have an abortion, Planned

                                                        33
                                  1156

Parenthood of Central. Missouri v. Danforth. 428 U.S. 52 (1976);
and laws requiring physicians to convey intimidating information
designed to dissuade women from having abortions, Thornburqh v.
ACOG. 476 U.S. 747 (1986).

         However, with the changing composition of the Supreme Court,
the assault on women's privacy rights -- and especially the
strict scrutiny of governmental interference in contraception and
abortion, including minors' access to abortion -- has
intensified.

         The Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services was an unprecedented retreat from the long line
of cases recognizing that contraception and abortion are included
in the fundamental right to privacy, and thus any governmental
interference with these rights must be subjected to strict
scrutiny. The Missouri law at issue in Webster began with a
preamble, which stated the legislature's "findings" that a human
being's life begins at conception, defined as the time of
fertilization; and "unborn children" have protectable interests
in life, health and well-being. The preamble further directed
that the laws of Missouri be interpreted to assure that "unborn
children" have the same rights as all other persons in the state,
within the limits imposed by the United States and Missouri
Constitutions.

         Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for five justices in upholding
the preamble, construing it as merely expressing the state's
value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. Since the

                                                        34
                                    1157

preamble by itself did not restrict the activities of the
plaintiffs, these justices decided that only when Missouri uses
the preamble to restrict an individual's actions would the Court
determine whether the particular restriction was constitutional.

         The four dissenting justices held that an assault on the
fundamental privacy right to contraception and abortion was
inherent in the preamble. According to the dissent, the
preamble's definition of life as beginning at conception and
conception as occurring at the time of fertilization
unconstitutionally interferes with a woman's right to abortion
and to use methods of contraception that can prevent implantation
of the fertilized ovum, including the IUD, the "morning-after"
pill, low-dosage oral contraceptives, and the French-produced
drug RU-486. Id,, at 3068, n.l, 3081. In the wake of Webster,
laws proposed in other states have incorporated the Missouri
definition of when life begins, with potentially devastating
results for reproductive rights.

         The preamble to the Missouri law at issue in Webster was
enacted as part of a comprehensive law placing onerous
restrictions on abortion, including a prohibition on the use of
public facilities broadly defined or employees to perform
abortions, a requirement of specific viability tests for
abortions at twenty weeks of pregnancy, and a prohibition on the
use of public funds for abortion counseling. Besides the

                                                        35
                                    1158

preamble, the Court upheld the prohibition on public funding, and
the viability testing requirement.19

         Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion on these provisions --
joined by Justices White and Kennedy -- did not explicitly
overrule Roe but undermined its foundation, by concluding that
the viability testing requirement is "reasonably designed to
ensure that abortions are not performed when the fetus is viable
-- an end which all concede is legitimate -- and that is
sufficient to sustain its constitutionality." Id. at 3058. This
language suggests the plurality is applying rational basis
review, the standard applied to rights granted only minimal
constitutional protection, not fundamental rights like the right
to privacy. Moreover, the plurality also concluded that there
was no reason that the state's interest in protecting fetal life
should come into existence only at the point of viability,
referring to a "compelling interest" in protecting potential
human life throughout pregnancy, from the moment of conception.
Under this analysis, even if the rights to abortion and
contraception remain in name fundamental rights, strict scrutiny
is satisfied by the state's compelling interest in potential life
from the very beginning of pregnancy and thus, any governmental
interference with the rights could be upheld.

        Justices O'Connor and Scalia did not join this part of the
Court's opinion but for very different reasons. Justice Scalia

         19 The prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion
counseling was dismissed as moot and the Court did not rule on
its constitutional validity.

                                                        36
                                    1159

argued that the plurality's reasoning had covertly overruled Roe,
and denounced the failure to face squarely overruling Roe
explicitly. In her separate opinion, Justice O'Connor argued
that since the testing requirements aided in the determination of
viability, they were within the state's authority under Roe.
Seeing no conflict with Roe, she refused to join in what she saw
as its unnecessary reconsideration. In the past, however,
Justice O'Connor has supported the authority of states to enact
restrictions which do not impose "an undue burden" on the right
to choose, which she appears to define very narrowly to only
include laws which impose "absolute obstacles" or "severe
limitations." Thornburah v. ACOG. 476 U.S. at 828 (O'Connor, J. ,
dissenting). Thus, there are at least four Justices no longer
applying the strict scrutiny protection of the rights to
contraception and abortion included in the fundamental right to
privacy.

         Further, Supreme Court decisions issued last term threaten
the right of young women to abortion through the imposition of
rigid parental notification laws that Justice O'Connor held were
not justifiable even under the minimal rational basis test.
These cases, Hodgson v. Minnesota and Ohio v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, stand in sharp contrast to prior Supreme
Court cases interpreting minors' privacy rights to abortion.
In the 1979 case, Bellotti v. Baird. 443 U.S. 622 (1979)
(Bellotti II), the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts law
requiring a minor to obtain parental consent to her abortion, or

                                                        37
                                    1160

judicial authorization for the procedure but only after notifying
her parents of her decision. The Court declared that a state
could only require parental consent if it provided an alternative
procedure whereby a minor could obtain judicial authorization for
an abortion without parental consultation, either by showing that
she is mature or that an abortion would be in her best interests.
Because the Massachusetts law allowed parents to completely block
a minor's access to abortion by blocking her access to court
authorization, the Court struck down the law. Id., at 647.

         Later Supreme Court cases focused on assuring that laws
restricting minors' access to abortion contained judicial bypass
procedures that complied with the Bellotti II framework. For
example, in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. 4 62
U.S. 416 (1983), Justice Powell, writing for a six-justice
majority, struck down a parental consent law because the City
failed to expressly create the Bellotti II bypass procedure. And
in Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City v. Ashcroft. 462
U.S. 476 (1983), the Court upheld a Missouri parental consent
law, finding that the judicial bypass procedure satisfied the
Bellotti II requirements by assuring a confidential and
expeditious judicial decision.

         However, Hodgson v. Minnesota and Ohio v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health signal a threatening departure from the
Court's previous focus on assuring that minors for whom parental
notification is detrimental or impossible have a viable judicial
alternative. In Hodgson. four members of the Court -- Justices

                                                        38
                                 1161

Kennedy, Rehnquist, Scalia and White --voted to uphold a
Minnesota law requiring two-parent notification without a
judicial bypass procedure, despite the overwhelming evidence that
the law had disastrous effects on young women, especially those
in homes where parents were abusive and in the vast number of
single-parent households, where two-parent consultation was
inappropriate or even impossible. Justice O'Connor voted to
uphold the law, even though she found that it was irrational to
require two-parent notification, as long as there was a judicial
bypass procedure for minors who found parental consultation
impossible, detrimental or inappropriate.

         Thus, there are four justices who are prepared to accept the
absence of any judicial bypass procedure in parental notification
laws, despite the fact that for some young women the judicial
bypass is absolutely critical to their ability to exercise their
right to abortion.

         It is clear that the next appointee to the Supreme Court
will play a pivotal role in determining the continued
constitutional protection of women's fundamental right to
privacy, including the rights to contraception, abortion and
minors' access to abortion. Any nominee must support the
inclusion of these rights in the fundamental right to privacy so
that this core constitutional protection is available to women.

                                                                39

         C. Judge Souter's Record Raises Questions About His
                 Commitment to The Fundamental Right To Privacy In
                 General, and As Applied To Women's Reproductive Rights
                  In Particular

        Although there are limited aspects of Judge Souter's record
which are relevant to the fundamental right to privacy, they
raise serious questions about his commitment to the right and to
strict judicial scrutiny of laws that interfere with it. Judge
Souter's record on abortion is particularly troubling because it
suggests a lack of respect and support for the fundamental nature
of this right. Many of his writings focus on the moral concerns
of those on the periphery of a woman's reproductive decision but
make no mention of the rights of women themselves.

                  1. The Original Intent Theory, as Reflected In Judge
                          Souter's Dissent In Dionne Is Inconsistent With A
                          Constitutional Right To Privacy

        We have discussed Judge Souter's "original intent" theory,
articulated in his dissent in Dionne. and its inconsistency with
the heightened scrutiny standard for sex discrimination under the
equal protection clause. See discussion supra at section I-C-l.
For similar reasons, it is a theory which may leave women and men
without constitutional protection of the fundamental right to
privacy. Because the fundamental right to privacy, including its
application to pregnancy, contraception and abortion was not
explicitly articulated by the framers of the Constitution, an
original intent analysis could suggest no constitutional right to
privacy at all.

                                                                40
                                    1163

        Proponents of original intent argue that the appropriate
forum for the resolution of individual rights that the framers
did not intend to address is the political arena, an arena
unchecked by constitutional protections and guarantees. The
implications for women's privacy rights are severe -- access to
contraception and abortion would depend on where a woman lives or
whether she has sufficient funds to travel to a state with non-
restrictive laws. As our country's history before Roe v. Wade
makes clear, a patchwork of laws restricting women's reproductive
rights would have devastating effects on women's lives.

        Judge Souter must be examined to determine if he would apply
the "original intent" theory to the constitutional right to
privacy, including the protection of pregnancy, contraception and
abortion.20 Any nominee to the Supreme Court must support strict
scrutiny constitutional protection of the fundamental privacy
right generally, and the application of that right to pregnancy
and the termination of pregnancy in particular.

                 When Judge Souter was Attorney General, his office did
assert a constitutional right to privacy in New Hampshire v.
United States. He argued that EEOC regulations requiring
employers to file forms identifying the racial composition of the
workforce violated the employees' right to privacy. This novel
argument was rejected out of hand by every court that considered

                 2. Judge souter's Writings and statements On
                          Reproductive Rights Raise Questions About His
                          Commitment To The Right To Privacy As it Applies
                          To Abortion
                          a. Judge Souter's Concurrence in Smith v. Cote.
                                   And The Majority Opinion He Joined. Reflect A
                                   Distancing From Roe v. Wade That Raises
                                   Concern About His commitment To The Privacy
                                   Right To Abortion

         In Smith v. Cote. 513 A.2d 341 (1986), the New Hampshire
Supreme Court held that a woman could maintain an action against
her obstetrician for failing to test for rubella and to warn her
of possible risks to the fetus resulting from the illness, thus
depriving her of information that would have been relevant to her
decision about whether to continue the pregnancy. The majority
opinion, in which Judge Souter joined, held that physicians who
provide testing and advice relevant to the constitutionally-
guaranteed right have an obligation to adhere to reasonable
standards of professional performance, which include advising
women of information that might lead to abortion. However, in so
ruling the court explicitly distanced itself from the
constitutionally-protected right to abortion articulated in Roe;

                 As we indicated above, we believe that Roe is
         controlling; we do not hold that our decision would
         be the same in its absence.
Id. at 346.

                                                                42
                                     1165

                 Notwithstanding the disparate views within
        society on the controversial practice of abortion,
        we are bound by the law that protects a woman's right to
        choose to terminate her pregnancy. Our holding today
        neither encourages nor discourages this practice . . . .
Id. at 348.

        Not only did Judge Souter join the majority's opinion -- and
its failure to support Roe -- but he also added his own separate
opinion focusing on an issue that the majority stated it did not
address because it was "not raised, briefed or argued in the
record" -- the proper course for physicians who have moral
hesitations about abortion:

        The court does not hold that some or all physicians must
        make a choice between rendering services that they morally
         condemn and leaving their profession in order to escape
         malpractice exposure. The defensive significance, for
         example, of timely disclosure of professional limits based
         on religious or moral scruples, combined with timely
         referral to other physicians who are not so constrained,
         is a question open for consideration in any case in which
         it may be raised.
Id. at 355 (Souter, J., concurring).

His concurring opinion is silent on the rights and concerns of
women. Judge Souter's decision to highlight only the concerns of
doctors with moral qualms about abortion, in a case where it was
clearly unnecessary, is extremely troubling, especially when
coupled with his and the majority's reluctant acceptance of Roe.

                 b. The Brief Filed By Then-Attorney General Souter's
                          Office in coe v. Hooker Reflects a View That The
                          Abortion Rights of Women Mav Be Limited B Y The
                          Moral Objections of Others That Threatens The
                          Privacy Right To Abortion

        Additional evidence of Judge Souter's views of abortion as a

privacy right arises in Coe v. Hooker, a case involving the

obligation of the state to fund abortions for poor women. The

federal district court enjoined enforcement of a state regulation

limiting Medicaid funding of abortions to cases that are

"medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the

woman."21 In arguing against Medicaid funding, the brief of the

Attorney General's office relies in part on the argument that

because "thousands of New Hampshire citizens possess a very

strongly-held and deep-seated belief that abortion is the killing

of unborn children," their strongly held moral belief could

constitutionally interfere with "a women's otherwise unrestricted

freedom to decide to have an abortion." Brief of Appellants at

4I.22 This statement is at odds with a constitutionally-

         21 Judge Souter did not participate in the case at the
trial stage, when the injunction was entered. Coe v. Hooker. 406
F. Supp. 1072 (1976), but was Attorney General at the time the
case was appealed. The name of Souter and one assistant attorney
general appear on the brief. See Appeal of Decision of District
Court of New Hampshire, Brief of Appellants, Coe v. Hooker. No.
75-206 (1st Cir. 1976). The assistant attorney general who argued
Coe has stated that Judge Souter had little knowledge of the
case. See Los Angeles Times (July 31, 1990). This is
inconsistent with other information to the effect that he ran a
"tightly-knit, tightly-run organization." See "Next AG Plans
Little Expansion," Manchester Union Leader (December 28, 1975).
Judge Souter's participation in this brief must be examined.

         22 In Maher v. Roe. 432 U.S. 464 (1977), the United States
Supreme Court held that a state could constitutionally refuse to
fund abortions, not because citizens' moral opposition was
grounds for infringing on the right, but rather as an expression

                                                        44

protected fundamental right to aboriton, for it has never been
held that moral beliefs of the public rise to the level of a
compelling state interest. In fact, the very purpose of a
constitutional fundamental right is to assure that politics and
popular views of the moment cannot infringe on the right.

                 c. Judge Souter's Opposition To Repeal of New
                          Hampshire's Unconstitutional Laws Criminalizing
                          Abortion Using Anti-Abortion Rhetoric Evidences A
                          Lack Of Commitment To The Privacy Right To
                          Abortion

         Judge Souter himself has been quoted as using language
commonly employed by opponents of a constitutionally-protected
right to abortion. In a 1977 newspaper interview, then-Attorney
General Souter in discussing why he opposed a bill that would
fully repeal unconstitutional state laws criminalizing abortion
stated that "[q]uite apart from the fact that I don't think
unlimited abortions ought to be allowed . . . I presume we would
become the abortion mill of the United States."23 The report of
the interview suggests that Judge Souter was concerned about the
possibility that after repeal New Hampshire law would allow
unrestricted post-viability abortions. Id.

         Yet, while expressing concern about the need for
restrictions on post-viability abortion, the interview with then-

of "a value judgment favoring childbirth" which did not infringe
on the basic right. Id. at 474.

23  See "Bill is seen making NH an 'Abortion Mill'",

Manchester (NH) Union Leader. May 19, 1977. Then-Governor

Thomson has reportedly said that he assumes Souter was speaking

for himself, but the reporter who conducted the interview thought

he was speaking on behalf of the Governor. See "Souter Opposed

Unlimited Abortion," Concord Monitor. August 6, 1990.

    45
                                      1168

Attorney General Souter contains no statments from him reflecting
support for the general privacy-based right, even pre-viability.
Nor does the account contain any statement of support for the
Supreme Court decisions which invalidated the state laws at
issue. It is important that Judge Souter's role in the state's
failure to repeal the criminal abortion statutes be explored, to
determine its bearing on his commitment to the privacy-based
right to abortion.

                  d. Judge Souter1s Letter To The New Hampshire
                          Legislature Reflects A Lack Of Understanding About
                          The Significance Of Judicial Bypass To The
                          Exercise Of The Privacy Right To Abortion By
                          Minors

         Finally, a letter that Judge Souter wrote while on the
superior court to the New Hampshire legislature suggests a lack
of commitment to the fundamental privacy rights of women, and
especially young women. The New Hampshire legislature had
pending before it a bill requiring a minor to obtain parental
consent or judicial authorization before she could have an
abortion. At the request of a member of the legislature,24 Judge
Souter wrote expressing the opinion of the court on the bill. He
focused only on the bill's judicial bypass provision, raising the
following objections, among others:

         First, it would express a decision by society, speaking
         through the Legislature, to leave it to individual
         justices of this Court to make fundamental moral decisions
         about the interests of other people without any standards

                 The letter was apparently solicited by a pro-choice
legislator who hoped that the judges would "help kill the bill"
and this in fact is what happened. See "Souter Note Helped Sink
·81 N.H. Bill on Abortion," The Boston Globe. July 26, 1990.

                                    1169

        to guide the individual judge. Judges are professionally
        qualified to apply rules and stated norms, but the provision
        in question would enact no rule to be applied and would
        express no norm.

        The provision that I have quoted from the present bill
        would force the Superior Court to engage in just such acts
        of unfettered personal choice.

Letter, dated May 13, 1981, from Judge Souter to Roma H.
Spaulding, Chairman of the House Committee on Health and Welfare.

        The letter has troubling implications for women's privacy

rights. With four justices on the Supreme Court prepared to

eliminate the judicial bypass procedure in parental notification

laws, Judge Souter's discomfort with judicial involvement in

protecting minors' fundamental rights suggests that he may be the

fifth vote to eliminate the bypass altogether. Yet, the judicial

bypass procedure is an absolutely critical safeguard for many

young women who, without a judicial alternative, could not

exercise their fundamental privacy right to abortion. Moreover,

the letter reveals a very limited vision of the proper judicial

role in protecting the fundamental right to abortion of young

women. According to Judge Souter, because the issue is a

difficult moral one and there may not always exist clear rules
and guidelines, judges should not be involved.25 Judge Souter's

reluctance to involve judicial resources in assuring that minor

                 Judge Souter's complaint that the bill does not provide
adequate standards is without merit. The bill uses the Bellotti
II standard that a judge must determine if a minor is mature or
if an abortion would be in her best interests. These standards
are frequently used by judges in deciding cases involving minors.
In a custody case, Judge Souter had no difficulty in determining
whether an award of custody to the mother or the father would be
"most conducive to [the son's] benefit." See Morin v. City of
Somersworth. 551 A.2d 527 (N.H. 1988).

women have access to .abortion does not bode well for his
willingness to provide strong constitutional protection to
women's fundamental privacy rights.

                                                 * **
         Any nominee to the Supreme Court must support the
fundamental constitutional right to privacy and the application
of the right to women through cases recognizing a fundamental
right to contraception, pregnancy and abortion, including minors'
access to abortion. Judge Souter's record raises serious
concerns about his respect for women's privacy rights that he
must allay during the Senate hearings. Unless these concerns are
allayed, Judge Souter should not be confirmed.

                                                CONCLUSION
        While much of Judge Souter's record has little bearing on
his views of the key constitutional principles of equal
protection and privacy as they apply uniquely to women, there are
disturbing aspects of his record which evidence a lack of
commitment to these core protections. Because they are the two
bedrock constitutional principles protecting women against unjust
government laws and policies directed against them, Judge Souter
should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court unless he can dispel
concerns raised by those disturbing aspects of his record. This
country can ill afford to lose the progress made toward equality
and individual rights and dignity for women during the last
twenty years since the Supreme Court's recognition of the core
principles at issue in this nomination.

                      POSITION PAPER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR OBJECTIVE LAW
ON THE NOMINATION OF DAVID H. SOUTER TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

         Throughout this confirmation process, the focus of almost every organization, no matter
where on the political or jurisprudential spectrum it falls, has been on the question of what David
H. Souter should reveal about his beliefs. Many on the political left have demanded that Judge Souter
state his positions on specific issues, such as abortion. Many on the political right disagree,
maintaining that at most. Judge Souter may properly be asked his position only on broader topics,
such as "privacy" and "judicial activism", they praise Judge Souter as having an "open mind" on
specific issues

         The position of the Association for Objective Law is different Judge Souter must be
questioned probingly on fundamental issues, but the fundamental issues are not issues on the level
of abortion, judicial activism or even privacy. The fundamental and crucial issue is David Souter's
view on individual rights. If David Souter is to be confirmed, he musl have a view on this issue, and
his view must be revealed.

         A nominee for Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States should be asked if his vision
of individual rights is the one on which the United States is grounded. Under this view, rights arise
out of the nature of man; they are not gifts or permissions, and may not be withdrawn for any reason.
They are absolute; no invasion of a right may be justified by "balancing" against a so-called "public
interest" or "government interest." Indeed, the only proper purpose of government, and of laws, is
to BlQlgfi the rights of individuals. This principle is crystallized in the Declaration of Independence:
"To secure these rights, governments are instituted among men. . " For a judge to express and
implement these principles is not "judicial activism." In fact, it is unacceptable for a judge to have
an "open mind" on such principles. They are not optional.

           Statements on narrower, more concrete issues, such as abortion, or the right of privacy, will
of course be revealing. But statements on individual rights as such are infinitely more revealing, as
the hearings on Robert Bork's nomination made chillingly clear. To the extent that a judge is
consistent, his philosophy will determine and make predictable his view on every specific issue
coming before the court. Bork believed that there are no rights, only what the political majority
writes down as permissions. The "majoritarian" principles Bork espoused are fundamentally opposed
to individual rights, and therefore Bork was properly adjudged unfit to serve as a Supreme Court
Justice on the basis of his philosophical approach.

          What is David Souter's philosophy of individual rights? His supporters appear to believe that
confirmation would be doubtful if Judge Souter revealed his views. But for the reasons stated above,
a nominee who refuses to state his fundamental principles should be immediately rejected. Moreover,
majority and dissenting opinions written by Judge Souter as a state court judge raise many questions.
There is more to be seen in these opinions than a passionless, antiseptic, "strict construction" approach
or a hard-line tendency towards criminals. The writings suggest an acceptance of the notion that
rights may be "balanced," and of the notion that rights may be overridden by "public interests." There
is even some suggestion that, like Robert Bork, Judge Souter believes that rights may be voted away
by the majority. See, e.g.. New Hampshire v. Koppel. 499 A.2d 977, 984-85 (1985); Cole v.
Combined Insurance Co. of America. 480 A.2d 178, 180 (1984).

          It is terribly important that David Souter state forthrightly and precisely his view of
individual rights. The fate of our freedom should not be at the mercy of hidden standards.

                                                                         · » ·

DAVID SOUTER'S RECORD ON WOMEN'S LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS:
                                   CAUSE FOR SERIOUS CONCERN

Introduction:
         This report discusses the Senate's role in examining and

confirming Supreme Court nominees, and analyzes Judge David
Souter's record in four key areas of particular concern to women:
constitutional protections against gender discrimination, equal
employment opportunity enforcement measures, rights to privacy
and reproductive freedom, and freedom from crimes of sexual
violence.

         At a minimum, a Supreme Court nominee must demonstrate his
or her adherence to the law's most basic guarantees of individual
rights and equality. After reviewing Judge Souter's record, we
cannot conclude that he subscribes to key constitutional and
legal principles that protect women against discrimination and
guarantee their fundamental rights to privacy and reproductive
freedom. Unless Judge Souter offers adequate assurances of his
commitment to protecting the legal rights of women, we will
oppose his confirmation as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

The Senate has a constitutional obligation and a public
responsibility to examine Supreme Court nominees as to their
views on the Constitution, Individual rights, and the role of the
Court.

        Because of its constitutional mandate to "advise and
consent," the Senate has both the right and the duty carefully to
                                   1177

examine candidates for life tenure on the federal bench. Without
question, this obligation assumes particular significance with
respect to Supreme Court nominees, since at stake is the
composition of "the final arbiter of those issues that most
deeply divide our citizens from one another." Senator Strom
Thurmond underscored the gravity of this duty: "[T]he Supreme
Court has assumed such a powerful role as a policymaker that the
Senate must necessarily be concerned with the views of
prospective Justices or Chief Justices as it relates to broad
issues confronting the American people and the role of the Court
in dealing with these issues."

        Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Committee on
the Judiciary, has carefully chronicled the Senate's historic
willingness to undertake searching inquiry into nominees' views
of the Constitution, individual rights, and the role of the
Supreme Court; such examination has led to the withdrawal,
rejection, or indefinite postponement of nearly one-fifth of all
nominees.

         Moreover, constitutional law scholars urge that this
scrutiny is fundamentally necessary to the preservation of our
constitutional framework. As Professors Phillip Kurland and
Laurence Tribe have written, "The Republic may demand -- and its
Senators ought therefore to assure -- that its life tenured
judiciary does not disdain the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth
Amendment's command for equal protection of the laws and due
process."

        The nomination of David Souter to the Supreme Court thus
calls for the Senate's careful scrutiny of his commitment to
equal protection and individual rights, including constitutional
and legal protections for women. The Senate should require that
Judge Souter resolve any doubts and ambiguities as to his views
on these subjects. Given the Court's critical role in deciding
the most important questions of law and policy, Judge Souter --
as a nominee for lifetime appointment -- must ultimately bear the
burden of establishing his qualifications.

Judge Souter's public record raises serious concerns about his
commitment to protecting the legal rights of women.

        From Assistant Attorney General to Associate Justice for the
state supreme court. Judge Souter has spent the last 22 years as
a public servant; yet his public record on issues of bedrock
importance to women is surprisingly spare. We find it remarkable

                                   1179

that -- over the course of more than two decades as the state's
advocate and jurist -- Judge Souter apparently has published no
speeches, articles, or other writing on pressing issues of law
and policy. Clearly he did not take advantage of the opportunity
afforded him as a public official to promote individual rights
and equal opportunity.

        Consequently, what we know about Judge Souter's fitness to
serve on our highest Court comes only from his judicial opinions
and his actions as state attorney general. This record is
extremely disturbing.

        As discussed below, Judge Souter's record raises serious
questions as to his acceptance of well-established American
jurisprudence, including constitutional and legal protections
against gender-based discrimination, as well as affirmative
measures to redress past abuses. Nor are we convinced that the
nominee recognizes women's constitutional rights to reproductive
freedom and the importance of securing their freedom from crimes
of sexual violence.

        During the confirmation process, we will be looking for
Judge Souter's recognition of a fundamental right to privacy that
encompasses reproductive freedom -- including a woman's right to
choose contraception and abortion. His recognition should
embrace traditional Supreme Court analysis of this privacy
right -- holding that any restrictions on such rights are
constitutionally impermissible unless proved necessary to a
compelling state interest. In any event, he must provide
                                   1180

assurances that he will not dilute the protections now afforded
women by Roe v. Wade.

        Judge Souter must also demonstrate that he is willing to
strike down invidious gender-based classifications as violative
of the Constitution's guarantees of equal protection. He must
affirm his commitment to the law's safeguards of equal employment
opportunity, including affirmative measures proven effective in
battling on-the-job discrimination. And, he must provide
adequate assurances that he will scrupulously uphold the law's
protections against crimes of sexual violence.

        The task before the Senate Judiciary Committee is an urgent
one, as a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court requires the
fullest review. The confirmation process must fill in the gaps
in Judge Souter's record and scrutinize its more troubling
elements. As part of this process, the Senate must ascertain
Judge Souter's position on these issues of our specific concern:
equal protection, employment discrimination, the right to privacy
-- including the right to choose abortion -- and freedom from
crimes of sexual violence. Unless Judge Souter can clarify his
views sufficiently to overcome the disturbing tenor of his
record, he should not be a member of the Supreme Court.

        Our major areas of concern are discussed below.
                                 1181

1. Judge Souter's challenge of the Supreme Court's heightened
         scrutiny standard -- which has often proved successful lri~
         eradicating gender discrimination -- raises serious
         questions as to his willingness to strike down Invidious
         sex-based legal classifications as vlolative of the
         Constitution's equal protection guarantees.

         Over the course of nearly 20 years, the Supreme Court has

consistently held that sex-based classifications require careful

scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection

Clause. The Court recognized that such scrutiny is necessary

since "statutory distinctions between the sexes often have the

effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to

inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities

of its individual members."

                  Thus, the Court has repeatedly ruled that sex-based

classifications are unconstitutional unless they "serve important

governmental objectives [that are] substantially related to
achievement of those objectives."8 This heightened scrutiny has

proved critically important in battling sex discrimination. As

Professor Tribe has noted, "Every law student learns that only

the Supreme Court's development of much more closely structured

             E.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976); Mississippi
University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982).

         7 Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973).

             E.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. at 197. This approach is
known variously as "heightened" or "middle-tier" scrutiny because
it is more rigorous than the "rational-basis" or "minimal"
scrutiny that evaluates legislative enactments with great
deference, requiring only that they be "reasonable." Even more
unyielding, however, is "strict scrutiny," the standard of review
applied by the Court to race-based classifications or
classifications that infringe upon fundamental rights.
                                    1182

forms of scrutiny of laws based on sex and race has led us
predictably toward equality."9

         Constitutional experts agree that "[i]t is clear that when
the Supreme Court struck down sex discrimination in medical
education and in other areas, it has done so only by applying a
more rigorous standard. . . .For a great many years, [the
rational basis test] was in essence the test that led to the
upholding of almost all kinds of sex discrimination." In
fact, "the Supreme Court struck down not one single statute
distinguishing between the sexes in the entire time it applied
[the rational basis] standard to such cases." Under this
minimal standard of review, for example, the Court upheld the
constitutionality of statutes excluding women from jury service,
as well as laws preventing women from working as bartenders or in

                                              12
restaurants late at night.

         In contrast, the Court's development of heightened scrutiny
analysis has proved enormously effective in battling blatant and
harmful discrimination: "The Supreme Court's recognition that
gender discrimination is presumptively wrong has had a
tremendously positive impact on the lives of women in this

country. Under the Court's direction, the federal courts have
invalidated dozens of laws excluding women from wage work and
public life and devaluing the wages and benefits they
receive."

         On at least two occasions, however, Mr. Souter has
questioned heightened scrutiny analysis, preferring the more
deferential rational basis standard (or "minimal scrutiny")
instead. His views cast doubt on his commitment to eradicating
invidious sex-based discrimination.

        As state attorney general, Mr. Souter filed a brief before
the First Circuit Court of Appeals that expressly rejected the
notion that gender-based classifications are subject to
heightened scrutiny. Meloon v. Helgemoe involved a
defendant's equal protection challenge to his conviction under a
statute that held a male criminally liable for sexual intercourse
with an underage female.

         The Souter brief argued that the statute's concededly
gender-based classification should not be subjected to a
distinctly middle-tier level of scrutiny and, therefore, that it
should be allowed to stand. After recounting the development of
the Supreme Court's equal protection jurisprudence, the Souter

Committee on the Judiciary, September 23, 1987.

Hampshire, Meloon v. Helgemoe, 564 F.2d 602, cert, denied 436

                                    1184

brief concluded that sex-based distinctions were entitled to

little more than rational basis scrutiny:

         "The State submits that the Reed-Craig substantial
         relation test is merely a heightened form of the
         traditional rational basis test. It is not an
         independent and median-level standard. Rather, it is a
        creature of the rational basis test, and on a graduated
        scale would fall much closer to that test than to the
        strict scrutiny standard."

        The Court of Appeals ruled against the state and held the

statute unconstitutional. Judge Souter then even more

affirmatively challenged the validity of heightened scrutiny in

petitioning the Supreme Court for certiorari. The Souter

petition urged the Court to reconsider -- and even abandon -- its

standard for evaluating gender-based distinctions:

         "In sum, this Court has created a new equal protection
         test which resides somewhere in the 'twilight zone'
         between the rationale [sic] basis and strict scrutiny
         tests. This new standard lacks definition, shape, or
         precise limits. The instant case is a perfect example
         of what Justice Rehnquist feared most - the abuse of a
         standard so 'diaphanous and elastic1 as to permit
         subjective judicial preferences and prejudices
         concerning particular legislation. The instant case
         represents an opportunity for the Court to define,16
         shape, limit, or even eliminate the new standard."

         As a judge, Souter has not had an opportunity to rule on a

gender-based equal protection challenge. But, just a few months

ago. Judge Souter again expressed difficulty with middle-tier

scrutiny, albeit in a context other than that of sex

discrimination. City of Dover v. Imperial Casualty & Indemnity

Co. applied the state's middle-tier level of review to

evaluate the constitutionality of a municipal immunity statute.

Dissenting from the majority's holding of unconstitutionality.

Judge Souter argued that the majority had misapplied the state's

middle-tier scrutiny, in that it had not been sufficiently

deferential to the legislature's classification. In his

discussion of the standard, Souter argued that it

         "suffers from a proven susceptibility to confusion with
         other standards of equal protection review . . . .
        Although the federal judiciary, like this court, has
         subsequently tried to use Royster's formulation to
         provide 'somewhat heightened1 middle tier scrutiny, the
         very opinions cited in Carson as so applying it have
         reverted to type, as. it were, by lapsing into rational
         basis terminology."

Judge Souter's dissent thus echoed his earlier brief in

suggesting that middle-tier scrutiny is really little more than

minimal scrutiny, and intimating that a distinctly articulated

middle-tier review is difficult, if not impossible, to apply.

         18 Id. at 24-25 (citations omitted).

              However, in an earlier decision. Judge Souter noted
federal courts' use of heightened scrutiny to evaluate
discriminatory statutes. In rejecting an equal protection
challenge to a statute limiting the deposition discovery rights
of defendants accused of crimes against victims under sixteen
years of age, Souter wrote that "the distinction in question does
not rest on gender or legitimacy as to entitle the defendant to
heightened scrutiny under the federal standard." State v. Heath,
523 A.2d 82, 88 (1986).

         Since Judge Souter had no opportunity to evaluate a sex
discrimination claim as a judge, we are unable to conclude
whether this mention of heightened scrutiny demonstrates his
acceptance of the analysis as necessary in eliminating
discrimination, or mere recitation of existing federal precedent.

                                    1186

        As the state's advocate. Judge Souter's willingness to have
gender-based classifications reviewed under merely "a creature of
the rational basis test" alarms us. Even more unsettling was his
suggestion that the Court retreat from heightened scrutiny of
such distinctions. His recent expression of judicial discomfort
with the difficulty in applying middle-tier review does nothing
to dispel these concerns.

         Judge Souter's record thus gives us reason to doubt his
willingness to apply the Court's equal protection jurisprudence
in this critical area -- and, consequently, his readiness to
invalidate statutes that discriminate on the basis of sex. His
writings suggest that he might evaluate classifications by gender
with little more than rational basis scrutiny -- a standard
clearly inadequate for uprooting invidious discrimination. As
history has taught us all too painfully, courts have used the
lesser rational basis test to uphold gender-based distinctions
that disable women from full participation in political,
business, and economic arenas.

        The Senate must further inquire into Judge Souter's
willingness to strike down gender-based distinctions as violative
of constitutional guarantees of equal protection. Absent his

Nor are we able to analyze how he would actually undertake equal
protection review of sex-based classifications -- i.e., whether
his evaluation of such classifications, even if in the name of
heightened scrutiny, would prove rigorous or deferential. For
these reasons. Judge Souter's dicta in Heath offers us little
guidance.

                                    1187

firm commitment to eliminating invidious sex-based
classifications, Judge Souter should not be confirmed.

2. As state attorney general, Judge Souter actively opposed
         measures designed to enforce guarantees of equal employment
         opportunities7 in challenging Equal Employment Opportunity
         Commission regulations, MrT Souter's arguments revealed a
         fundamental misapprehension of Title VII and the role of the
         EEOC in achieving equal employment opportunity.
         Although Mr. Souter -- as Attorney General -- appeared as

counsel on all briefs filed by the state, they were often
actually prepared by one of his Assistant Attorneys General.
Nevertheless, Mr. Souter bore ultimate responsibility for the
state's arguments. As Souter himself remarked, "At no time would
I give testimony with which I disagree. And it would be
irresponsible for the attorney general to support any state
agency if he felt what they were doing was clearly wrong."20

         Moreover, Souter was reluctant to expand the size of his
relatively small staff for fear of relinquishing some measure of
control: "I'm probably going to surprise you but I don't think
it should be expanded. . . .1 personally don't want to see [the
staff] get any bigger than it has to be. When you talk about 20
or 30 lawyers, you talk about independent judgment. It can't be
a tightly-knit, tightly-run organization."21 Thus, it can be

assumed that Mr. Souter was personally involved in developing the

arguments in his office's major cases, especially those prepared

for the Supreme Court.

         This seems especially true when, as state attorney general,

Mr. Souter challenged Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

regulations that required states to submit reports listing their

                                                                                                                     22

employees' race, national origin, and sex by job category.

New Hampshire was the only state during that period to balk at

the EEOC's requirements, which, properly interpreted, can be used

to determine the possibility of Title VII violations. Then-

Solicitor General Robert Bork defended the reasonableness of the

regulations against Mr. Souter's challenge.

         Mr. Souter's petition for certiorari to the Court argued

that the recordkeeping requirements forced employers to "become

                                                                                   23

color-conscious rather than color-blind," thus violating

          22

              Interviews with others involved in New Hampshire's
challenge of the EEOC regulations further suggest that Judge
Souter endorsed the state's arguments. Edward Haffer, the
Assistant Attorney General whose name appears on the briefs along
with that of Mr. Souter, remembers that Souter was "supportive of
and involved in the effort." Legal Times, Aug. 27, 1990, at 10.
Moreover, then-New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson recently
recalled that Souter "did not discourage" pursuing the case all
the way to the Supreme Court. "Souter, as State Offical, Opposed
U.S. Racial Breakdown Rule," Washington Post, Aug. 1, 1990 at A4.

        23 Petition for Writ of Certiorari for the State of New
Hampshire at 7-8, New Hampshire v. United States, (1976) (No. 76-
453).

         Interestingly, Mr. Souter's cert petition also urged that
the EEOC regulations violated employees' constitutional right of
privacy. The brief argued that "the right to refuse to inform
the government of one's racial/ethnic background" was "a matter
of individual privacy." Id. at 15. Whether Judge Souter's

                                    1189

constitutional and Title VII principles. While offering no
supporting evidence, the state maintained that employment quotas
would be the "natural consequence" of keeping information on
employees' race and sex -- even though the creation of such
quotas would constitute a violation of Title VII.

        Mr. Souter's argument reveals a fundamental misapprehension
of the purposes underlying Title VII and the role of the EEOC in
achieving equal employment opportunity. As the Supreme Court has
recognized, one of Title VII's objectives is to serve as a
catalyst for encouraging employers to examine their own practices

                                                                                                                   24

to eliminate unlawful sex- and race-based discrimination.
And, as civil rights experts such as Bush appointee and EEOC
chair Evan Kemp agree, this recordkeeping is necessary in
evaluating possible cases of discrimination and in measuring
progress in attaining equal employment opportunity. Requiring
employers to track the diversity of their workforce is a
reasonable and effective enforcement measure fully in keeping
with the EEOC's regulatory authority.

        Over the past 25 years. Title VII has facilitated the slow
but steady progress of women and people of color in achieving
equal opportunity in the workplace. But its continued
effectiveness hinges largely upon courts1 enthusiasm for
demands the Senate's further investigation. See Section 3,
infra.

enforcing it. Judge Souter's assault on the EEOC's sensible
recordkeeping requirements, coupled with his reported
characterization of "affirmative action" measures as "affirmative

                                26

discrimination," casts doubt on his understanding of and
dedication to equal employment opportunity law.

         The Senate must further examine Judge Souter's commitment to
constitutional and legal protections against employment
discrimination -- including affirmative efforts proven effective
in translating the dream of equal opportunity into reality for
women, especially women of color. Unless he makes clear his
willingness to enforce these crucial laws and regulations, he
should not be confirmed.

3. Judge Souter's record falls to demonstrate a commitment to
        protecting women's fundamental right to reproductive
         freedom, Including the right to choose abortion.
        A woman's ability to enjoy the full range of personal

liberties guaranteed by the Constitution -- her privacy and her
equality before the law -- hinges upon her freedom to choose when
and whether to have a child. Judge Souter's position on this
most fundamental of women's rights remains unclear. In a number
of instances, however, he has taken positions that lead us to
question his support of a woman's right to choose.

        For example, in a 1977 interview, then-Attorney General
Souter expressed opposition to legislative efforts to repeal the
state's 19th-century laws criminalizing the performance of
abortion -- despite the fact that the laws' enforcement had
already been enjoined as unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade. Mr.
Souter was apparently worried that repeal would leave the state
with no ban on abortion at all, even though Roe allowed state-
imposed restrictions after viability. Although less than one
percent of all abortions are performed in the third trimester,
Mr. Souter feared that

         "Quite apart from the fact that I don't think unlimited
         abortions ought to be allowed, if the state of New
        Hampshire left the situation as it is now [by enacting
         the repeal], I presume that we would^become the
         abortion mill of the United States."
        Mr. Souter went on to announce that "[n]ow that this bill
has been received by the [state] Senate Judiciary Committee, I'm
going to address that committee and advise we had better sit down
and talk about this and decide what is to be done." Even if Mr.
Souter's concern was based on a sincere desire to limit post-
viability abortion, his opposition to the repeal of legislation
that clearly violated the constitutional rights of women is
troubling. As the state's top law enforcement officer dedicated
to upholding both state and federal constitutions, we would
expect Mr. Souter to have worked to modify the laws consistent

with constitutional protections as outlined in Roe. The Senate
should carefully explore Mr. Souter's position in this matter,
inquiring as to any actual efforts he undertook to ensure that
New Hampshire law complied with the constitutional requirements
of Roe.

         In 1981, on behalf of the state Superior Court, Judge Souter
wrote a letter to New Hampshire's state legislature in opposition
to a judicial bypass provision in a pending bill that would have
required a minor to secure parental consent before obtaining an
abortion. Expressly taking no position on whether parental
consent should be required at all, the letter objected to a
provision that would require a Superior Court justice to
authorize a minor's abortion when in her best interest.

         Judge Souter objected on two grounds: he felt that the
provision would force judges to make fundamentally moral
decisions without any standards for guidance; and he felt that
the bypass provision would prove difficult for judges who
believed that abortion was morally wrong or who felt unable to
pass on the minor's best interests -- thus obligating them to
refuse to authorize the minor's request for an abortion.

         Judge Souter's views raise concern, even though he
apparently wrote at the request of a pro-choice advocate. His
criticism of judicial authorization runs counter to the Court's
1979 decision in Bellotti v. Baird.29 There the Court
invalidated a law that required a minor to notify her parents of

        29 443 U.S. 622 (1979).
                                                        17

her plans for an abortion; absent their consent, she could then
seek judicial authorization. The Court objected, inter alia, to
the statute's failure to offer a minor the opportunity to get an
independent judicial determination that she was mature enough to
make the abortion decision herself or that an abortion would be
in her best interests. Souter's obvious distaste for such
judicial determination invites inquiry into whether he would vote
to overrule Bellotti's requirement of a judicial bypass mechanism
and to prohibit altogether minors' access to abortion absent
parental consent.

        More recent Supreme Court decisions have upheld certain
parental consent and parental notification statutes so long as
they allowed for a judicial bypass provision. Souter's expressed
discomfort with judicial authorization of a minor's abortion,
coupled with his silence on the parental consent question
generally, leads us to wonder under what circumstances he would
uphold and protect a minor's constitutional right to obtain an
abortion at all.

         Judge Souter's recent special concurrence to the New

                                                                                                       30

Hampshire Supreme Court's decision in Smith v. Cote did
nothing to dispel these concerns. There, the majority found a
doctor negligent for his failure to test a pregnant woman for
rubella and to warn her of possible risk to a fetus exposed to
rubella, thereby depriving her of information on which she would
have had an abortion. Souter wrote separately to raise an issue

         30 513 A.2d 341, 355-56 (1986).
                                                  18

not before the Court -- discussing how a doctor who opposed

abortion might discharge his or her professional obligations in

such a situation. In so doing, he referred to abortion only

as "a sphere of medical practice necessarily permitted under Roe

v. Wade." He entirely failed to discuss Roe's recognition of the

right to choose as a fundamental liberty grounded in the
Constitution itself.32

         As was the case in his earlier letter to the state

legislature. Judge Souter voiced concern for the rights of those

who oppose abortion while remaining silent as to constitutional

protections of women's reproductive freedom. On two separate

occasions, he has abandoned his normal reticence out of distress

for the professional hardships faced by anti-choice judges and

doctors; he has yet to speak to the burdens faced by women

struggling with the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy.

         Judge Souter's commitment to protecting women's reproductive

freedom remains entirely unclear. Because of the critical

              Indeed, the majority opinion remarked on Judge Souter's
decision to discuss an issue not before the court: "We do not
reach the issue raised in the special concurrence of Souter, J.,
because it has not been raised, briefed, or argued in the record
before us." 513 A.2d at 355.

              Id. The majority opinion, in which Judge Souter joined,
also refused to reaffirm the right to choose as constitutionally
based. Instead, it framed its decision as mandated by binding
federal precedent, rather than compelled by the Constitution:
""The basic social and constitutional issue underlying this case
thus has been resolved [by Roe]; we need not cover ground already
traveled by a court whose interpretation of the National
Constitution binds us. . . .As we indicated above, we believe
that Roe is controlling; we do not hold that our decision would
be the same in its absence." 513 A.2d at 344, 346.

importance of this issue, the Senate must probe for a more
complete articulation of his views. And, unless he acknowledges
a fundamental right to privacy under the Constitution --
providing assurances that he will not dilute the protections of
this right now afforded women by Roe v. Wade -- he should not be
confirmed.

4. Judge Souter's record -- w h i c h Illustrates his failure to
         grasp the significance of rape shield laws In prosecuting
         and deterring rape --does not demonstrate a commitment to
         enforce legal protections against rape.
         Forty-six states and the U.S. Congress have enacted rape

shield laws that bar evidence of a rape victim's prior sexual
behavior with persons other than the defendant. Rape shield laws
serve two important purposes: they prohibit using rape victims'
private sexual lives as a means of courtroom harassment and
intimidation; and they protect a woman's freedom to decide
whether, when, and with whom she chooses to have sex by
recognizing that her sexual behavior with others is entirely
irrelevant to whether she consented to sex with the defendant.

        Judge Souter's reversal of a rape conviction in State v.
Colbath is especially troubling in its misconception of the
law's protections against sexual violence, in Colbath, Souter
ruled that the complainant's sexual behavior with men other than
the defendant could be relevant to the issue of consent, holding

        33 540 A.2d 1212 (1988) .
                                                 20
                                     1196

that the state's rape shield law did not preclude the admission

of such evidence.

           In ruling that the complainant's public behavior with

others was probative as to her consent to sex with the defendant.

Judge Souter ignored a primary purpose underlying rape shield

laws. His reasoning suggests that a woman's consensual behavior

with one person robs her of the ability to decline sex with

another.

         Judge Souter's opinion is no less disturbing for its

adoption of the defendant's version of the facts over that of the

prosecution:
         M[T]he two of them left the tavern and went to the
         defendant's trailer. It is undisputed that sexual
         intercourse followed; forcible according to the
         complainant, consensual according to the defendant. In
         any case, before they left the trailer the two of them
         were joined unexpectedly by a young woman who lived
         with the defendant, who came home at an unusual hour
         suspecting that the defendant was indulging in
         faithless behavior. With her suspicion confirmed, she
         became enraged, kicked the trailer door open and went
         for the complainant, whom she assaulted violently and
         dragged outside by the hair. It took the intervention
         of the defendant and a third woman to bring the melee
         to an end."

Nowhere does Judge Souter attribute this narrative to the

defense, nor does he mention the woman's very different version

of events (that she was injured not by a jealous girlfriend, but

by the defendant during a violent rape). Judge Souter thus

       34 540 A.2d a t 1212-13.
        35 Compare Judge Souter's opinion in State v. Colbath, 540
A.2d at 1212-13 with Brief for the State of New Hampshire, State
v. Colbath at 3-5 (No. 86-390).

                                                        21
                                    1197

seemed to adopt the defense's version as his own, without
indicating that the facts were in dispute.

        Given Judge Souter's record of ruling in favor of the
prosecution in an overwhelming majority of criminal cases, his
apparent readiness to adopt the defendant's version of events in
this case is troubling. His opinion's concluding paragraphs
further suggest a belief that women are wont to fabricate rape
charges: he found that the victim could have "allege[d] rape as
a way to explain her injuries and excuse her undignified

                               37

predicament." Two separate juries did not so find, making
Judge Souter's speculation as to the victim's credibility all the
more distressing-

         Rape is a crime to which women are especially vulnerable;
its constant threat limits their freedom and forces them to live
in fear for their personal safety; its aftermath can be
physically and psychologically devastating. Judge Souter's
failure to grasp the significance of rape shield laws in
prosecuting -- and thus deterring -- rape triggers our concern.

         Again, the Senate must thoroughly explore Judge Souter's
views on the prosecution of rape and the law's treatment of rape
victims. Unless he fully articulates a firm commitment to the
law's protections against crimes of sexual violence, he should
not be confirmed.

              A review by the National Association of Criminal Defense
Attorneys found that Judge Souter ruled in favor of the
prosecution in all but five of 75 criminal cases.

          37 540 A.2d at 1217-
                                                        22

Conclusion
         Judge Souter's record fails to demonstrate a commitment to

constitutional and legal guarantees of freedom and equality for
women; moreover, he has at times affirmatively challenged
constitutional analyses and enforcement tools that are essential
in fighting sex discrimination.

        The Constitution requires and the public interest demands
that the Senate carefully examine Judge Souter's views on equal
protection and individual rights -- those most important
protections largely dependent upon the Court for their continued
preservation. Thus, unless Judge Souter can further articulate
his positions in these areas -- including equal protection,
employment discrimination, privacy rights that encompass the
right to choose contraception and abortion, and freedom from
crimes of sexual violence -- he does not meet the minimum
standards for a seat on our nation's highest Court. Absent a
coherent and convincing discussion of Judge Souter's commitment
to upholding these protections, we will urge the Senate to reject
his nomination.
