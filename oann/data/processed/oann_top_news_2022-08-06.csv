The county fired its elections director, David Frisk, after a series of debacles left voters outraged. Frisk was let go on Thursday and replaced by Pinal County Recorder Virginia Ross.Election officials said they are embarrassed that over 20 precincts in the county had run low or ran out of in-person ballots during Tuesday’s primary elections. Although no official cause of the shortage has been given, high demand and printing errors have been suggested as possible factors.“I’m not entirely sure how the ballot shortage happened,” stated county official Jeffrey McClure. “We opened the boxes, there weren’t enough ballots, so we’re not really quite sure how that occurred.Republican ballots were in great shortage at voting centers by early afternoon.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:39 AM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022Basketball star Brittney Griner was found guilty and now faces a lengthy prison sentence in Russia. The US citizen was arrested roughly six months ago after being caught with vape cartridges containing cannabis oil at a Moscow airport. Griner was guilty on drug smuggling and possession charges.The two-time Olympic gold medalist pleaded with the judge for leniency ahead of the court’s decision in a last ditch effort to regain her freedom. Nonetheless, Russia officials have been keen it their belief that Griner violated Russian law and should be judged accordingly.“My parents taught me two important things,” she stated. “One: take ownership for your responsibilities. And two: work hard for everything that you have. That’s why I pled guilty to my charges. I understand everything that has been said against me, the charges that are against me, and that is why I pled guilty. But I had no intent to break any Russian laws. I made an honest mistake and I hope that, in your ruling, that it doesn’t end my life here.”Back home in the states, Griner had been prescribed medical marijuana for pain from chronic injuries. This is reportedly a common treatment for professional athletes on part of its mild side effects in comparison to most prescribed painkillers.Breaking: Brittney Griner was found guilty of drug possession and smuggling in a Russian court outside Moscow.

The Biden administration reportedly plans to exchange two Americans arrested in Russia for a weapons trafficker imprisoned in the US. According to reports, Biden’s officials have offered Russia to exchange arms-dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner who are facing legal trouble in Moscow. The report cited three unnamed sources, who claimed Biden has personally approved that plan.Bout has been imprisoned in the US on arms-trafficking charges since 2011 and is serving a 25-year term. Meanwhile, Whelan was previously convicted of espionage charges back in 2020.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said his department has discussed the matter with Russian diplomats directly. He added, he hopes to reach an understanding. In the meantime, President Biden is under immense pressure to bring home Americans detained in Russia.","WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner sits in a cage at a court room prior to a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, July 27, 2022.

That’s according to two people familiar with the matter said. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:35 PM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022The Biden administration declared Monkeypox a public health emergency. In a press briefing Thursday, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra called on Americans to take Monkeypox seriously as the US posted more than 7,000 cases. The disease has been spreading in the US since May and cases are expected to continue to rise.In light of evolving circumstances on the ground, I am declaring a public health emergency on #monkeypox. We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus. We urge every American to take monkeypox seriously.— Secretary Xavier Becerra (@SecBecerra) August 4, 2022He added that the emergency designation allows the government to accelerate the distribution of Monkeypox vaccines. The Biden administration also appointed FEMA officials to coordinate the Moneypox response. This comes after California, New York and Illinois designated Monkeypox a health emergency which prompted calls to do the same on the federal level. A public health emergency opens up funding for disease response and could help accelerate access to existing treatments for the painful disease. Monkeypox vaccines already exist and are in use around the country, but they’re still in short supply.The declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that Monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.”“This public health emergency will allow us to explore different strategies to get vaccines and treatments more quickly out to impacted communities and it will allow us to get more data from jurisdictions so we can effectively track and attack this outbreak,” stated Robert Fenton, White House national Monkeypox response coordinator.The Administration has announced a four-part strategy to combat monkeypox, including:– Scaling production and distribution of vaccines– Making testing more convenient– Expanding access to treatments– Empowering communities impacted or at risk of contracting the virus— The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 4, 2022HHS recently said it’s adding 800,000 doses of Monkeypox vaccines to its stockpile amid calls for mass-vaccination for Monkeypox among the gay circles. Monkeypox causes a rash and lesions along with symptoms like fevers and swollen lymph nodes. It does not spread as easily as COVID-19 and so far experts think it is primarily transmitted through close person-to-person contact.Most cases have appeared among men who have sex with men, though people outside that group have also tested positive for the infection.","FILE – Daniel Rofin, 41, receives a vaccine against Monkeypox from a health professional in medical center in Barcelona, Spain, July 26, 2022.

The Secretary stressed that any military action by China would not benefit anybody in the region, including the communist nation itself.“Nothing has changed about our position and I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity,” said Blinken. “We and countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one, and could have unintended consequences that serve no one’s interests including ASEAN members and including China.”I join my fellow G7 foreign ministers in reaffirming our shared commitment to maintaining the rules-based international order, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and beyond. https://t.co/jNk62NM1Dw— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) August 3, 2022Blinken also made it publicly known that the US has directly conveyed its position on Taiwan to the Chinese government.","US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken addresses the media during a press conference in Berlin, Germany, Friday, June 24, 2022.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File PhotoOAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:21 PM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022New York officials are calling for tougher measures to deter recidivism in the city amid rising crime rates. During a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell called for changes to the bail system to make it easier to keep repeat offenders behind bars.“This is not attacking some of the needed reforms that we have,” Adams said. “This is about a small number of people that are taking advantage of the existing laws to endanger our city.”According to officials, the number of individuals arrested three or more times in a calendar year for crimes such as robbery, burglary and grand larceny has increased through the first six months of 2022. Sewell said repeat offenders have been shown their criminal behavior has no consequences as they’ve been through the system on several occasions.“We are seeing tragedies every day on the streets of this city we love and serve,” voiced Sewell. “People are suffering and more and more are unnecessarily becoming victims. Victims of repeat offenders who have shown that their criminal behavior is given no consequences.”Join me and @NYPDPC Sewell at 1 Police Plaza for an announcement. https://t.co/2P8wBhyJ0d— Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) August 3, 2022Bail reform advocates are not ready to abandon their cause and maintain that the changes that took effect in 2020 should stay on the books.“Let’s not tell New Yorkers all we’ve got to do is to lock up the black and brown people who are the children of the parents we locked up 20 years ago,” Public Advocate Jumaane Williams stated. “That’s not leadership and on top of that you want to lock them up on Riker’s Island, where people are dying on a regular basis waiting for their trial.”Adams, Sewell and law enforcement officials are frustrated by the laws and claimed suspects like Gooding prove their point about the need to fix bail reform. Gooding, 53, who’s also known as Jamel White, served prison time for robbery and burglary convictions in Brooklyn, said police sources. His career of 101 arrests includes 88 busts since the bail laws took effect. Police sources said Gooding has 15 criminal convictions, including two for violent felonies, one for a non-violent felony and 10 for misdemeanors. Sources said Gooding has skipped court hearings at least 14 times.Those on the NYPD’s top 10 recidivist list have between them been arrested 485 times since the bail reform laws took effect. Those 485 arrests amount to 75 percent of the suspects total histories of 642 arrests, the police numbers show. Officials also argued that judges must be allowed to consider the public safety threat a suspect poses when determining if they will be held in pre-trial custody.","FILE PHOTO: New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a news conference about recent shootings of homeless people in both New York and Washington, at the John A.

Ron DeSantis gestures as he speaks during a news conference Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, in Tampa, Fla. DeSantis announced that he was suspending State Attorney Andrew Warren, of the 13th Judicial Circuit, due to “neglect of duty.” (AP Photo/Chris O’Meara)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:17M PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022In a major announcement, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) said he’s suspending Democrat State Attorney Andrew Warren. During a press conference Thursday, DeSantis said Warren has continued to ignore the law and his suspension is effective immediately.DeSantis said crime has spiked under the 13th Judicial Circuit in Hillsborough County because prosecutor Warren picks and choosea what laws to enforce based on his personal agenda. Warren recently signed a joint letter promising to avoid prosecuting people for providing or seeking abortions. The letter was published in June by the organization Fair and Just Prosecution, which bills itself as bringing together elected local prosecutors to promote “a justice system grounded in fairness, equity, compassion and fiscal responsibility.”“The role of the state attorney is to apply the law and enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don’t like,” DeSantis said. “This is a law and order state. We’re not going to back down from that one inch. We’re not going to allow locally-elected people to veto what our state has decreed through our legislative process. When you’re saying you’re not going to enforce certain laws that you don’t like, that’s neglect of duty that quite frankly is incompetence as defined in Florida law.”Warren signed the letter along with more than 90 prosecutors from various states, some of which have enacted limitations on abortion similar to the Florida measure. The Florida Legislature passed the 15-week abortion restriction this spring, and DeSantis signed it in April. Providers could face third-degree felony charges for breaking the law.“Not all of us agree on a personal or moral level on the issue of abortion. But we stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,” the June 24 letter said. “As such, we decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.”Prosecutors have a duty to enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws they agree with.

While the White House touted the strike on ”Al-Qaeda” leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri at a compound in Afghanistan, Republicans said its only indicative of Afghanistan being a hotspot for terrorists in the region. In a press conference Tuesday, White House National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby asserted the White House ”met its commitment” in regards to controlling terrorist activity in the country.“As President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans, to the homeland,” said Kirby. “We met that commitment. This action demonstrates that without American forces on the ground in Afghanistan and in harm’s way, we still remain able to identify and locate even the world’s most wanted terrorist and then take the action to remove him from the battlefield.”National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan added onto Kirby’s statement and said Al-Zawahiri’s death has “undoubtedly made the United States safer.” Sullivan noted that the killing of the terrorist justified Biden’s’ withdrawal from Afghanistan last year and asserted that the US no longer needed to keep thousands of troops there.“He was the man who was the most inspirational figure, the strategic leader, someone who sent guidance regularly to affiliates around the world,” Sullivan voiced. “Someone who sent out messages inspiring his followers to attack and kill Americans and harm the United States. Someone who tried to hold together a global network of terrorists that could continue to threaten both America and Americans and taking him out has undoubtedly made the United States safer.”On July 1, President Biden meets with his national security team to discuss the counterterrorism operation to take out Ayman al-Zawahiri. At this meeting, the President was briefed on the proposed operation and shown a model of the safe house where Al-Zawahiri was hiding. pic.twitter.com/W0A0mDk9Lr— The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 2, 2022The White House’s sentiments contrast those of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who pointed to the fact that Al-Zawahri felt safe enough to stay in Kabul and showed the US lack of control of terrorist activities in Afghanistan.“I want to focus for a minute on the successful strike against Al-Zawahri,” McConnell stated. “Our professionals did an extraordinary job. Congratulations to them, but I think it’s also important to remember that about a year ago, we pulled out of Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban was out of power and Al-Qaeda was not around. So it is noteworthy where Al-Zawahiri was in Kabul. So Al-Qaeda is back as a result of the Taliban being back in power and describing the current situation in Afghanistan as success is utterly absurd.”The targeted CIA attack raised questions about the presence of Al-Qaeda which was supposedly purged from the country. There were many questioning whether the Taliban was providing refuge to the group behind numerous attacks against America, including 9-1-1.Al-Zawarhiri was accused of planning the September 11 attacks as well other bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990’s, among other attacks.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Biden Admin.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called out the progressive left at this years CPAC after he was welcomed to CPAC with a standing ovation. Speaking at the event on Thursday, Orban accused progressive liberals of trying to silence him and attempting to keep him away from the event.“They did not want me to be here and they made every effort to drive a wedge between us,” said Orban. “They hate me and slander me and my country as they hate you and slander you and the America you stand for. We all know how this works. Progressive liberals didn’t want me to be here because they knew what I would tell you. Because I’m here to tell you that we should unite our forces.”He then went on to suggest that today’s progressive left is equivalent to Nazi’s and communist dictators by trying to move the US away from Judeo-Christian values. Orban, who came to power in 2010, has increasingly clamped down on political opposition and press freedom, consolidating his power further over the last two elections.  During his speech, Orbán also attacked Jewish billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, “globalists” and the Democratic Party. He went on to voice, “They hate me and slander me and my country, as they hate you.”“The horrors of Nazis and communism happened because some western states in continental Europe abandoned their Christian values,” he voiced. “Today’s progressives are planning to do the same. They want to give up on western values and create a new world, a post-western world.

Speaking to the media from the White House Friday, Biden appeared optimistic about securing her release.“We call on President Biden and the United States government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement.President Joe Biden released the following statement after a Russian court sentenced Brittney Griner to nine years in prison: pic.twitter.com/wxDCbaaQBe— ESPN (@espn) August 4, 2022The 31-year-old athlete was found guilty of bringing vape cartridges containing cannabis oil into Russia in February. Her sentencing could now pave the way for a prisoner swap between Griner and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in Illinois. The result is a painful quandary for the Biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over his war in Ukraine.“There’s nothing good here,” said Andrea Schneider, an expert on international conflict resolution at Cardozo School of Law. “No matter what Biden does, he’s going to be criticized. Either that we’re giving too much or we’re not working hard enough.”Brittney Griner being sentenced to 9 years in jail over cannabis is egregious.@POTUS must do everything in his power to get her back to the US.He also must correct that injustice here in America, too. Far too many people are locked up over non-violent drug offenses.— Nina Turner (@ninaturner) August 4, 2022Kremlin officials said that any potential deal could not proceed before her trial was complete, creating a glimmer of hope that the verdict might open the door for an exchange. But analysts called that unlikely anytime soon.“I don’t think this is going to get resolved quickly,” said Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer who represents Americans held by foreign governments. “I think the fact that Putin has not said yes right away means that he’s looked at the US offer and said, ‘Well, that’s their first offer. I can get more than that.’”That US offer first presented to Russia in June. They sought the release of Ms. Griner and Paul N. Whelan, a former Marine arrested in Moscow and convicted of espionage in 2020.","WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:14 AM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022The Biden administration has paired up with Big Business to promote its latest social spending bill. The President said a Democrat-backed spending binge will combat inflation, but hundreds of economists disagree.On Thursday, Joe Biden held a virtual conference with representatives of large businesses and labor unions to promote his so-called Inflation Reduction Act. He claimed the mega corporations had American families’ best interests at heart by putting their weight behind the bill. The Delaware native touted the multiple ways he alleged Americans will save money from health care to effects from the so-called climate crisis.“The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug prices, lowers health insurance premiums, invests in clean energy that will create jobs and economic opportunities for business and labor, reduces the deficit, and makes common sense reforms to our corporate tax code,” claimed the President. “These are the facts”.Biden praised the bill in tandem with the recently passed CHIPS Act, which the Democrat proclaimed would bolster clean energy investments and American manufacturing.“They see how already because of our work over the last 18 months, American manufacturing is coming back stronger than ever,” he stated. “Where is it written that America can’t lead the manufacturing in the world? Six-hundred, thirteen-thousand manufacturing jobs created just since I took office, the most created in three decade.”When we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, working families will get rebates to buy efficient appliances and weatherize their homes. And folks will have tax credits for efficient heating and cooling and rooftop solar.Families will see their energy bills drop by the hundreds.— President Biden (@POTUS) August 5, 2022However, analysts are less optimistic about the bill than Mr. Biden. Two-hundred, thirty economists penned a letter to House and Senate leadership warning the spending package will serve as gasoline for red hot inflation. The economists warned the spending tax hikes will serve as a one-two punch to the economy, boosting demand while handicapping supply.Furthermore, they asserted the suggested minimum corporate tax rate would suffocate a supply chain on life support, while medical price controls will stifle innovation. In a subsequent interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the bill a “complete fraud” because it will fail to attack inflation, while serving as shrapnel to taxpayers and businesses.“That the subsidies to Obamacare include people $304,000 a year,” Graham noted. “That doesn’t sound like helping the poor and it also says the 15 percent minimum in tax that you described will create distance to build factories, buy equipment during a recession. Now who in the right mind wants to tax and spend during a recession?”Democrats, however, shot back at the bill’s skeptics by producing a letter signed by 126 economists in support of the spending binge. The bill’s ambitions were once thought to be extinguished until Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) came to an agreement on the measure with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) With Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) vocalizing her support for the legislation, it’s almost certain to pass through reconciliation.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:30 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022The world’s supply chains are continuing to fall short of the needs for countries that rely on foreign aid. In an interview with Associated Press on Thursday, an administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Samantha Power, gave her point of view as she deals with the global food crisis that has millions going hungry.“”Now we’re almost 20 million people who are going hungry and who are dependent on this emergency food assistance, but other donors are stretched pretty thin, other countries are stretched thin,” she stated.During a visit to the horn of Africa, Power saw just how affected these dependent countries have become. In Kenya, residents have had four consecutive years of drought, where there has not been enough rain to grow food crops and they are projected to have a fifth.“That’s never happened in recorded history to have four consecutive failed rainy seasons and so the livestock, often in famine conditions, that is who dies first,” explained Powers. “And then that ends up being something of a canary in the coal mine for humanity.”Today, I’m announcing a $106M partnership between @USAID and @WFP to provide food and nutrition assistance to nearly 914K crisis-affected people facing food insecurity and malnutrition, across South Sudan. https://t.co/URrecTx8tw— Samantha Power (@PowerUSAID) August 4, 2022Powers claims the shortage is the result of local conflicts and economic disruptions of the pandemic, all of which have been compounded by Russia invading Ukraine. This has deepened food shortages and raised prices as one top global grain producer made war on another.“All of the damage done up to this point by Russia has created such acute needs in Ukraine that the fixed sort of foreign assistance budgets or emergency assistance budgets just now have more claimants,” said Powers.USAID is continuing to monitor the global food crisis and will provide aid to countries that fall short in their own food production.","USAID Administrator Samantha Power is interviewed by the Associated Press, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, at USAID Headquarters in Washington.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) joined the Republicans effort to remove President Joe Biden’s federal environmental regulations.In a 51-to-47-vote, the Senate passed the Congressional Review Act with the intention of overturning a White House rule that was imposed in April. The rule required federal agencies to weigh climate and environmental impacts before issuing permits. The legislation was intended to speed up the processing of major projects.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R- W.Va.) asserted that the removal of the red tape would serve to revitalize an ailing US economy.“As we seek to improve our transportation… we claim our energy independence and build our domestic supply chains,” stated Sen. Capito. “Instead of making the environmental review process more efficient, the Biden administration has been doing everything in its power to make it much, much more difficult.”Fantastic to see @SenDanSullivan’s resolution to overturn @potus’ NEPA rule pass the Senate. However, near unanimous opposition from Senate Democrats makes it incredibly hard to believe strong permitting reform will be taken seriously next month.— Shelley Moore Capito (@SenCapito) August 4, 2022The bill will now head to the House where it will likely face harsh resistance from the Democrat majority.
