10:17 AM PT",New cancer drug could be available within a year,"Cancer researchers have seen substantial progress in their quest to eradicate the disease. A recent clinical trial consisting of 14 rectal cancer patients found they were in complete remission with zero side effects after taking Dostarlimab.In fact, these positive results all occurred without the use of chemotherapy. While the trial was done on rectal cancer patients, researchers believe it could be a potential treatment for many forms of cancer.“When we give immunotherapy, it really just revs up the immune system so that it sees the cancer and gets rid of it, but what’s so remarkable here is that it completely eliminated the cancer,” explained Dr. Andrea Cercek, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “The tumors just vanished in all 14 consecutive patients. Normally when this was used in rectal cancer in patients with advanced disease, that happens in about 10 percent of patients and here it’s 100 percent.”Researchers described the results as unprecedented and have said they will have to repeat the trial in a larger capacity before they label the drug as a potential cure.","In this photo a health care is pictured in Orange, Calif.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:55 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022Voters in San Francisco, California choose to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin. The embattled public official lost his seat in Tuesday’s elections with more than 60 percent of voters calling for his removal.Critics cited his soft-on-crime policies as a contributing factor to the area’s surge in crime rates. They also cited an up-tick in shoplifting, burglaries and open-air drug dealing as reasons to recall him. Despite this, Boudin blamed his loss on being outspent three-to-one.“Voters were not asked to choose between criminal justice reform and something else,” he stated. “They were given an opportunity to voice their frustration and their outrage, and they took that opportunity.”Boudin is the first San Francisco district attorney to be recalled in the city’s history. Meanwhile, the recall effort for fellow progressive District Attorney George Gascon of Los Angeles could be on November’s ballot if the petition garners enough signatures.🚨Chesa Boudin has already done enough damage—now, Biden must not hire him to work at DOJ. We don't need more soft-on-crime radicals in this Administration. Biden should put this issue to rest and confirm that Chesa will not be joining his Administration.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) June 8, 2022There has been speculation that Boudin may be picked up by President Joe Biden as an added member of his administration.

(Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:07 PM PT – Tuesday, June 7, 2022Kyle Rittenhouse is prepared to take legal action against the media for defamation. Rittenhouse spoke to Fox News on Monday, along with his attorney. He declared that he is going to “make the media pay” for it’s coverage of him.“We’re going to look at everything that’s been said,” stated lawyer, Todd McMurtry. “Then determine which of those comments are legally actionable and proceed from there.” The teen was charged in the fatal shooting of two men during the 2020 Kenosha riots. He testified that he acted in self-defense and was ultimately acquitted of all charges. Several news outlets have referred to Rittenhouse as a white supremacist and mass murderer.“Let’s just use for an example what Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg said about Rittenhouse,” McMurtry voiced. “They said that he was involved in a mass murder incident. This was not a mass murder incident. It was clearly factually false. To call somebody a mass murderer is seriously defamatory. Then to use the power of social media to basically censor any views that would take opposition to that mass murderer statement is a serious effort to destroy his character.”His attorney acknowledged the teen was charged with a crime and the media is allowed to report that, but giving him labels without evidence is clearly defamatory. He believes Rittenhouse has “10 to 15 solid” cases against “large defendants.”","KENOSHA, WISCONSIN – NOVEMBER 12: Kyle Rtttenhouse looks back as attorneys argue about the charges that will be presented to the jury during proceedings at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022The House Rules Committee debated on two pieces of gun control laws. In a Tuesday hearing, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) presented the Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Acts.The Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act is an omnibus package which raises the purchasing age for semiautomatic rifles, prohibits the possession of high capacity magazines, establishes requirements regulating the storage of firearms in residences and creates a registry for bump stock owners. Additionally, this measure would allow a family member or law enforcement official to petition a federal court to prohibit an individual they believe to be a risk to themselves from purchasing a firearm or ammunition.“The measures before us offer sensible solutions that a clear, convincing, in fact overwhelming majority of voters agree with,” McGovern stated. “As a country, our leaders, including all of us here in this room, are responsible for making choices. If we do nothing, we are making a choice. We are choosing to be powerless. We are choosing to do nothing to stop the next mass shooting from happening on our watch.”McGovern also claimed that a majority of gun owners supported these two bills in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde.“Most gun owners, I think, favor the stuff that we’re talking about here today,” he noted. “But the extremists in the gun lobby, you know what? They’ll have the last word and more children will die. And I hope maybe this is the moment that there are enough people in a bipartisan way here that will come together and actually do something.”In response to his arguments, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) argued they violated the Second Amendment and Congress should be looking into approaching the issue of mass shootings from a public health perspective.“Our nation is in the midst of a widespread mental health crisis,” Cole explained. “The growing number and frequency of mass shootings are a reminder that our country must take a comprehensive public health approach to gun violence that addresses culture, mental illness, gun safety and regulations that also respect the Second Amendment. But unfortunately, the measures before us today do not meet that test.”Gun control laws only disarm law-abiding citizens because criminals don’t follow the law.— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) June 8, 2022Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) pointed out a major flaw in the Democrats push to implement gun reform legislation.“The gun bills that are presented here today all suffer a common flaw that almost all gun control suffers from, and that is criminals don’t obey the law,” he stated. “Good guys obey the law. They’ll disarm in a gun free zone and then that’s, those are the types of places that the criminals seek out. The chairman said that these bills are not an attempt to take away people’s guns, but in reality these bills will take all guns from some people and some guns from all people. And predominantly it will limit law abiding citizens access to guns.”In the meantime, both bills are expected to hit the House floor this week.","House Rules Committee Ranking Member Tom Cole, R-Okla., left, and Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., confer as the panel prepares to advance a Democratic gun control bill to the floor, the Protecting Our Kids Act, in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and New York, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.

However, some are still criticizing him for past grievances. This comes as both sides of the aisle are in agreement when it comes to helping veterans.Biden signed the legislation into law Tuesday to honor and improve care for veterans. some of the bills seek to provide better access to mammograms for veterans exposed to burn pits, improve breast imaging services. . and to compensate veterans who have developed cancer or medical conditions from World War II-era nuclear programs. Additionally, the President said they are focused on veterans future.“We’re going to strengthen the oversight of the VA’s activities so veterans get the care they deserve,” Biden stated. “And restoring educational systems benefits so veterans displaced by COVID-19 can continue to gain new skills to meet the demands and change in the workforce.”However, Army combat veteran and Florida congressional candidate Cory Mills slammed the administration on Tuesday for failing to show respect for veterans in the past.“This is the same guy who wouldn’t even recognize the 13 fallen who died in Afghanistan and perished during his State of the Union address,” said Mills. “He has missed multiple engagements to actually try and show sympathy or show honor, show respect for our fallen heroes and he’s failed to do so.”Biden was also criticized for acknowledging D-Day late.“We had 150,000 brave Americans who actually landed on the shores to try and take back and fight against the axis of evil,” said Mills. “That 150,000 was considered to be an invasion? We have just in the last couple of months, over 150,000 who have crossed our borders, but the Biden administration still refuses to call that an invasion. The Biden administration is failing us in every single way and what a gaffe to not actually recognize the greatest generation of our lifetimes.”78 years ago we sent 150,000 of our bravest on D-Day for the launch of the “invasion” to defeat evil. Today the Dems do not think the 2,000,000 that has crossed this year, the 150,000 in coming months, and the 11.3M already residing inside the US illegally is an invasion.— Cory Mills 🍊 (@CoryMillsFL) June 6, 2022","President Joe Biden arrives to speak and sign into law nine bipartisan bills that will honor and improve care for America’s veterans during an event in the State Dining room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.
