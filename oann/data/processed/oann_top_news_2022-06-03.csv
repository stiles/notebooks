7:36 AM PT",Nikki Haley accuses UN Human Rights Chief of ‘looking the other way’ on Uighur genocide,"Former United Nations envoy Nikki Haley said UN Human Rights Chief, Michelle Bachelet should be fired for seemingly legitimizing China’s genocide of Uyghur Muslims. On Wednesday, Haley asserted that Bachelet made a “Chinese propaganda tour” to the province of Xinjiang, where the acts are taking place.Haley stressed, Bachelet’s talks with Chinese officials was an inappropriate normalization of China’s actions. This coms as the UN has faced criticism for not doing enough to punish China for holding up to 1 million Uyghurs in forced labor camps. Despite this, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly denied the harsh treatment of Uyghurs, specifically during Bachelet’s visit“Xinjiang is not at all a human rights issue, but a major issue concerning upholding national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” Haley stated. “Clouds cannot overshadow the sun and truth will debunk all lies. China has made clear its stern position on the so-called Xinjiang report, and resolutely opposes smearing and attacking China with lies and disinformation.”Michelle Bachelet, the head of the UN Human Rights Council, should be fired for looking the other way on genocide during her Chinese propaganda tour. https://t.co/ku4SKP8Lmm— Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) June 1, 2022Haley also said Bachelet was looking the other way on the suffering of Uyghurs while suggesting she doesn’t care about human rights. According to the National Review,  she also linked the trip to the Biden administration’s decision to rejoin the UN Human Rights Council. Haley expressed to reporters that she feels it’s shameful that President Joe Biden “justifies American participation in the farce known as the UN Human Rights Council.”","In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, A screen showing Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, holds a virtual meeting with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, Wednesday, May 25, 2022.

(CDC via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:21 AM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022The CDC is investigating a suspected case of monkeypox in Georgia along with two new cases in New York City. On Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Health said it’s looking into the Peach State’s first possible case of monkeypox in a man with a history of international travel.In addition to that case, the New York Health Department reported two more people tested positive for the virus. New York City confirmed it’s first case of monkeypox last month. According to officials, the patient was quarantined as they conducted an investigation.Earlier this week, the CDC had reported 10 cases of monkeypox across the US. The World Health Organization warned the ongoing spread of monkeypox could go undetected for weeks as it reported more than 550 cases worldwide.Monkeypox causes flu-like symptoms before the characteristic rash develops. The virus is spread through close contact with people, animals or material infected with the virus. It enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, the eyes, nose and mouth“We’ve seen a few cases in Europe over the last five years, just in travelers,” said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, who runs the WHO’s smallpox research. “This is the first time we’re seeing cases across many countries at the same time in people who have not traveled to the endemic regions in Africa.” WHO is working with affected countries to stop transmission of #monkeypox (MPX), to provide accurate information to groups most at risk and to protect frontline health workers https://t.co/CBDuiLtHo4 pic.twitter.com/xayhFhxMZx— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) June 2, 2022The outbreak quickly advanced across Europe and North America. It’s expected to be far more widespread as more doctors look for the signs and symptoms. The CDC has put medical professionals on alert and is warning those with higher risk factors, particularly men who have sex with other men, to be vigilant.“Many diseases can be spread through sexual contact,” said WHO advisor Andy Seale. “You could get a cough or a cold through sexual contact. It doesn’t mean that it’s a sexually transmitted disease.” Seale’s agreed many of the people infected in the current outbreak identify as gay or bisexual, but asserted “this is a virus that could affect anyone.” Monkeypox is taking over the global conversation and has left many questioning the validity of the virus’s actual threat. PCR tests are used to identify the infection.","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.

(AP Photos)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:06 PM PT – Wednesday, June 1, 2022President Joe Biden is walking back claims that he wants to see Vladimir Putin removed from office, despite previously stating the Russian leader “could not remain in power.” In a New York Times editorial Tuesday, Biden said the US does not seek a war between NATO and Russia. Additionally, he said the US will not push for Putin’s ouster.The President said as long as the US or our allies are not attacked, America will not directly engage in the war. Biden also asserted US troops will not be sent to Ukraine or attack Russian forces. However, despite his claim, Biden affirmed the US will keep continue military, humanitarian and financial support for the Ukraine government.The US Constitution confers the authority to declare war to the American people thru our congressional reps.

On Wednesday, Russian media reported nuclear drills were held in an area northeast of Moscow.Also in Tuesday’s op-ed, Biden said he would be sending more military equipment as part of a new $700 million package for the Ukraine government, including anti-tank missiles and precision rockets. The Kremlin warned Biden is “adding fuel to the fire,” despite the US President stating that Ukraine will not be able to used those rocket systems to strike into Russia.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated those sentiments Wednesday. He also said there is a strong trust between Ukraine and the US, along with NATO allies and partners.“The Ukrainians have given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory,” Blinken stated. “There is a strong trust bond between Ukraine and the United States as well as with our allies and partners. I’d also say that throughout this aggression, indeed even before, President Biden was very clear with President Putin about what the United States would do if Russia proceeded with its aggression, including continuing to provide security assistance that Ukraine needs to defend itself against the Russian aggression.” In the meantime, energy market analysts believe oil prices could hit $150 per barrel in coming weeks as a result of tensions with Russia. According to reports Tuesday, Russia may reduce oil exports by 18 percent this year. This comes as Russian companies prefer to sell oil in the domestic market and export excess supply to Asia amid Western sanctions. Experts have suggested geopolitical tensions may contribute to an economic downturn in the US.",US President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a ne-hour phone conversation Saturday.

Adm. Karl L. Schultz is being relieved by Adm. Linda Fagan as the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:23 AM PT – Wednesday, June 1, 2022President Joe Biden is reportedly upset with his administration’s handling of the highest inflation in decades. According to a Washington Post report published on Wednesday, over the past several months Biden has privately sounded off about how White House aides are not sufficiently addressing inflation.Biden was said to have told aides they are not doing enough to explain what is causing inflation and what they are doing to reduce it. The President’s reported frustration comes as recent polls indicate most Americans do not approve of his handling of inflation or the economy as a whole.Despite this, Biden administration economists have said the looming economic recession is nothing to worry about. Administration officials appear to be keeping their heads in the ground as the US economy is on its way to catastrophe. At the White House and on corporate networks Tuesday, several of President Biden’s economic advisors tried to downplay the severity of rampant inflation and chocked supply chain.Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese echoed the long defunct talking point that the economy is in a “transitory period.” Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell blasted officials for using that term last year. At that time, he said it was too late in the game to call the crisis transitory. That didn’t stop Deese from downplaying the economic woes experienced at the hands of the Biden administration while also claiming the US economy is in a good place.“The economy we have right now is in a transition from this period of historical economic growth to a period that can be more stable, resilient growth,” he stated. “That required focusing on inflation and doing so from a position of relative strength. The US is in a better position to do so in part because of the strength of our labor market recovery, the strength of household balance sheets.”National Economic Council director Brian Deese speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)However, the numbers show the economy is not in a good place. Economists have lamented the inflation rate is at a more than 40-year high. Additionally, gas prices have soared since Biden occupied the Oval Office with national averages exceeding $4.00 and in California more than $6.00. It appears that those prices keep hitting record highs week after week. Other experts have pointed to the problems with the supply chain that is causing store shelves to run dry and is keeping baby formula from nurturing children.Recently, Powell warned Americans are going to feel some more pain while the central bank posits to fight inflation. However, the Biden administration appears to be incapable of admitting its mistakes. Instead, Biden officials have continued to blame COVID-19 and Russia’s Vladimir Putin for America’s crumbling economy.“What we understood about inflation at the time was that it was tied to the pandemic, said chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Cecilia Rouse, PH.D. “We are still in the midst of this pandemic. Russia’s war on Ukraine disabled not only gas prices and food prices, but also disrupted supply chains. We didn’t foresee Delta, we didn’t forsee Omicron. And So, yes, there have been unexpected challenges, which have disrupted getting us back to the natural equilibrium that would help bring down those prices.”There is one Biden administration official who is taking responsibility for her miscalculations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that she was wrong to say inflation would not snowball in several interviews last year. She admitted there were several Biden administration programs, including massive spending bills, energy cutting policiesand insufficient supply chain, that contributed to the economic crisis.However, Yellen and President Biden have said the administration is not ready to correct course and is deferring responsibility to the Federal Reserve. The Treasury secretary said the fed will have to lead the way on combatting inflation and the rest of the Biden administration will follow suit.“And for our part, President Biden is focused on supplementing what the Fed does with actions we can take to lower the costs that American face for important expenditures they have in their budgets,” Yellen stated.In the meantime, Powell has vowed to wage war on inflation until the Consumer Price Index returns the Fed’s target at 2 percent. Some economists and lawmakers warned a recession could come in the coming months if the Biden administration fails to take hold of inflation.","President Joe Biden participates in a change of command ceremony at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, Wednesday, June 1, 2022, in Washington.

Jacob Albarado recalled his experience of rushing to the Uvalde school to save his wife and daughter.During an exclusive interview with NBC on Tuesday, Albarado said his day began with an award ceremony for his daughter, breakfast with his mom, and a car wash. Things took a turn when he sat down for a haircut at a barber shop, which wasn’t too far from his daughter’s elementary school.“My barber actually heard shots,” he said. Albarado’s wife, who is a fourth grade teacher, and his daughter, a second grader, were inside the Uvalde Elementary School as the tragic shooting unfolded. The off-duty Border Patrol agent said he did what he was trained to do and jumped into action. He said when he arrived at the school, he was armed with his barber’s shotgun. Police let him inside.“I looked for a gun,” the agent stated. “My barber said he had a gun. Both of us raced over to the school and met up there.”The agent described seeing absolute chaos with some police already there and parents trying to get into the school. According to the New York Times, his daughter was locked inside a bathroom while his wife hid under desks with her students. He eventually learned they were both safe and helped evacuate children as they climbed through windows for safety.“I was just trying to get towards my wife’s room and my daughter’s room,” Albarado voiced. “As I was going in, I could just see kids coming out the windows, kids coming my way. So I was helping all the kids out.”He later learned that one of his daughter’s friends and teammates were shot and killed. In a social media post after the tragedy the CBP agent called for changes to be made at all schools in the US. He also called for teachers to be trained and allowed to carry in order to protect themselves and students.","FILE – Flowers and candles are placed around crosses at a memorial outside Robb Elementary School to honor the victims killed in this week’s school shooting in Uvalde, Texas Saturday, May 28, 2022.

(Patrick Doyle/The Canadian Press via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:20 AM PT – Wednesday, June 1, 2022A gun shop owner in British Columbia said Canada’s hand gun ownership freeze punishes law-abiding citizens, while the government rewards criminals. Matt Mendel, the co-owner of Wanstall’s Hunting & Shooting, strongly disagrees with the sweeping declaration by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The legislation freezes the buying, selling and transfers of handguns between consenting parties until further notice. Mendel thinks the order is unlikely to decrease violence in Canada as most weapons used at crime scenes are obtained illegally. He lamented the measure will greatly reduce his sales volume, in turn, diminishing the recreational shooting industry from year-round to seasonal.“This does not do anything to address the illegal firearms that are being picked up after the scene of the crime where 82 percent of them are smuggled in coming from the United States,” explained the gun shop owner. “I think it’s a waste of resources that could be better allocated towards anti-trafficking, for example.”While addressing the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday, Conservative Party Leader Candice Bergen found it hypocritical for Trudeau’s government to punish law-abiding citizens, while simultaneously loosening repercussions for criminals.“On one hand, they’re banning handguns,” he noted. “On the other hand, they’re pushing through Bill C-5, which tells criminals, don’t worry if you’re convicted of a gun crime, you just hang out at home for your sentence. This is not keeping community safe, and it is not reassuring to moms and dads who are worried about their kids.”Bill C-5, which was proposed late last year, removes minimal sentencing for a number of gun-related crimes, excluding the usage of a firearm in connection to a criminal organization. Trudeau, however, doubled down on his progressive policy, while claiming it will fix the inequitable composition of Canada’s penal system.“The Bill C-5 legislation does not stop police from charging people with gun offences or prosecutors from pursuing convictions,” claimed the prime minister. “What it does do is make sure criminals face serious penalties, while addressing the overrepresentation of black Canadians and indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system.”The legislation, pushed forward by Trudeau on Monda,y will also limit magazines to a five-round capacity and even ban toys resembling guns. Additionally, Canada’s public safety minister also announced a mandatory buyback program for so-called assault weapons later this year.Despite years of more gun control, bans, buybacks, and nearly a billion dollars spent, gun violence continues to go up in Canada. Today Trudeau doubled down on his failed approach and again promised Canadians it will keep them safe. It won’t, just as it hasn’t for years. #cdnpoli— Raquel Dancho (@RaquelDancho) May 30, 2022Conservative MP, Raquel Dancho blasted the move on Twitter, while claiming Canada’s crime rate has been rising despite years of gun bans and buy-backs. However,  Trudeau has made it clear he won’t allow discussions on effectiveness slow down gun control agenda.“We cannot let the guns debate become so polarized that nothing gets done,” stated the prime minister. “We cannot let that happen in our country.”","Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces new gun control legislation in Ottawa, Ontario, on Monday, May 30, 2022.

Investor Stephen Schork said rising prices on natural gas are driving fuel and heating prices, while also contributing to rising food prices. He believes “the war on natural gas is a war on the American consumer.”“So the inflation has not peaked…and this is the problem, runaway inflation at the gas pump and the grocery counter has been the lead indicator for recession of the last six recessions in the United States,” Schork explained.As a result, US consumers are facing shrinking incomes and worse quality of life.

The three officials spoke at the White House about the bids by Sweden and Finland to join NATO amid opposition by Turkey.“The decisions by Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership are historic,” said Stoltenberg. “They will strengthen our Alliance. We have to address the security concerns of all allies and I’m confident that we will find the united way forward.”Great meeting with @POTUS to prepare for our #NATOSummit later this month. I thanked him for the #US leadership in #NATO's response to #Russia's war in #Ukraine.

He believes those countries have no place in NATO. He also acknowledged that NATO is preparing for a long lasting conflict in Ukraine.“Wars are by nature unpredictable and therefore we just have to be prepared for the long haul,” he stated.Stoltenberg declared that while NATO does not want confrontation with Russia, the western military alliance has a “responsibility” to support Ukraine. He plans to meet with leaders from those three countries in the coming days.“The easiest way to get more grain out and to reduce the pressure on food prices is for President Putin to end the war,” the NATO Chief voiced . “As long as that’s not the case, I welcome the effort by different countries.”Stoltenberg said he looks forward to welcoming President Biden to the NATO summit in Madrid in the coming weeks.","NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, left, attends a meeting with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon, Thursday, June 2, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:43 PM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022President Joe Biden addressed the ongoing baby formula shortage as parents nationwide are struggling to feed their infants. While speaking to reporters at the White House Wednesday, he detailed his efforts to help get more formula onto store shelves.“We can’t let up in the infant formula market until its back to normal,” said Biden. “It’s going to take a couple more months, but we’re making significant process.”The shortage came after the Abbot baby formula plant in Michigan was shutdown. The shutdown, which took place in February, was due to two infant deaths linked to unsanitary conditions and practices at the facility.“We launched Operation Fly Formula, a major effort to airlift infant formula that meets Americans health standards and safety standards,” he stated. “Today, I’m proud to say that because of this flight, high quality formula is already on the way to American shelves. We’ve already conducted two flights with 1.5 million eight ounce bottles of Nestlé and Gerber’s hypo allergenic formulas for children with severe allergies.”  Biden also claimed he was not informed of the severe nature of the shortage until early April.“Here’s the deal, I became aware of this problem sometime in early April,” the president voiced. “We did everything in our power from that point on and that’s all I can tell you right now.”Despite his remarks, critics point out that he didn’t address the crisis until May. The president met with baby formula manufacturers for a virtual meeting Wednesday. During the meeting they told him they warned the FDA and his administration of upcoming shortages earlier this year.His push to alleviate the crisis comes as the White House recently announced United Airlines will now ship 3.7 million eight ounce bottles of the Kendamil infant formula from the UK. This will be Operation Fly Formula’s third mission.I’ve got an update on our efforts to bring more infant formula to the United States: We secured another 6.5 million bottles of safe infant formula from Nestlé. That means as of today, 94.5 million bottles of safe infant formula are heading to U.S. shelves. pic.twitter.com/1s4A5CphpB— President Biden (@POTUS) June 2, 2022The process will take three weeks to complete.","President Joe Biden listens as he meets virtually with infant formula manufacturers from the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:15 AM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022The White House is, once again, justifying President Joe Biden’s statements after reports of US cyber attacks against Russia have emerged. According to administration officials, this offensive against Russia does not violate Biden’s policy of not directly engaging with the country.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre fielded questions Wednesday about recent reports that the US was engaged in hacking operations aimed at Russia.Reporter: Just speaking specifically about the offensive cyber action being taken from the United States against Russia. Is that not contrary to what the President has said in the past about not wanting to engage directly?)Jean-Pierre: No, it’s not. We don’t see it as such.Reporter: Can you talk about why offensive cyber activity against Russia is not?Jean-Pierre: I mean, it’s just, we just don’t see it as such. We have talked about this before. We’ve had our cyber experts here at the podium layout what our plan is. That has not changed. So, the answer is just simply, no.’The White House’s response came after the head of US Cyber Command, General Paul Nakasone, confirmed to Sky News that the US conducted a series of offensive hacking operations in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The four-star general did not offer details, but said they were offensive, defensive and information operations.In a New York Times editorial Tuesday, Biden walked-back claims that he wanted to see Russian President Vladimir Putin removed from office despite previously saying he “could not remain in power.” Biden said the US does not seek a war between NATO and Russia. He also noted the US will not push for Putin’s ouster.The President said as long as the US or it’s allies are not attacked, America will not directly engage in the war. Despite his claim, however, Biden affirmed the US will continue military, humanitarian and financial support for the Ukraine government. Nonetheless, the President failed to mention anything about cyber attacks.","White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:13 AM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022Mourners gathered in Uvalde, Texas to pay their respects to the victims of the Robb Elementary School shooting. On Wednesday, Uvalde said goodbye to high school sweethearts Irma and Jose Garcia.Irma Garcia was one of the two teachers killed in the horrific shooting. Her husband Jose Garcia died of a heart attack just two days after the incident, following a visit to her memorial. Garcia died while using her body to shield students after the shooter entered the school last week, killing her co-teacher and 19 children. The two were married for 24 years and left behind four children.“They came to mass every Sunday,” said Father Eduardo D. Morales. “Helping whenever we needed help. She shielded the children and that’s who she would be. They say will you lay your life down for one, she did.” Visitations, funerals and burial services for the 21 victims started this week . The funerals will continue through mid-June. Services for 10-year-olds Amerie Jo Garza and Maite Rodriguez were held on Tuesday. Both died while trying to save their classmates from the shooter.“Ten years isn’t enough for her,” voiced Destiny Esquivel, cousin of Maite Rodriguez. “She had more than that. In the casket she looks like nothing happened to her, she looks like she died at peace. We all know that every single one of these kids had their story to tell and it was cut short.”The Texas Department of Public Safety said Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo has yet to respond to a request for a follow up interview with investigators. Questions as to why it took officers over an hour to breach the classroom remain unanswered. In the meantime, authorities continue their investigations into the shooting.","Balloons honoring the victims killed in last week’s school shooting sway in the wind at a memorial at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Thursday, June 2, 2022.

(AP Photo/File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:00 AM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022The US Supreme Court halted the count of some mail-in ballots casted in Pennsylvania’s primary elections. Justice Samuel Alito gave the order Tuesday, pausing a lower court ruling over a disputed 2021 local court election. That case would have allowed for the counting of mail-in ballots without a handwritten date on them.It’s unclear when the Supreme Court will review the case further or how long it would take, but Pennsylvania’s Senate primary race will likely be affected. The new ruling will no longer allow election officials to count dateless ballots. This means Republican Senate candidate David McCormick likely won’t catch up to his competitor Mehmet Oz as the recount must be finished by June 8.pic.twitter.com/IrfOy2T6jj— Dave McCormick (@DaveMcCormickPA) May 25, 2022As McCormick scrounges for ballots to make up the gap with Oz, Alito’s order could freeze McCormick’s lawsuit in Pennsylvania state courts. A senior campaign official briefed reporters about the plans and offered several complaints.“I can’t tell you today with full confidence, I can’t tell my client how many votes we have,” stated the official. “We’re doing a recount of a count that I actually don’t know the results of. We have essentially two different sources of data. One being the counties, two being the Department of State with completely different results.”The eventual winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) who won the Democratic nomination in November.","FILE – Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidates David McCormick, left, and Mehmet Oz during campaign appearances in May 2022 in Pennsylvania.
