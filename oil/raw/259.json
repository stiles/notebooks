To standardize the nesting survey effort, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) began the Florida Index Nesting Beach Surveys (INBS).  The program developed specific standardized protocols to guide nesting beach survey efforts on selected beaches.  Egmont Key was proposed to the Trustee Council because the west coast of Florida is underrepresented in the INBS program and Egmont Key represented a relatively active nesting beach with few human-related nesting beach disturbances. The Trustee Council provided funds to the project sponsor to cover the first 5 years of a required ten-year commitment to data collection.",

A fish ladder was constructed to provide passage to 40 acres of freshwater spawning habitat.  Monitoring was conducted at the site to determine presence/absence of target species. Between 2009-2014 NOAA\u0027s cooperative agreement with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) provided for a contract with Seatuck Environmental, a local non-profit group, to monitor and maintain the ladder in good working order. During the monitoring period river herring were found to be utilizing the fish ladder to migrate upstream.

    "projectDescription": "The primary goal of this project was to restore hydrology to approximately 175 acres of DE state- owned land north of Pickering Beach Road. Currently this area is void of daily tidal exchange. Historical inlets to the Delaware Bay no longer exist on the eastern portion of the marsh, while the remainder of the marsh is bound by existing roads and impoundment dike at the north, west, and southern boundaries of the marsh.  The project involved the restoration of a previously existing north to south ditch of approximately 1.3 miles running from the Little Creek Main Impoundment at the north to the existing Lewis Ditch at the south.\n\nA second component of this project involved the replacement of a non-functioning water control structure located along the southern dike of the Little Creek Main Impoundment adjacent to the Pickering Marsh.  Due to limited flow through the Pickering Marsh, this secondary water control structure on the impoundment has not been placed in use and is currently in need of replacement. A functioning structure at this location would allow for tidal flow through the impoundment during portions of the year serving as a benefit to fisheries in addition to improving the health of the impounded wetland habitat to the benefit of an abundance of wildlife utilizing the area.\n",

Berman, grounded on a reef off Punta Escambron, releasing approximately 800,000 gallons of fuel oil into coastal waters near San Juan, Puerto Rico. About one week later, a secondary release of nearly 125,000 gallons of an oil/water mixture occurred during and after removal operations and vessel scuttling. The oil spread along the northern coast of Puerto Rico, injuring natural and historic resources along the shoreline.  More than 100 miles of ocean and 66 miles of bay shorelines were oiled.  The Condado Coral Trail Project helped restore lost reef services resulting from this grounding and spill by placing 45 coral reef modules in a snorkeling trail formation within the Condado Lagoon.  In addition, the San Juan Bay Estuary Partnership implemented an education and outreach campaign describing the significance of the project and installed project signage along the public beach that overlooks the project site.",

To bring back the kelp forests, volunteer divers, commercial urchin divers, researchers, and local non-profit groups will assist SMBRF with removing urchins from the “urchin barrens” and allow for natural settlement of kelp plants. Permits for collection of urchins and to conduct research were obtained in July 2013 and urchin removal began shortly after obtaining permits. Monitoring of the urchin barrens will also take place to measure the increase in kelp forest habitat. ",

A settlement was reached for $12.5 million in 1991. Funds from combined cases (BT Nautilus and Cibro Savanah) have been used to restore injured wetlands in NY and NJ. \n\nThe LP West Wetland Project constructed a 42 acre restoration site at a former municipal 90-acre landfill (Jersey City). The Exxon Bayway fund provided $250,000 to planning and design - completed in Sept 2009. The total project construction cost was $13.6 million provided by the ARRA of 2009 ($10.6 million), Exxon Bayway fund ($2.2 million) and NJDEP NRDA fund ($800,000). Construction began in 2010 and was concluded following a two-year monitoring effort in May of 2012. \n\nThe project excavated 42 acres of polluted sediment and landfill to below the clean sub-surface and placed the fill under the adjacent 50 acre capped landfill as required by a NJDEP landfill closure order. The ACOE Nav Deepening Program supplied 500,000 cubic yds of clean sand by barge and pumped to an upland de-watering facility. 250,000 cu yds of sand was placed over the 42 acre excavation site and was contoured to create 24 ac wetland and tide creeks, 9 ac tidal pond, 8 acre grassland and 1 ac trail system.

The grounding resulted in the opening of four if its 17 cargo tanks, releasing approximately 306,000 gallons of oil.  The DNREC 1989 pre-assessment Screen Report on the spill reports that 22 miles of riverine and estuarine shoreline was impacted by the oil. The No. 6 fuel oil was a highly viscous oil, and formed a thick coating upon contact with the shoreline.  Vegetation along 22 miles of Delaware River and Bay shoreline were impacted in widths of 5-20 feet. \n\nThis 182-acre wetland property was purchased in 1998 and added to the already existing NJ State Mad Horse Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA).  An abandoned building that blighted this stretch of property near its upland reached was demolished early in 2001.  A 200 acre habitat restoration of tidal marsh, grassland meadows and wet meadows at the WMA has completed its planning and design phase and moved into permitting in 2012. The project is being funding by the Presidente Rivera and MV Athos spills in Delaware Bay and Delaware River.  A Phase 1-A and Phase 2 Archaeological Study was completed in 2016.

    "projectDescription": "On Saturday, June 24, 1989, the Presidente Rivera, a 749 foot Uruguayan tanker, ran aground in the Delaware River on Claymont Shoal, near Naamans Creek. The ship was carrying 18 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil and was preparing to dock at the Sun Oil Company refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. The grounding resulted in the opening of four if its 17 cargo tanks, releasing approximately 306,000 gallons of oil. The tanker was re-floated on Sunday, June 25, 1989, and was taken to the Sun Oil Company refinery where the remainder of its cargo was unloaded. The DNREC 1989 Pre-assessment Screen Report on the spill reported that 22 miles of riverine and estuarine shoreline was impacted by the oil. The most heavily oiled areas in the Delaware River were immediately south of the Port of Wilmington for a distance of approximately three miles. The No. 6 fuel oil spilled by the Presidente Rivera was a highly viscous oil, and formed a thick coating upon contact with the shoreline.  Vegetation along 22 miles of Delaware River and Bay shoreline were impacted in widths of 5-20 feet. Booms were strategically placed to help reduce impacts to sensitive riverbank areas and Pea Patch Island (home to the largest heron rookery on the east coast). This project included erosion stabilization along Pea Patch Island and 57 acre herbicide treatment of Phragmites removal along the southeastern portion of the island.  Over 95% of Phragmites was eliminated with no evidence of recurring invasions.\n",

The restoration plan called for a first phase removal of debris and trapped sediments, and a re-contouring of the interior to include such features as open water, tidal creeks and vegetated salt marsh. Upon completion of the interior, the second phase called for the removal of the dike wall to allow tidal flow into the interior. A floating debris barrier was planned for the outer rim of the project site but was later not required. DARRP funds from the Exxon Bayway oil spill settlement covered some of the design and feasibility study costs, while additional funds came from the Arthur Kill Deepening Program Mitigation Fund (ACOE).

The possible interactions between wildlife populations and their habitat were assessed in order to determine the cause of colony collapse and identify solutions.  NRCS made assessments of soil structure and chemistry. Predator presence were performed by NRG. All 7000 trees on the island were cataloged determine nest platform suitability. New York City Audubon investigated heron utilization of the island. With this data it was determined that invasion by invasive tree species was having deleterious effect on the already complex species interactions. Data gathering supported the receipt of additional funding through the New York State CWCA Bond Act for design and construction of tree canopy enhancement on the island. A plan for invasive tree removal and replanting with suitable trees for nesting was halted by the USDA APHIS when the Asian long-horn beetle became present on the island and required an entirely different approach to eradication. APHIS removed the native trees from the island due to a demonstrated preference by the beetle for North American deciduous trees. The heron colony, though already small due to predator pressures, was lost. ",

The American Cyanamid Superfund Trustees Restoration Plan determined that the dam was a suitable preferred alternative and partial compensation for ecological injuries stemming from in-river contaminant releases at the former American Cyanamid facility in nearby Bridgewater NJ. Some form of dam had existed at the site since the 1700\u0027s thus blocking migratory fish passage for over 250 years. The most current version of the dam was a reinforced concrete spillway structure built in the mid 1930\u0027s.  The mill was destroyed in the early 1970\u0027s and ceased operation. The remnant mill structures are considered eligible for historic listing while the dam itself was not. Under the terms of the Natural Resources Damages Consent Decree with Wyeth Holdings (the current owner of the America Cyanamid Superfund site in Bridgewater NJ), the 3.0 foot high spillway structure was removed to allow migration of migratory fish species to the next barrier, 4.6 miles upstream on the Millstone River at Blackwell Mills.

    "projectDescription": "This project is restoring beach, dune, and marsh habitats. In May 2016, we began creating the barrier island. Beach and dunes were recreated between Pass Ronquille and Pass Chaland in southernmost Plaquemines Parish, using sand dredged from the Gulf of Mexico. A hydraulic dredge was used to scoop up sediment from the shoreline, mixing it with water, and pumping the mixture through a pipeline to the island. The mixture was then shaped into dune and marsh habitat by powerful earth moving equipment.\n\nThe Engineering and Design portion of this project was implemented and supported by the CWPPRA Task Force. Construction of the new marsh began in September 2016 and was completed in January 2017. Beach and dune construction began in October 2016, and the project was completed  by the end of February 2017.\n\nThe project was part of the third phase of early restoration after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This project restored a portion of the barrier chain that separates Barataria Basin from the Gulf of Mexico. It will help protect the coastal ecosystems and communities in the Basin from storms. It will also reduce erosion from shorelines in Barataria Bay, which were heavily impacted by the spill. ",

Because synthesized research on the long-term effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill found that chronic persistence of oil has sub-lethal impacts on marine populations, the Copper River Watershed Project was concerned about the effects of stormwater runoff (including melting snow) on sockeye and coho populations in Eyak Lake, coho salmon in Odiak Pond, and juvenile herring in eastern Prince William Sound.  Due to unusually low amounts of snowfall during the winters of this grant period, we were unable to sample snow meltwater runoff.  We did complete a municipal and state snow handling practices analysis, improve one snow storage site and complete design of a second, and produce a snow storage guidance document for use by municipalities and state agencies.This design  was later used to complete another project.",

One such response action – the barging in of rock through Keil Cove, Marine County resulted in a grounding scar that caused injury to eelgrass located in the northeast corner of the cove.  At the time NRDA was eager to implement emergency restoration actions.  However, the landowners were not willing to allow restoration to occur.  So an agreement was made to only monitor the site with sidescan and multibeam to determine the degree of injury and monitor recovery.  If the site had not recovered, restoration would take place.  After reviewing multiple years of sidescan/multibeam images, it was concluded that the surrounding eelgrass had moved into the scar and was fully recovered by 2014.",

The Mattiace Petrochemical Natural Resources Damage Trustees Council made a contribution of $42,200 towards the construction of the fish ladder. The Nature Conservancy was awarded Long Island Sound Future Fund money towards fish passage plan development and implementation for three sites in Connecticut and New York. The site in New York is the spillway on Beaver Lake that impedes passage to and from the brackish Mill Creek. The grant provided money to develop plans for a fish ladder and apply for the necessary construction permits. Additional funds were needed to meet the cash requirement for installation of the planned fish ladder. The Mattiace Trustees Council drafted an addendum to the Restoration Plan in order to make $42,200 available for the project in addition to the $298,236 already secured. ",

The 5 acre woodland enhancement was accomplished by removing invasive species in the under-story via a variety of chemical and biological methods, followed by planting of native species.  The understory was dominated by Norway maple, English ivy, vinca, Pachysandra and Japanese spurge.  Removal was initially attempted using two applications of herbicide, with biological and manual labor. Native species such as downy serviceberry, flowering dogwood, white oak, swamp white oak, American holly, sweet pepperbush, joe-pye weed, and broom sedge were planted.  Project funding from NOAA was matched with funds from NFWF and additional matching funds and in-kind services from Restaino Design; a David Workman grant; the Charles Piper Cot Award Internship, the Chingos Foundation, and Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary and Audubon Center.  Approximately $19,812 was to be spent on the purchase of plants and supplies, $38,500 on 2 contractual applications of herbicide, and up to $15,063.27 for staff time for mechanical invasive treatment and planting and maintenance of native species. The Sanctuary employed Green Goats Inc. The goats were partially successful in managing English Ivy. ",

From 1948 to 1980, a chemical manufacturing plant operated on 3 acres of the site. Site operators discharged wastewater from the plant into an unlined lagoon. Wastewater containing chemicals flowed through an adjacent tidal marsh, through the Lobdell Canal, and into the Christina River. These activities contaminated sediment, soil, surface water and groundwater. The NRDA settlement consisted of the 2003 purchase of 248 acre degraded Cleaver Marsh and transfer of title to DNREC; installation of osprey nesting structures; and purchase of herbicide and application costs ($58,500) to DNREC. The Cleaver Marsh is an island on the “Appaquinimink River east of Odessa, Delaware. The March 2003 draft Natural Resources Trustee Position on a Covenant Not To Sue for the Halby Chemical Company Superfund Site, refers to the Cleaver Marsh as 90 percent dominated by Phragmites australis. 223 acres of phragmites was eradicated and restored o a Spartina alterniflora dominated marsh.  The document also stated, “It is fully anticipated with Phragmites control and reintroduction of Spartina alternaflora, that fisheries habitat quality and quantity will increase primarily through the re-development of tidal guts and pools within this marsh.\" The treatment of the marsh with herbicide became a routine (yearly) part of operations and management through the rest of the decade.  \n",

The vessel initially sank on the shallow, nearshore reef and was then pushed shoreward across the reef a distance of approximately 366 meters, by the very rough seas that were occurring at the time of the sinking. As a result of the vessel sinking, extensive physical (fractured and gouged reef structure), and biological (broken and dislodged reef biota including hard and soft corals and sponges) injuries occurred on the reef. The initial triage and salvage of living hard and soft corals was conducted during 29 March-1 May 2007, with subsequent reattachment of the organisms during early June 2007. This work was conducted by a team comprised of local, state and federal diving scientists.\n\nThe second phase of the restoration plan included the management and stabilization of the significant amount of rubble material created as a result of the vessel grounding. The State trustees contracted with Sea Byte Inc. to conduct the rubble related portions of the restoration effort.Work related to rubble stabilization was conducted on the injury site in two phases. The initial phase consisted of a mapping and rubble collection effort and the second phase consisted of rubble stabilization and habitat reconstruction effort. ",

USFWS led this project located on the Mispillion River in Kent County, Delaware, in order to compensate the public for natural resources injuries stemming from hazardous waste releases at the DuPont manufacturing facility in Newport DE.  An eroded, degraded marsh has been transformed into vital habitat for local wildlife. The 56-acre private site consists of one of the river\u0027s original meanders and associated wetland with more than 2,000 feet of river frontage. Large timbers were placed end to end along a half-mile run of the Mispillion River near Milford DE in order to slow or halt the erosion of the tidal marsh. The project was completed in Oct 2008 and monitored through June 2012. The Mispillion marshes had degraded in the 50 years since the navigation channel was realigned and straightened.  The oxbow channel had filled in and the marsh was colonized by Common Reed (Phragmites australis), an invasive plant. The western edge of the marsh was severely eroded due to boat wakes. To slow erosion large timbers were anchored end to end along 2,000 ft of shore and the oxbow was dredged and deepened. The sediment cast into the marsh through a technique known as thin layer spreading. ",

Requested funding was $39,225.  The Underhill Preserve is an open space area located within the Town of Jericho. The preserve is co-owned by the Town of Oyster Bay, State of New York and Nassau County and the project was proposed by the Huntington-Oyster Bay Audubon Society. The grasslands and meadows continue to be threatened by invasive species, such as garlic mustard, Japanese honeysuckle and porcelain berry after completion of the project.  Restoration and protection of the biological diversity of this preserve was designed to protect one of the largest contiguous grasslands in Nassau County. \n",

After reviewing these alternatives, the Trustees agreed that the proposed restoration alternative could best meet their objectives. The following restoration was chosen and implemented\n\n1) Removed two trash racks from culverts in Helmet Creek. Removing these barriers opened up  approximately 5,000 squared meters of new salmon habitat.\n2) Monitoring control structures on the Creek to ensure they maximize fish passage.\n3) Restored grade of creek for fish passage, \n4) Improved low flow passage by capping a side channel culvert above the tank farm,\n5) Removed debris from the creek and floodplain, \n6) Revegetated banks to minimize disturbance and provide bank stability.",

Fishing staff on the boat will also show the kids and counselors how to properly fillet a fish for the safest possible consumption. Copies of the MSRP Comic Book and Fish Identification Card will be distributed to the children to take home and to share with their friends and families.

The completed waterfront park includes features such as an amphitheater, an entry plaza, exercise stations, a fishing plaza, hiking/biking paths and trails, historic/educational signage, a kayak launch, a picnic area, a playground, a sensory garden, shoreline observation areas, and a vista summit with panoramic views of Camden, the Delaware River, and Philadelphia. Habitat restoration involved enhancing and expanding the existing freshwater wetlands by constructing approximately 7 acres of tidal freshwater wetlands on both the Cooper and Delaware Rivers, creating 3 living shoreline areas along the back channel of the Delaware River, preserving three areas of existing trees as bald eagle forage habitat, re-planting trees within the remainder of the bald eagle forage habitat including an area where large, specimen trees were planted. Over 375,000 plantings were included in the project. The tidal freshwater wetland on the Cooper River  connects to a fishing pond that is a prominent feature of the waterfront park.",

Specific genetic structure of Fucus was found within the bay but genetics were not different enough between local sites/populations to require donor individuals to be taken from extremely proximal transplant sites. Rather, it was decided that donor Fucus be taken from Golden Gate Fields and transplanted to Point Isabel for the first stage (trial) of restoration. After monitoring in 2018/2019 there was a decline in the transplants.  It was decided that a new site would have to be established.  In the fall of 2020 new transplants were placed at Giant Marsh/ Richmond, CA.  Monitoring will continue into 2021.  See monitoring section for results.\n",

Dense, non-native Phragmites australis (common reed) patches occur in several places at the Sanctuary; two areas are targeted for control. In both these areas, plants exceed three meters in height, obscure views of the shore and bay, create a monoculture, and threaten to further encroach into wildlife habitats. Along the east side of the sanctuary, common reed forms a fringe along the boundary between the salt marsh and a former corn field that has been restored to a warm-season grassland with a perimeter trail. The tall, invasive plant grows between the edge of the grassland and the salt marsh, and thus disrupts continuity of the plant community structure that is highly beneficial to wildlife. MassAudubon will use both herbicide and mechanical removal. Initial treatment will take place at the end of the growing season with foliar application of a formulation of glyphosate that is approved for use in wetlands. Licensed applicators will spray standing plants in September and early October when plants are actively moving nutrients into the root rhizomes. MassAudubon is also constructing a public trail project including an all-persons access trail.",

The 100-foot-wide channel connects the Potomac River and Pentagon Lagoon between Columbia Island and Arlington, Virginia. The Boundary Channel property has undergone undesirable changes from the establishment of invasive non-native species. The upland habitat consists mainly of a monoculture mat of Ampelopsis and other invasive vines. This project will remove non-native invasive plants from both sides of the entire length of shoreline and adjacent uplands. Cleared areas will then be replanted with native shrubs, grasses, and flowers beneficial to wildlife. The Trustees estimate that 11,000 linear feet of improved shoreline, 4 acres of riparian forested/shrub habitat and 7 acres of upland grassland meadow/shrub habitat will be restored through this project.

The Trustees undertook a hydrological assessment of the Dunstan River Marsh to determine the most ecologically beneficial method for enhancing the site.  The assessment evaluated tidal hydrology both upstream and downstream of US 1, determined the degree of tidal restriction caused by the road, evaluated freshwater input to the system; and provided recommendations for restoring the natural hydrology of the system.  Options that the Trustees evaluated for restoring the marsh include adding an additional culvert under US 1, creating pannes and new tidal channels, and removing fill.

The dam was a large stone, wood and concrete structure, about 10-feet high with a 9-foot spillway, with an existing bypass channel/fishway that needed improvement.  A better fishway was designed for this location to greatly increase the alewife run and reduce the maintenance burden currently required, while also retaining and respecting the heritage of the mill site.  A feasibility study was conducted in 2018 to evaluate alternatives for this site, which consisted of stabilization of the existing dam, enhancement of the existing nature-like fishway to increase the capacity, and modifications to sections of the dam and immediately downstream to protect out-migrating fish, especially juvenile alewives.  The project proceeded through final design, permitting and construction, and included increased capacity of the upstream passage channel, a new exit structure, new downstream passage chutes and plunge pools, water level controls (stoplogs) and a new dry hydrant for firefighting water supply.  After fish passage improvements were completed in 2020, the site was turned into a municipally-owned park with public access and interpretive signage about the site\u0027s history and ecology of the alewife run.\n",

When disturbance events occur, the birds may flee from their nests, leaving their eggs and chicks unprotected from predators and adverse weather conditions. In addition, the eggs or chicks may be accidentally knocked off rocks or cliffs when the birds flee.

    "projectDescription": "Hurricane Mathew passed south of Puerto Rico in October 2016 generating large storm waves that impacted a large stand of the ESA listed elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) off of Guanica on the south coast of Puerto Rico.  The large waves damaged many of the elkhorn coral colonies and generated thousands of coral fragments. Restoration efforts focused on saving the at-risk fragments that were loose and were likely going to die.  The impacted area has a large healthy population of A. palmata, so fragments were transplanted to other reefs to assist in recovery of elkhorn populations in other areas.  Approximately 8,500 corals were transplanted to 10 different reefs.  Coral fragments were also brought into 4 different nurseries in Guanica and La Parguera to assist with coral propagation efforts.   ",

    "projectDescription": "The M/V Aubi, a 49’ powered catamaran, ran aground on a coral reef the evening of 14May2015  within a newly established Puerto Rico Marine Reserve in the vicinity of La Cueva del Indio, Arecibo, Puerto Rico (Figure 1).  There were high densities of corals in this area including thickets of Acropora palmata which is listed as Threatened under ESA.  The 8mm thick, aluminum hulls of the vessel contained integrated fuel tanks and the USCG ordered the fuel removed prior to allowing the vessel to be removed to remove all risk of oil spill.  Ultimately 1,500 gallons of fuel were removed from the vessel the evening of 15May2015 and the vessel was pulled free from the reef at 0700 16May2015 by multiple Sea Tow vessels.  NOAA/NOS ERD \u0026 ARD and NOAA/NMFS SERO \u0026 RC were all closely coordinated during the initial incident response in support of the USCG\u0027s successful prevention of an oil spill.  Approximately 1,500 corals, including 100 fragments of Acropora palmata, were reattached during the restoration and 10m3 of material were removed from the site to prevent additional damage to unimpacted areas during swells.",
