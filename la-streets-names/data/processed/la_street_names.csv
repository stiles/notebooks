https://lastreetnames.com/street/0001st-street/,1st Street,Los Angeles (Citywide),"First things first. The numbering system of L.A.’s streets was established by 1846. In 1883, addresses south of 1st Street – technically southwest, since DTLA’s grid is laid out at a 36° angle; more on that in a second – were given the postal designation “South”, while all addresses north of 1st were “North”. That’s why we have, for example, 789 N.La Breaand 789 S. La Brea. Likewise, addresses east ofMain Streetwere designated “East” and so on. Now about that 36° angle, which you can see on a map: this reveals L.A.’s Spanish roots. The Laws of the Indies, set forth in 1573 to develop Spanish colonies worldwide, decreed that streets be laid out at a 45° angle so that all structures may receive equal sunlight throughout the day. The geography of young Los Angeles didn’t quite allow for that, so early urban planners got as close as they could with 36°. Once L.A. expanded west of today’sHoover Street, the city – now an American one – adopted Thomas Jefferson’s rationalist north-south grid system.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1st-street-map.png
https://lastreetnames.com/street/001st-helena-drive/,1st Helena Drive,Brentwood,"Why are there twenty-five Helena Drives in Brentwood? One rumor says a developer cheated on his wife Helena, then apologized by naming every street in her honor. Cute story, not true. The cul-de-sacs were laid out in 1922 on the Brentwood Country Club Estates tract, owned by Richard P. Shea (1868-1932), whose wife was named Elizabeth. (They soon split and he married Jane McComas in 1924.) Shea simply borrowed “Helena” from nearby Helena Street, which originatedin 1907. That was on the Carlos Heights tract, set up by Chicago hotelier Tracy C. Drake (1864-1939), whose Blackstone and Drake hotels still operate in the Windy City. Since Drake named Carlos Heights for his son Carlos, it follows that his streets were tributes to other loved ones:Anita Avenuemay be for his wife Annie and Helena Street may be for his sister Helen Vernera Drake (1867-1960), a Chicago socialite. (I have no guesses for Carmelina Ave.) Coincidentally, Richard P. Shea had a daughter named Helen, so his 25 Helena Drives could be for her. Tragic postscript: On Christmas Eve 1932, two months after his wife Jane’s death, a despondent Shea tied her ashes around his neck and drowned himself in the Pacific.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1st-helena-drive-map.png

It being the 10th Olympiad was apparently coincidence; plans to expand 10th Street into a fully paved, citywide artery were already underway in 1928. In fact this expansion caused some legal drama, namely over the widening of the road: homeowners, as usual, were anti-development.

Lacking a map from that time, I can only go by mentions in newspapers: 4th Street was referenced in 1893, 1st Street in 1894, and so on. So I believe they were all there in 1887, if only on paper. As the streets physically materialized, however, they didn’t quite follow the original plan. For instance, it seems that 3rd Street didn’t show up until 1950! (It’s part ofTedemory Drivenow.)

He soon turned half of it into a residential tract called SouthShores and asked L.A. civil engineers to give the streets a school of fishy names to honor San Pedro’s piscary legacy. In order to prevent duplication with existing L.A. streets, some of these species will be unfamiliar to the casual seafood eater. In alphabetical order, they are: Abalone Ave., Anabas Ave., Anchovy Ave., Bowfin Ave., Graysby Ave., Gunnell Ave., Gurnard Ave., Mantis Ave. (presumably for the mantis shrimp), Moray Ave., Mulldae Ave. (a misspelling of mullidae, or red mullet), Perch St., Robalo Ave., Shad Pl., Spearing Ave., Stargazer Ave., and Warmouth St.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/abalone-avenue-map.png

https://lastreetnames.com/street/abbot-kinney-boulevard/,Abbot Kinney Boulevard,Venice,"Abbot Kinney (1850-1920) was the founder ofVenice. Born in New Jersey and raised in D.C., Kinney got rich from his family’s tobacco business and had seen the world by 1880, when he arrived in SoCal and found that the climate helped his asthma. In fact he first moved to the hills above Pasadena (seeKinneloa Avenue) before his interests inevitably shifted to Santa Monica, where he built a summer home in 1886 and cofoundedOcean Parkin 1893. Kinney soured on his later Ocean Park partners, so in February 1904 he reportedly staged a coin toss to divide their property between them. Kinney won the toss and unexpectedly chose the “worthless” marshland south of SM. A month later, he revealed his plans to transform it into a facsimile of Venice, Italy. The Venice of America – canals and all – opened on July 4th, 1905. It was a hit with the day trippers and Kinney got to die before seeing his oceanside fantasyland deteriorate. (He bequeathed his house to his employee and friendIrving Tabor, which caused a stir as Tabor was black.) Venice’s most famous street didn’t adopt Kinney’s name until 1990. Before that, it was called WestWashington Boulevard. (And it originated in 1903 as Toltec Place!)

A nameless road laid out in 1926, property owners initially thought to call it “Temple Street” as it led to both a Masonic temple and a planned Elks lodge (now the Kwan Yin meditation temple). They then settled upon Acacia Avenue, ostensibly because it fit in better with Monrovia’s other arboreal street names, but I suspect some of those property owners also knew that the acacia tree is an important symbol for Masons, who believe its wood was used in the Ark of the Covenant and that it signifies the immortality of the soul.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/acacia-avenue-map.png

Anyway, if you’re wondering why this presidential motorcade concludes with Jefferson, in fact more POTUS-inspired streets were intended: an 1871 “wishful thinking” map included Madison Street, Monroe Street, the awkwardly-named John Quincy Adams Street, and Jackson Street.

Three years later, after Glendale incorporated as a city, the other A-B-C streets were fleshed out as Adams, Belmont, and Cedar streets; Dayton Court; Everett Street; Franklin Court; and Geneva, Howard, Isabel, Jackson, Kenwood, Louise, Mary, and Orange streets. Dayton Court got absorbed by Everett Street around 1926. Mary Street was changed to Maryland Avenue in 1910; the reason is unclear, but it presents a strong case that Mary Street was initially paired withLouise Street(named in 1904) as a tribute to L.C.

Brooks Sheldon was born and raised in Minneapolis. His World War I draft card indicated that he was deaf, thus exempting him from service, but it’s unknown whether he was born deaf or lost his hearing in his youth.

The brothers – José Julián, Pedro María (a priest), and Pedro Antonio – were inspired to come here by J.E.Hollenbeck, who had met them during his long sojourn in Central America. After the Badillas purchased the rancho, Hollenbeck floated them a loan that they couldn’t repay after their coffee plants failed, so he took possession of the land in 1879. Three years later, he sold 2,000 acres of it to Joseph SwiftPhillips, who establishedCovinahere in 1884, laying out the misspelled Badillo Street that November. Epilogue: While Pedro Antonio eventually returned to Costa Rica, José Julián and Pedro María both moved to Arizona. Pedro Antonio’s daughter Francisca remained in Covina to work for J.S.

And so here you will find Brazil Street, Bahia Drive, Itapetinga Lane, and even Espinheira Drive, for Itapetinga mayor José Vaz Sampaio Espinheira (1914-1983), who was touring the U.S. with other Bahia politicians in late 1968 as part of the State Department’s International Visitor Program.

Bailey also took over a cigar store and a sewing machine shop that autumn. The following year, Bailey “ran away and smashed things badly” at the sewing machine shop and eventually headed to Northern California, where he married Mary E. Yontz in 1881 and set up a dry goods store in Chico. Sadly, Mary died in an insane asylum in 1885, which set Frank on a path of self-destruction, drinking heavily and racking up debts. (By this point he was working as a stockbroker in San Francisco.) In July 1889, Bailey forged his friend Anthony Sweeney’s signature on a $2,000 stock sale, left a phony suicide note, then absconded to L.A. with Sweeney’s money. The law caught up with him and in November he was sentenced to two years at San Francisco’s House of Correction. Those suicide threats may have been real: Bailey died in prison just two months later.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bailey-street-map.png

Jonathan Bailey (1819-1904) was born in Virginia but spent most of his life on a farm outside of Wilmington, Ohio. In 1842, he married Rebecca Frazier (1821-1898), an Ohio native, and they raised a small family. Devout Quakers, the Baileys lived modestly under rugged conditions and were active in local affairs, with Jonathan helping to raise funds to open, in 1871, Wilmington College – a Quaker university that continues to operate today. The Baileys visited Los Angeles three times during the 1870s and 1880s to see their son Ed, who lived there intermittently. (During a visit in February 1886, Jonathan was struck in the head by a rock hurled at a Chinese man by a racist mob; it nearly killed him.) The couple settled here for good in 1887 when they established Whittier with A.H.Pickering, T. ElwoodNewlin, John H.Painter, and HerveyLindley. In fact the Baileys are considered Whittier’s first residents, as they moved into the region’s only house at the time: the former home of farmer Jacob Gerkens.

A Brooklyn boy who came to Los Angeles with his widowed mother and brother in 1894, he married Cleora Oder (1886-1966) in 1910 and they had one daughter, Marjorie. He then entered the new field of motion picture acting and racked up over ninety silent film credits until 1917, when he switched to live theatre. In the 1920s, Bainbridge got into the real estate boom and worked first as salesman, then as publicist, for the Janss Investment Co., developers ofWestwoodandHolmbyHills. They named this street for him in 1926. Then came the third act of Bainbridge’s life, when the Great Depression alerted him to the plight of impoverished seniors and he took on the cause of pension reform. Through his own radio show and public lectures, he spoke for a group promoting the California Pension Plan, nicknamed the “Ham and Eggs Movement”, in which every CA resident over 50 would receive $30 every Thursday in scrip. Alas, the group was crippled by internal drama – Bainbridge was the only key player with no personal agenda – and voters rejected the proposition in 1938. Bainbridge later fought for the Townsend Plan, another pension scheme based in Chicago, but spent his final years back in SoCal.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bainbridge-avenue-map.png

They apparently followed eldest child Christine (later Hartman, 1867-1915), who got married here in the spring of 1888. To give you a sense of how rural this area was back then, in 1904 two of the Bakman boys were arrested for letting their cows poop in the L.A. River. One of those boys, Dan (1877-1932), would become the most prominent member of the family, as a partner at the Bank ofLankershimand as a driving force behind the creation ofRiverside Drive. Bakman Avenue, christened in 1924, is named for him if not for the Bakmans in general. And since every family has a black sheep, I must mention Dan’s nephew Daniel Frederick Bakman (1898-1939), who made headlines in 1930 when he killed his wife’s lover with a shotgun blast to the abdomen in Dark Canyon (nowBarham Boulevard). He was convicted of manslaughter and sent to San Quentin. In 1936, after his release, he kidnapped and sexually assaulted a NoHo woman.

Tract 1000 was the first step in transforming the SFV from arid pastureland into bustling suburbia; perhaps these men saw themselves as modern-day conquistadors, as other Tract 1000 streets were named for famous explorers, including Alvarado (nowWoodley), Cabrillo (nowHaskell), Cortez (nowFulton), Diaz (nowColdwater Canyon), andDe Soto. In 1986, a 27 acre lake was planned for the Sepulveda Basin Recreational Area, borrowing this street’s name; six years later, it was finally filled with water.

There are two schools of thought about the “Ballona” name. Some say it’s a misspelling ofballena, Spanish for “whale”, possibly spotted off the coast. Others say it’s derived from Baiona, Spain, allegedly the ancestral home of the Talamantes family. My own crackpot theory is that it may have been a Spanish phoneticization of “bayou”, referring to the marshy landscape.

Born near Wilmington, Delaware, Banning set sail for San Francisco in 1851. According to lore, the ship he was on was seized by debt collectors, which left Banning in the sleepy fishing village ofSan Pedro,where he got a job as a clerk. Twenty miles away, the young city of Los Angeles was struggling to grow without a port, so Banning saw an opportunity: partnering with David W. Alexander, he launched a service wagoning goods from the coast into town. As business boomed, Banning decided to build L.A. its own port. He led a team of investors in buying harbor land from theDomínguezfamily and in 1863 he named the portWilmington, after his hometown, while the long process of dredging the harbor and constructing a breakwater continued. Along with championing SoCal’s first railroad (between Wilmington and L.A., naturally) and serving on the CA State Senate, Banning also ran a stagecoach service between L.A. and Yuma, AZ; a stop along the route later became the city of Banning in Riverside County. Banning’s first wife Rebecca (néeSanford) gave him three surviving sons before she died in childbirth in 1868. The sons would buy Catalina Island in 1892. Second wife Mary (née Hollister; her uncle founded Hollister, CA) bore Banning two daughters – one of whom, Lucy, deserves her own book: she would marry four times and steal at least one husband (seeDolores Road). Phineas Banning suffered internal injuries after being struck by a wagon in San Francisco in 1883.

Kinney deeded them to the City of Venice (when it was still its own municipality) in 1912, basically to make taxpayers pay for their upkeep. After he died in 1920, there began a demand to convert his canals into streets. Venice set the plans in motion in March 1925 and coined new street names that June: Grand and Rialto canals, which took their names from Italy’s Venice, were to be renamed Grand Boulevard and Rialto Avenue. Venus, Aldebaran, and Altair canals – named after heavenly bodies – would now beSan Juan Avenue, Market Street, and Altair Place, respectively. Lion Canal would become an extension ofWindward Avenue, Cabrillo Canal would be Cabrillo Avenue, and Coral Canal would be Second Avenue (now part of Santa Monica’sMain Street).

For years it was known as the Cahuenga Road, and Cahuenga Valley was the pre-Hollywood name for Hollywood. That’s why this “valley street” goes all the way down to Hancock Park.

The story behind the latter is that in 1824, a Basque farmer named Antonio Jauregui was hauling hiscalabazasbetween San Fernando and Ventura – possibly where today’s Calabasas Road lies – when a rattlesnake scared his horses, overturning his wagon and covering the road with broken squash. Months later, hundreds of squashes popped up where Jauregui’s seeds had fallen, so locals started calling the area “Calabasas”. Sounds like a tall tale to me, but I wasn’t there. At any rate, the first time Calabasas was mentioned in print was in January 1874 – and in classic L.A. style, it involved a homicide. A fellow named Anisetto Roman was shot in “Calabasas Cañon” by M.J. Banks, a rancher known for running afoul of the law.

Considering the effort that went into coining “Pasadena“, these founders evidently strove for mellifluous names, and Colorado, California, and Columbia certainly make for a harmonious trio.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/calzona-street/,Calzona Street,Boyle Heights,"It’s not a misspelling of the Italian snack (calzone) or the Spanish word for “underpants” (calzón). “Calzona” is a portmanteau of California and Arizona. Calada Street, one block west, is similarly a contraction of California and Nevada. The two streets were previously called El Paseo Street and Colina Street, respectively. They were renamed in 1923 while theUnion PacificRailroad was laying down tracks nearby. Calzona and Calada were early 20th century railroad stops, so they may have been the inspirations for these street names, although it should be noted that Edgar Eugene Calvin (1858-1938), VP of the Union Pacific, oversaw the development of both streets, so “Cal” might also be a nod to his surname.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/camarillo-street/,Camarillo Street,North Hollywood,"Named after the town of Camarillo; it was one of several Valley streets that took their names from Ventura County locales in 1916 (seeSaticoy Street). The town itself was named for the family who owned it. In 1876, Juan Camarillo (1812-1880), a native of Mexico City, bought the 9,998 acre Rancho Calleguas in southern Ventura County. He died before he could do much with it, so his widow Martina Hernandez Camarillo (1825-1898) deeded it to their sons Adolfo (1864-1958) and Juan Jr. (1867-1936) – much to the chagrin of the four Camarillo daughters, who wanted a piece of the pie and sued several times to get it. Ultimately it was Adolfo who turned the middling rancho into an agricultural goldmine, then into a town. He also owned a bit of the SFV, where the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is now located, but nothing near Camarillo Street – a four-mile stretch of which was renamedRiverside Drivein November 1924.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/camarillo-street-map.png

(The street was christened in 1902; apparently Gramps didn’t know how the boy’s name was spelled.) As a lieutenant in World War I, the New York-raised McLoughlin helped command the all-black 369th Infantry – the “Harlem Hellfighters” – and received the Distinguished Service Cross for saving his men’s lives on the battlefield. He drilled for oil around San Antonio, TX during the 1930s and returned to service in Germany during WWII. It’s unclear how or where he died. SeeGregory Avenue, named for Comerford’s brother, for more on the McLoughlin family, but since their sister Cornelia Beekman Rylee (1893-1938) doesn’t have a namesake street here, let’s take a moment to note that she was the first woman in California to obtain a pilot’s license.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/camerford-avenue-map.png

Born near Inverness, Scotland, Cameron immigrated to Northern California with his family in 1873. Baldwin hired Cameron’s father as foreman in 1884 and the clan moved to La Puente, but Dad was sickly and passed away just three years later, leaving 23-year-old “Al” to inherit his job. Cameron Avenue was named in 1907 near its present-day intersection withLark Ellen Avenue. Baldwin died two years later and Al Cameron was promoted to manager of his late employer’s warehouses. Around 1912, Al, his wife Lucy, and their three sons retired to their own farm in San Benito County.

Gibbon (1860-1921), an Arkansas native who came to L.A. in 1888 and became one of the city’s top lawyers. Gibbon had purchased the former Hay ranch (seeFormosa Ave.) c. 1902, intending to build a rural home here for his family, but Hollywood citified so quickly that he wound up subdividing it. Camino Palmero still shows off its unusually wide road verges – the palm-lined grassy areas between sidewalk and street – although it has lost its distinctive gateway designed by architects Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey, who between them also built the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Rose Bowl, and theHuntingtonMansion and Library.

After the death of his father and subsequent loss of his family’s San Marino property, Campbell Shorb moved to San Francisco in 1900, along with his mother and most of his siblings.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/campbell-street/,Campbell Street,Glendale,"Daniel Campbell (1872-1932) was a key figure in the growth of Glendale. Born in (Northern) Ireland, Campbell immigrated to California c. 1894 then went up to the Yukon for the Klondike Gold Rush. He struck it rich – a January 1898 article claimed that he discovered $125,000 in gold (surely an overstatement, as that would be worth millions today) – and met fellow prospector Joseph Brand (1868-1913), the ne’er-do-well brother of Leslie CoombsBrand. “Joe” told “Dan” to move to Los Angeles and get in touch with his brother. He did, and the two became fast friends. As L.C. Brand was developing Glendale, he hired the young Irishman to run the city’s first bank. Campbell married another Northern Irish immigrant, Margaret McPeak (1876-1933), around 1900. (Curiously, Campbell’s mother’s maiden name was also McPeak.) In 1903, they moved into their new Glendale home and dubbed it “Ard Eevin“. Margaret’s family – ma, da, and seven siblings – came to L.A. the following year. Dan Campbell was active in several local banks and propelled Glendale’s building boom in the early 1920s; his brother Arthur was involved in city utilities.

Said rancho was established in 1853 by the del Valle family and was reportedly the model for the picturesque ranch owned by the widowed – and passive-aggressively evil – Señora Moreno in Helen Hunt Jackson’s 1884 novelRamona.

The Buffalo-born, Minnesota-raised Canfield came to L.A. in 1887; five years later, he and his old mining buddy EdwardDohenywould discover the first oil within city limits. (Canfield was preparing to declare bankruptcy at the time.) He later became a partner in theRodeoLand & Water Company, which purchased and developed the future Beverly Hills. But Canfield’s wealth came at a cost: In 1906, his wife Chloe was shot to death on the front porch of their Westlake mansion by former coachman Morris Buck, who insisted he was owed money. (Buck was hanged for his crime in 1907.) Daughter Daisy Canfield (1884-1933) also led an eventful life. In 1922, while finalizing her divorce from her philandering first husband Jay Danziger, she sold off her Westside land to Alphonzo Bell, who then transformed it intoBel-Air.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/canoga-avenue/,Canoga Avenue,Canoga Park,"Canoga Park was born in 1893 as the Canoga station on the Southern Pacific’sBurbank–Chatsworthline. Why “Canoga”? There are many theories. Here’s the likeliest:Canogais a Cayuga Iroquois word meaning “sweet water” (there’s a Canoga Spring near New York’s Lake Cayuga), but someone at the Southern Pacific saw it translated as “watering hole”. There was supposedly an old well at the site of the station, so the name fit. Additionally, the station was a water stop for steam trains. True or not, the town that grew up around the station was known as Canoga until some Valley landowner, reportedlyL.A. Timespublisher Harrison GrayOtis, dubbed itOwensmouthin 1911. (Canoga Avenue was named that same year.)

Daisy Avenue (then “Street”) was probably named then too, as wasNina Streetfor Daisy’s sister. The Rose kids grew up at Sunny Slope and at the Rose mansion in DTLA. Daisy was a society column fixture and her frequent travels with Amanda suggest that, of the five Rose daughters, she was Mother’s favorite. In 1892, she wed insurance man James W.

Dalbey was born in Placer County, CA and worked as a schoolteacher and/or principal in various NorCal towns beween 1910 and 1930, when he was hired as principal of Newhall Elementary. He and his new bride Margaret a.k.a. “Rita” (1890-1982), a nurse originally from Canada, arrived that September. In 1945, seeing the need for a local high school but not wanting to be part of LAUSD, Dalbey established Hart High under the aegis of its own district. He then served as both principal and superintendent before abruptly resigning in December 1950: he claimed he was simply “worn out” but a later report called him “disappointed and embittered”. The Dalbeys returned to Placer County and Lester spent his final years in real estate.

Evans was born Frances Smith in Uvalde, TX. Initially a radio singer, she adopted her stage name by 1935, when she had a show in Louisville, KY. Her career eventually went national and she came to Hollywood in 1941. Three years later, she was paired with Rogers for the first time on the movieThe Cowboy and the Senorita. Rogers, born Leonard Slye, grew up in Ohio near the Kentucky border. He moved toLawndalein the early 1930s and gained some notoriety in 1934 with his singing group the Sons of the Pioneers. He too went Hollywood – but stardom didn’t come until 1938, the year he was rechristened Roy Rogers and purchased his equine costar Trigger (born Golden Cloud in San Diego). Rogers would become filthy rich – not just from his movie salaries but from his vast merchandising empire, as he had shrewdly retained the licensing rights to his name and likeness. He and Evans married in 1947 and bought their 130 acre Chatsworth ranch in 1955. Dale Court and Trigger Street were christened in 1964 when the cowpoke couple decided to subdivide the property. They retired to Apple Valley (near Victorville) the following year. As for Trigger, he was stuffed after his death and put on display at the now-defunct Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum.

(See Azusa’sDalton Avenuefor more on him.) In truth, George Dalton first stepped foot in California in 1827 while working as a merchant sailor, but he didn’t immigrate to the U.S. until 1837 – and spent years in Pennsylvania and Ohio before arriving at Azusa c. 1851. By 1857, he owned 48 acres of vineyards and citrus orchards at present-dayCentralandWashington, which his son-in-law Hall also subdivided in 1887. Dalton briefly served as a city councilman in 1868.

Born in London, Dalton sailed to Lima, Peru as a young man. There he became a merchant enriched by sea trade. He came to Los Angeles in December 1843; a year later, he bought portions of RanchoAzusaand RanchoSan Joséfrom LuisArenas. The former he dubbed Rancho Azusa de Dalton, to differentiate it from Rancho Azusa deDuarte. Eventually Dalton would grow crops and raise cattle on four big ranchos spread out over 45,000 acres. In 1847, he married 15-year-old María Guadalupe Zamorano (1832-1914), with whom he would have eleven children. Unfortunately, like so many people who snapped up California land during Mexican rule, Dalton had a disastrous time proving ownership after CA’s 1850 statehood and spent decades battling both squatters and bureaucrats. (His frustration is immortalized in the 1880 U.S. Census, in which his profession is listed as “Fighting for his rights”.) Dalton ultimately lost his legal disputes, his fortune, and nearly all of his land. Rancho Azusa de Dalton wound up in the hands of Jonathan SayreSlauson, who established the town of Azusa in 1887.

If true, then it’s only indirectly named for him, e.g., someone was inspired by Dana Point. But it’s more likely that “Dana” was simply available when city leaders decided to rename the former Orange Avenue in February 1897. (They were especially wishy-washy that month: the name went from Orange to Dana to Compton to Stanley to Chicago and then back to Dana!) There was once a different Dana Street abutting a 35 acre property owned by the estate of one “Col. S. Dana” at the present location of the Shrine Auditorium. It was coopted into 32nd Street in 1891, freeing up the Dana name. “Col. S. Dana” was most likely Samuel Dana (1838-1870), a payroll officer with the U.S. Army who mostly split his time between Arizona and San Francisco but presumably invested in some L.A. land.

There’s not much else to say about Degnan, except that his wife Dorothy died just four months after he did. (Couldn’t live without him.) I found no direct connections between him and Leimert Park, but Oscar and Hilda Lawler socialized for years with Walter and LucilleLeimert, so it’s certainly possible that Lawler asked Leimert to name this street (in 1928) after Degnan.

After nine years in Spain, the del Amos returned to L.A. in 1921, establishing Del Amo Nurseries and leasing out the Domínguez land for oil drilling. This made the family incredibly wealthy, so they turned to philanthropy, with Susana’s focus on Claretian missionaries and Gregorio’s on Spanish–American relations.

Echeandía didn’t wish to live in foggy Monterey, the territory’s capital, so he operated out of San Diego. He briefly co-governed in 1832-1833 after the unpopular Manuel Victoria was deposed, then went back to Mexico and civil engineering. A “dream map” of Los Angeles, first laid out in 1855 and revised in 1871, reveals city planners’ intentions of naming five thoroughfares after California’s old Mexican governors:Pico,Micheltorena,Alvarado,Figueroa, and Echandia.

Since the City neglected to claim the land around the reservoir, real estate speculator Thomas Kelley snapped part of it up (with financial backing from Dr. WilliamLeMoyneWills and JosephHyans, among others) and began offering “lakeside” lots in 1887 on what he dubbed theMontanatract. After some legal squabbles, Kelley agreed to donate 33 acres back to the city for parkland in 1891. Echo Park was announced the following year, its name supposedly coined by city parks superintendent Joseph Henry Tomlinson for the echoes he heard around the reservoir.

Wicks didn’t invent the name: it’s been used in English-speaking countries since at least 1828; a short story published that year – author unknown – cited the fictitious Edendale Valley in Herefordshire, UK.

Eaton applied his renowned irrigation skills to the drought-ravaged Fair Oaks and reaped the rewards from its vineyards and orange groves. In 1873, he was visited by Daniel Berry, whose “California Colony ofIndiana” was looking for land to, well, colonize.

Now, you might be thinking, “Elmhurst What? The street between Delaware and Fairmount is Walnut Avenue.” In fact the plan was to rename Walnut to Elmhurst, but since Burbank already had an ElmwoodAvenue, Walnut remained Walnut. Seven additional streets were never christened: Indiana, Judson, Kentucky, Lawrence, Mills, Norwich, and Ogden. P.S.

He eventually crossed paths with white Bakersfield builder Wayne Lee Vaughn and by 1955 the two were partners on housing tracts in Bakersfield, Santa Maria, and elsewhere. Santa Clarita’s Fambrough Street was named in 1965 on the Oakridge tract, owned by Vaughn and James E. Smith. Fambrough wasn’t listed as owner, but he was named as a defendant along with Vaughn and Smith in a lawsuit over the land (they won), so we can assume he had a stake here.

South of Wilshire, the road was known as 9th Street, asSawtellewas then its own city.

It was named either for the men’s hat or for the stage drama that inspired said hat. Here’s the story: In 1882, playwright Victorien Sardou wroteFédoraas a vehicle for the legendary French actress Sarah Bernhardt. It was a hit, and when the English version premiered in New York a year later, with Fanny Davenport (a legend in her own right) in the title role, Americans went gaga for all thingsFédora. (Davenport brought the play to Los Angeles in July 1888; the plot concerns the fictional Russian princess Fédora Romazoff, who falls in love with her husband’s assassin.) It’s an oft-repeated myth that Bernhardt donned a man’schapeauin the Paris show and thus the fedora was initially a unisex hat marketed to women. Not true. The first fedora-named hats were introduced in late 1883, they were inspired by the American production, and they were for men. For a while there was a style of ladies’ fashion called a “fedora front” – a curtain-like blouse. But from 1891 onwards, “fedora” primarily referred to men’s hats. P.S. There’s no evidence of Fedora Street ever having had a hat factory or hat store on it.",

Native to southern Brazil and Uruguay, the plant derives its name from Portuguese naturalist João da Silva Feijó (1760-1924). It was first brought to SoCal in the very early 1900s. Here in Lomita, feijoas were successfully cultivated by William Boyes (1859-1936), an Englishman who lived due west of here on Cypress Street.

That part sounds like hooey, as there’s absolutely no mention of “Mocohuenga” anywhere or anytime before 1911. Still, you can spot a remnant of the old moniker on the signpost for tiny Moco Lane, just off Fern Dell Drive. As for Fern Dell itself, the name first appeared in 1920 and may have been coined by Van M. Griffith (1888-1974), son of Griffith Park benefactor Griffith J. Griffith (1850-1919), as he had more or less taken charge of the park by this point.

Born and raised in Maine, Fickett established a career there as a carpenter. He then moved out to Northern California in the 1860s and settled in Oakland, which is where he likely first crossed paths with Mathews, a budding young architect. Fickett finally came to Los Angeles in 1874. Here he became a successful contractor, supplying carpenters and plasterers for several major buildings and making enough money from his business to buy a few racehorses. Indeed, most of what is known about Charles Fickett comes from old newspaper racing columns; details of his personal life are hazier. All that’s clear is that in 1889 he married Agnes Davidson, a young widow with a toddler named Hal.

Legend holds that if these crop-devouring insects made it past this road and into the vineyards, the year’s grape harvest would be doomed. Anyway, by 1867, a separate road called Figueroa Street had popped up a few blocks west, honoring General José Figueroa (1792-1835), who served as governor of Alta California at the end of his short life. During his two-year administration, Figueroa united the government, secularized the missions, and began offering land grants to Mexican soldiers: all major moments in California history. Back to the streets: Grasshopper was renamed Pearl Street in 1874; twenty-three years later, in 1897, Pearl became Figueroa while the old Figueroa becameBoylston. Then, grasshopper-like, this new Figueroa would devour every street in its path as it expanded.

Initially hired as an auditor for a streetcar company, in 1893 he turned to real estate, partnering briefly with Boyle Workman (son of William H.Workman) then going solo in 1894. Success came quickly: as GaylordWilshire‘s exclusive agent, he sold a choice Wilshire Blvd. property toL.A. Timespublisher Harrison GrayOtisin 1897. Called “the Bivouac”, it would one day be home to the Otis College of Art and Design. Also in 1897, the former Holmes Street was renamed Garland Avenue on one of Garland’s tracts. Garland married Blanche Hinman (1870-1958) the following year and they would have two sons. Apart from his prodigious triumphs in real estate, Garland’s biggest contribution to Los Angeles was securing the 1932 SummerOlympicsfor the city, which he had almost singlehandedly pushed for since 1920.

Garthwaite was a New Yorker who relocated to Oakland in 1882 and became an executive at the Oakland Bank of Savings, where a young Leimert worked as a clerk in 1901, shortly before getting into real estate. In 1912, Garthwaite was on the board of directors of the brand new Hotel Oakland (a historic landmark now repurposed as senior apartments), which counted Leimert among its investors. It’s not clear if Garthwaite returned the favor by investing in Leimert Park, but he did co-own Leimert’sCity Terracetract. Heartbroken by the death of his son John in 1946, W.W.

The name is indeed derived from the garbanzo bean, a.k.a. the chickpea, which supposedly grew wild in the area. InEine Blume aus dem Goldenen Lande(“A Flower from the Golden Land”), an 1878 travel memoir by Austria’s Archduke Ludwig Salvator, the author mentioned a “Cienegadel Garvanzo” here; back then, the garbanzo bean was still a new concept to gringos, and so was its spelling.

There he married native Hoosier Naomi Henley (1819-1901) in 1839 while managing a general store. Eventually he got into banking, and in 1865 he took his family to Lawrence, KS, whereupon he established the National Bank of Lawrence and appointed himself its president. Four years later, he was elected mayor of Lawrence. With the Hadleys’ daughter Meda marrying a son of A.H.Pickeringin 1872 and another daughter, Laurie, marrying ElwoodNewlinin 1878, Whittier’s town fathers were as much family as “Friends“. The Hadleys finally settled in Whittier full-time in 1892 and Washington incorporated the Bank of Whittier in 1895.

The first mention I found of the canyon was in an 1886San Francisco Chroniclearticle about “water grabbers” in Los Angeles County. One D.J. Haines was listed as its owner; I believe this was Daniel Jenkins Haines (1843-?). Born on Cape Cod, Haines either came to the San Jose area with his family in 1861 or fought in the Civil War and arrived later. Voter registration records showed him in Santa Clara County in 1866 and in Los Angeles in 1879. An 1885 land assessment record had him owning 160 acres – presumably in this area, but it’s not clear. The only public attention Haines received was when he was a witness at the 1894 trial over a daring train robbery near theRoscoedepot. He was identified as a wood hauler who was camping nearby when the crime occurred; this jibes with local historian Mike Lawler’s theory that Haines Canyon was named for “one of those early woodcutters” who harvested the Douglas fir trees that once grew here “and then moved on.” Moved on indeed: in 1898, a year after Haines’s brother Nathaniel fell to his death at his winery south of San Jose, another brother, Prince Albert(!) Haines, placed ads in newspapers seeking his whereabouts, as he was entitled to a third of Nathaniel’s $50,000 estate. Yet it seems Daniel J.

The street, originally called Puente Road, was renamed in December 1959 by the County Regional Planning Commission – no reason given.

He immigrated to Seguin, TX in 1899 to be a German Methodist minister and was soon joined by his parentsJacobandCarolineand his four siblings. In 1901, he married Emma Nagel, a Seguin local; they would have three children. Karl then had a stint as a photojournalist, capturing images of the Mexican Revolution in 1911. The Halms decamped for Los Angeles soon afterwards, where Karl’s devotion to the Fatherland led him to cofound several local German organizations – and during the first year of World War I, “Professor Halm” gave lectures to Teutonic expats in California and Texas that proclaimed both Germany’s righteousness and its assured victory. Those lectures ceased after a German U-Boat sank the British passenger shipLusitaniaon May 7th, 1915, but he continued to speak out against American support of Allied forces – at least until the U.S. entered the war in 1917, at which point he and Emma kept their heads down and quietly launched a wooden coat hanger company.

Hammel also served on the Los Angeles City Council – so why does he have a street in Beverly Hills? Because in 1883, he and Denker purchased RanchoRodeode las Aguas: the future BH. Here they grew numerous vegetables (not just lima beans, as claimed) while dreaming of transforming the vast rancho into a town called “Morocco”. Alas, both died before they could realize that dream, and in January 1906 their heirs sold the land to a syndicate led byBurtonGreen, who would rechristen it Beverly Hills by September. Hamel Road/Drive was named in 1922 as a nod to Hammel’s place in local history – but where did that second “m” go?

Hamlin, a native Minnesotan, was a mostly self-taught civil engineer.

James Hammell (1828-1912) was an Ohioan who in 1850 walked – walked! – to California alongside a wagon train, seduced by the Gold Rush at Sutter’s Mill. He mined enough gold to go back east and marry Indiana native Martha May (1838-1909); their honeymoon was spent on a ship back to San Francisco. James eventually gave up mining for real estate and the couple moved to Santa Barbara in 1868. Of the two Hammell kids born there, Hattie died in infancy while Delbert lived until 1947. In 1876, James opened a stagecoach hotel on his Ventura County farmland. Although he sold the property after two years, the hotel still stands as the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/hancock-avenue/,Hancock Avenue,West Hollywood,"Seemingly named for the famous “Hancock Park” Hancocks who once owned this land – but there’s a snag. First, some background: Henry Hancock (1822-1883) was a Harvard-educated lawyer and surveyor who came to L.A. in 1850 and amassed great power. He married Ida Haraszthy (1843-1913), the daughter of Hungarian aristocrats, in 1863. By that point, Henry had finagled a deal that gave him and his siblings ownership of RanchoLa Brea, but he left his heirs in debt when he died. Ida then proved herself a clever steward of the Hancocks’ vast holdings. Assisted by her son George Allan Hancock (1875-1965), she turned the family fortunes around, especially once oil was discovered on their property. She married Judge ErskineRossin 1909; G. Allan subdivided the family’s remaining land as posh Hancock Park in 1919. Back here in WeHo, in 1906, Ida donated a church organ to the St. Victor Catholic Church around the corner onHolloway Drive– and of course this was old Rancho La Brea land – so it’s easy to argue that Hancock Ave. honors her. But here’s that snag: the street was named on a 1907 tract owned by realtor (and resident) A.A. Barnett. His tract map cited two other owners: Lucie R. Ludlow… and Mary E. Hancock (1848-1926). Born Mary Hardman in Illinois, neither she nor her husband Frederick had any ties to L.A.’s Hancock clan. Did Barnett kill two Hancocks with one stone when he named this street?

Around that time, the rest of the Johnstons had migrated to L.A. to live with Griffin; Hancock grew up to subdivide East L.A. with his uncle, raise horses, have five kids with his wife Mary (daughter of BenjaminEaton), and suffer from arthritis.

All were named by landowners Alvaro (1876-1932) and Laura (1882-1949) Pratt. Alvaro Alma Pratt was a civil engineer who hailed from a prominent Utah family; Anna Laura Tharsing was born in Minnesota to Danish immigrants. After going bankrupt on a failed summer resort in Salt Lake City, Alvaro moved to L.A. by 1910 and was living in Laurel Canyon by 1912. He and Laura married in 1914. The couple had two children: Dick (1920-1998) and Lark (1923-2019), hence the names of two of these cul-de-sacs – although it is curious that Lark Lane was named before Lark Pratt was. As for Padre and Happy? Perhaps the former referred to Papa Alvaro and the latter came from “happy as a lark”. Anyway, the Pratts moved to WeHo after subdividing their property here. Alvaro then became one of the main visionaries behindMulholland Drive; ironically or not, he perished when his car plunged off another steep road in the Santa Susana Pass. Laura and the kids relocated to Santa Fe in 1941. Dick served as a translator during WWII, aided in Japan’s postwar reconstruction, and worked for Chrysler and Ford in Detroit.

He was living in San Francisco by 1875; early the following year, he married Santa Cruz native Lillian Nickerson (1857-1937) and they soon decamped for San Fernando. The Harpses and their two children were prominent in the small young town, rubbing shoulders with theMaclays,Porters,Griswolds,Hubbards, andWrights. Jacob was also a tinkerer, filing patents for a hand truck and a fruit pitting machine. He even took part in the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898-1899. But he eventually had enough of Lillian and sued her for divorce in 1914. Apparently they lived two doors down from each other in the 1910 census, so they’d been estranged for a while.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/harps-street-map.png

I couldn’t find out much about this street’s namesake, except that she was born Ianita Roselle Habeck in South Dakota and moved to the San Gabriel Valley with her parents and brother in 1937. She dabbled in stage acting until marrying Allan Boyar in April 1950. They lived in Sherman Oaks, had three daughters, and divorced in 1969. Ianita married Ralph L.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/imperial-highway/,Imperial Highway,Downey,"“Imperial” refers to Imperial County. The road is named thus because it was part of a grand scheme, set in motion in 1929, to expedite the transport of Imperial County’s fresh produce to Angelenos along a 220 mile paved thoroughfare between El Centro andEl Segundo. The saga of Imperial Highway is convoluted and somewhat wonky, but the short version is that it was finally completed in December 1961 – only to have various segments lose the Imperial name. In Los Angeles, portions of 114th Street and 116th Street were renamed Imperial Highway in 1930 and 1931, respectively. The road keeps its name for 41 miles until it reaches the city of Orange, whereupon it becomes Cannon Street. Imperial County owes its own name to newsman/subdivider Luther M.

It was called the Triangle Film Corporation, and Ince’s partners were D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett. (The lot was later taken over by MGM; it’s now home to Sony Pictures.) Ince went solo in 1918 and established his eponymous new studio on a dirt road he christened Ince Boulevard. That lot, with its iconic mansion, is today’s Culver Studios. Thomas Ince died shortly after taking a cruise on William Randolph Hearst’s yacht, theOneida. Rumors persist that Hearst accidentally shot Ince on board while attempting to kill CharlieChaplin, who was supposedly having an affair with Hearst’s mistress MarionDavies.

Rose, and others. Farmer/landowner DanielFreemanwas also instrumental in its development. Some historians believe Inglewood was named by a sister-in-law of Vail’s in honor of her hometown in Canada. However, while Vail’s two known sisters-in-law were Nova Scotians, that province’s Inglewood – so small it barely even rates as a community – is some 70 miles away from either woman’s hometown. In short, we don’t know the inspiration for our Inglewood’s name. As for this street, it was originally calledDamask Avenue. Although Inglewood Ave. was mentioned as early as 1900, Damask wasn’t officially rechristened until 1933.

https://lastreetnames.com/street/inglewood-boulevard/,Inglewood Boulevard,Culver City,"Inglewood Blvd. terminates two miles from Inglewood city limits, so why the name? It happened sometime in the 1920s. I say “sometime” because a November 1922 newspaper article noted the planning of an “Inglewood to Venice highway”, yet a classified ad published nine months earlier already mentioned the corner ofWashingtonand Inglewood boulevards. And while a 1925 map of the Westside showed Inglewood Blvd. still going by its old name,Burkshire Avenue(part of which still exists), a 1928 map labeled it Inglewood Blvd. In summary, Inglewood Boulevard was designed to connect Inglewood to Venice, the name was quietly adopted between 1922 and 1926, and the full plan fizzled out along the way.

The school, which first opened at 28th andSan Pedrostreets in 1902, was to be called the Deets Pacific Bible College, and the portion ofMarathon Streetdue south of Institute Place was named College Drive. But the church never built that college here: Bresee sold the land in 1910 and established the school in Pasadena. (It ultimately moved to San Diego and is now Point Loma Nazarene University.) Curiously, although College Drive adopted Marathon’s name in 1912, Institute Place was christened in 1911, when there was no more talk of institutes here.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/institute-place-map.png

To complete the duo, neighboring H Street became Hidalgo Street. (It was later absorbed byNormandie Avenue– more on that in a second.) Irolo is a tiny depot town with no known relevance to Los Angeles; my guess is that some civil engineer read it somewhere, thought it sounded pretty, and added it to a file of potential street names. That’s no joke – they really did (and do) keep such files. Anyway, Irolo Street’s relationship with Normandie used to be simple: Normandie was south ofPicoand Irolo was north.

Born in Los Angeles, Irving Hellman was trained as a civil engineer and worked as a city building inspector until 1907, when he and his brother Marco took over Merchants National Bank in the wake of their father’s death. Bank of America acquired them in 1928. After working as a VP at BofA, Hellman then became a broker at Merrill Lynch for 25 years. As befits a well-known financier, he also served on many boards and foundations.

Because the Louisiana-born Tabor was black, the public knew him only as Kinney’s chauffeur. Racist policies of the time forbade Tabor to live along the Venice canals, so when Kinney bequeathed his house to him upon his 1920 death, Tabor and his second wife Ethel (1896-1972) had it uprooted and hauled to the black neighborhood of Oakwood, where it still stands on Santa Clara and 6th. Tabor later worked at Bank of America before setting up his own maintenance company.

As for the Irwins, Ferguson was a Pittsburgh carpenter and Nellie was born in Denver. They married in Dakota Territory around 1880 and moved to L.A. by 1888. After a few good years growing berries and vegetables, the two divorced in 1905. According to newspapers, Ferguson was a drunk who wanted to sell the farm, but the property was in Nellie’s name and she refused, so he pulled out a pistol and threatened to blow her brains out. Ferguson vanished after the divorce while Nellie remained in the area with their kids Carl, Leola, and Leila (or Lelah) and lived off her own income.

Richmond (1818-1889), a shopkeeper who had already been here for four years – but as Edwin’s second wife Harriet died that very November, he may have asked Italia to tend to her ailing stepmother. Regardless, the visit turned into a permanent residency, so Italia’s husband, pharmacist Benjamin Franklin Cook (1837-1904), joined them here in 1887. Their eldest daughter Mary was then in college and didn’t make it to Covina until around 1909, after her own husband died. Italia Richmond was born in upstate New York; she married B.F. Cook in 1866 and they lived in Milwaukee before their Iowa sojourn. Italia Street was named in 1901 on the Richmond tract, owned by the Cooks on land that Italia had inherited from her father.

City planners may have established the names as early as 1853 (the oldest reference I found to Washington – then “Street”, not “Boulevard” – was in an 1860 newspaper), but the roads sat empty until the late 1860s, as young Los Angeles didn’t expand as rapidly as some had hoped. Anyway, if you’re wondering why this presidential motorcade concludes with Jefferson, in fact more POTUS-inspired streets were intended: an 1871 “wishful thinking” map included Madison Street, Monroe Street, the awkwardly-named John Quincy Adams Street, and Jackson Street. But since L.A. city limits ended just south of Jefferson, and civic leaders couldn’t name anything beyond that, those additional four streets never materialized.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jefferson-boulevard-map-1.png

Content in early retirement, an out-of-practice Jeffries was coaxed back into the ring in 1910 to fight Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champ. Promoters wanted Jeffries to reclaim the title for the white race and dubbed him “The Great White Hope”, but the powerful Johnson knocked out Jeffries after 15 rounds. The outcome ignited a nationwide riot, as humiliated white boxing fans attacked jubilant black boxing fans – who then fought back.

In fact its original name was Junkers Ave., in keeping with the neighborhood’s aviation theme. Junkers (pronounced “YOON-kers”) was a German aircraft manufacturer. When America entered World War II, Junkers didn’t make for a very patriotic street name, so it was changed to Jenny in January 1942. (That’s also when Fokker Ave. becameFleetwing.) “Jenny” was the nickname of the Curtiss JN biplane flown by American pilots in WWI.

It received a gender switch in 1918 when Hansen Heights was annexed by the City of Los Angeles: there was already a John Street in L.A., so this one had to go. Anyway, since Homer Hansen clearly named several streets on his tract after relatives – seeMcBroom Streetfor more – it follows that John Street was named in memory of his father. John Hansen (1838-1906) spent most of his life in Hocking County, Ohio – first as a teacher and then, after fighting in the Civil War, as an attorney. He gave up law for steel when his brothers asked him to represent their steel manufactory at the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. This led to a job managing a steel mill in Vinton, Iowa until he moved to Sunland with his wife Mary (née McBroom) in 1904.

All sources agree that the Kadota was first cultivated in 1905 bySawtellefounder Rev. Stephen H. Taft (1825-1918). The story goes that Taft went to Whittier in 1898, bought ten cuttings of a fig tree called a Dottato, then planted them at his Sawtelle nursery. One cutting grew into a new genetic variant with an especially sweet fig that Taft dubbed the Kadota. What’s behind the name? A 1919 article surmised that it was just a corruption of “Dottato”, sometimes spelled “Dotato”: Taft took the “dota” and put a “Ka” in front of it, for reasons known only to him. Kadota is also a Japanese surname, and there’s a long tradition of Japanese nurserymen in Sawtelle, so it’s not impossible that Taft named the fruit after an employee. At any rate, theSylmarPacking Corporation, formerly the L.A. Olive Growers Association, planted 30 acres of Kadota figs here in 1922.

At the time of his 1915 death, with properties all over Los Angeles and 6,000 acres in Tulare County, he was reportedly worth $1.25 million. Henry Haack went on to manage his parents’ interests and also partnered with Sherrill Osborne (seeOsborne Street) in a realty firm.

A separate tract called Kenilworth soon followed, located near Griffith J.Griffith‘s ostrich farm, which was run by English naturalist Dr. Charles Sketchley. In fact the farm – now Griffith Park’s Crystal Springs Picnic Area – was known as the Kenilworth Ostrich Farm. Although short-lived as a tourist attraction (1885-1889), it instigated the development of this part of town: That canyon-like stretch ofSunset Boulevardthrough Silver Lake and Echo Park was carved out for the train that brought downtowners to the giant birds.

They were born in Macomb, IL but made their names as publishers and hoteliers in Chicago, where there also happens to be a Kenmore Avenue. In fact Frank himself lived on the Windy City’s Kenmore in 1892, so there’s your probable cause. (“Kenmore” is Scottish in origin; it’s been theorized that the Chicago-based Sears borrowed the street’s name for its brand of appliances.) After their hotel business failed, the Chapmans came to SoCal in 1894 and made it big as citrus growers. Charles would later give his name to Orange County’s Chapman University. He and Samuel opened the Chapman Park Hotel here on their property in 1927 – it’s long gone, but their 1929 Chapman Market still stands. In 1912, the City decreed that the originalHolmbyAvenue (named for department store king Arthur Letts’s Los Feliz mansion), Windermere Avenue, and El Molino Street (the “E” betweenDewey‘s “D” andFedora‘s “F”) all become part of Kenmore Ave.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kenmore-avenue-map.png

The Dows moved to North Glendale in 1896 and lived on a 10 acre citrus grove for fourteen years. (They weren’t just humble farmers: when Albert died, his obituary called him “one of the wealthiest ranchers and residents of this valley”.) The grove was at the corner of Central Avenue and an unnamed dirt lane. As the story goes, a county supervisor up for reelection visited the Dows in 1900 and asked if there was anything he could do for them. Walter jokingly requested that the dirt lane be called “Kenneth Road”, after his middle name. One week later, he found a brand new street sign reading exactly that. I don’t know if the tale is true, but the Dows definitely lived on Kenneth Road; in fact they owned much additional land along the street. (1902 marked its earliest mention in the press; 1923 was when it consumed Burbank’s 8th Street.) Walter Kenneth Dow never married, but a woman named Jennie Cornwell (1874-1960) lived with him for decades. The 1910 census listed her as the Dows’ cook, but the 1940 and 1950 censuses called her Walter’s “sister”. The true nature of their relationship remains a mystery.

The rancho was deeded in 1828 to the Rocha family, who, after California’s 1850 statehood, went broke in legal fees trying to prove ownership. Who was owed those fees? The Rochas’ lawyer, HenryHancock. And who wound up with their rancho as a result? You guessed it: Henry Hancock. This happened in 1860. Years after Henry’s 1883 death, his son George Allan Hancock discovered oil on the property – the tar, of course, gave him a clue – and bled it dry before developing part of it into pricy Hancock Park. As for La Brea Avenue, in its infancy it was called Plummer Street, after John C. Plummer (c. 1825-1909), an English sea captain who bought 160 acres from Hancock the elder in 1874. (West Hollywood’s Plummer Park sits on the ranch run by John’s son Eugene (1852-1943), a beloved local character; the Valley’sPlummer Streethonors a grandson.)

He ultimately received the rank of brigadier general. La Grange, who had studied law, came to California after the war and was elected district attorney of Alameda County. In 1869, he was appointed superintendent of the San Francisco Mint, which ended in accusations that employee malfeasance was happening under his nose.

Widney, Hugh L.Macneil, John K.Alexander, and George C.Hagar. That same year, Maclay established what would ultimately become the Claremont School of Theology.

Although the City didn’t make Main Street official until 1920, Elizabeth Street was all but forgotten by 1900.

While the etymology of “Sequit” is unclear, it’s accepted that Topanga, Malibu, and Simi were names of ancient Kizh (a.k.a. Tongva) and Chumash villages located in the area. Since these tribal peoples had no written language, English and Spanish speakers spelled Malibu’s name in all manner of ways: indeed, I found “Maligo” more often than “Malibu” in 19th century publications. In the 1970s, linguists decided that the Chumash actually pronounced it “Humaliwo” and that it means “place of the wild surf”. How they came to these conclusions is beyond me. Regardless, Rancho Topanga Malibu was granted in 1805 – while California was a Spanish colony – to soldier José Bartolomé Tapia. His widow Francisca sold the property to her granddaughter Merced and husband Leon Victor Prudhomme in 1848; Prudhomme flipped it to Matthew “DonMateo” Keller in 1857 (although several 1870s newspapers showed Tapia family members selling some of the rancho); and finally Keller’s son Henry sold it to Cambridge transplant FrederickRindgein 1892.

Howes (1838-1898), was being offered by a real estate auction firm called the Los Angeles Land Bureau, ironically run by San Franciscans but with one local representative: James BoonLankershim(1850-1931), a big mover and shaker whose father Isaac had brought the San Fernando Valley to life.

Lured by the Gold Rush, he went to San Francisco in 1850 and made his home and his fortune there. He got into railroads in 1865, then snapped up 143,000 acres all across California in the 1870s. This included his 1875 purchase of the 46,460 acre Rancho San Francisco here in the Santa Clarita Valley, where he set up a ranch. The following year, the town of Newhall was named in his honor by the Southern Pacific Railroad, of which he was a director. Newhall was married twice and had five sons.

Although Inglewood and Glendale were vying for the campus, there’s no record of this neighborhood doing same. At any rate, Oxy’s trustees decided upon Highland Park later in 1896, and the college found its forever home in Eagle Rock in 1912. So why is this street called Occidental Blvd.? Well, at the time its first segment was laid out (between present-dayBeverlyand Sixth), it was next to the city’s western boundary. “Occidental” means “western”, so there you have it.

Palmdale’s earliest residents were indeed Germans and Swiss, so I’m sure they knew it as “Palmenthal”. In fact the town was officially given that name in 1888 because a development in San Diego County had already registered “Palmdale” with the U.S. Post Office, but by 1890 the locals had reclaimed the English moniker.

There was already a little train depot here called Bay View, but the trio dubbed their townsite “The Palms” and planted palm trees across from the renamed depot to make their point. (Their ads also promised “no saloons”.) Palms was annexed by Los Angeles in 1915. Yet it wasn’t until 1953 when David I. Worsfold, secretary of the Palms Chamber of Commerce and Palms’s preeminent historian, suggested “Palms Boulevard” as a replacement for a messy string of connected roads (from east to west: Stilson Street in Palms itself; Ocean Park Avenue, which was often confused withOcean Park Boulevard; Alexandria Way; and most ofRialto Avenue).

He simply liked the definition ofparamountas “supreme” and “important”; althoughParamountPictures was certainly a popular movie studio in 1931, the company had no facilities in the area and was not involved in the decision. Now, what is this “Hynes-Clearwater”, you ask? Well, they were two separate towns that were combined to form the City of Paramount in 1946. Frank Zamboni (1901-1988), inventor of the Zamboni ice resurfacing machine, was instrumental in the city’s naming – the Zambonis had lived here for decades, and the Zamboni Company is still headquartered in Paramount.

(Gallagher also awarded $100 to a Mrs. Mary Gibson Whitlock for naming the tract itself: Morning Glory Terraces.) In a long-winded statement, McCroskey explained that the wordparamount“epitomize[d] the best” and alluded to the street’s high elevation.

Paramount Motors completed one building in early 1925, then went out of business; allegedly only three cars were ever built.

An active Mason and Knight Templar, Parcels also had a flair for government work: he was elected city tax collector in 1882 and served for three years.

Since those names mostly honored the wives of Pomona’s founders, it’s thought that Ellen Street was for Sarah Ellen Parcels (1834-1880), whose husband Horatio gave his name toParcels Street. But what little documentation there is suggests that Mrs. Parcels went by her first name – so why not Sarah Street? Adding to the mystery, there’s a rumor that an Ellen Parcels is buried with Horatio Parcels in an unmarked Los Angeles grave, and that she was born in 1879 and died in 1892. All I know for sure is that Sarah Ellen Thomas was born in Ohio, married Parcels in 1856, and had at least three sons with him – and that there was no park on Park Avenue in 1907.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/park-avenue-map.png

https://lastreetnames.com/street/pasadena-avenue/,Pasadena Avenue,Pasadena,"Back in 1874, the settlement that would become Pasadena had the working title of “IndianaColony” as its core founders hailed from Indianapolis. When the time came to name a post office and thus the town, those founders considered – then nixed – “New Grenada”, “Indianola”, “Muscat”, and “Kleikos”(!). Ranchero ManuelGarfias, former owner of RanchoSan Pascual, where the new town lay, called his home “la llave del rancho” – “key of the ranch” – which inspired the colonists. However, they found “llave” hard to spell and pronounce, so they sought instead a catchy native term for “key of the valley”. Enter Rev. George Nelson Smith (1807-1881), a Vermont-born missionary who had been based in Michigan since the 1830s and knew the Ojibwe/Chippewa people so well that he translated the Bible into their language. He submittedTá pe ká e gun–Pâ-sâ-de-náfor “Key of the Valley”. His other suggestions, for Crown, Peak, and Hill of the Valley, all ended in “Pâ-sâ-de-ná” as well. So the founders just went with that. Now, how did the good reverend, living way out in Northport, MI, come to name a California town? I believe colony president Dr. Thomas B. Elliott (1824-1881) wrote back home to Indianapolis journalist Eli Cromwell Tuttle (1842-1925) for help. Presumably he was friends with Tuttle and knew that Tuttle’s father-in-law, Rev. Smith, was versed in native languages. Smith’s letter with the “Pâ-sâ-de-ná” suggestions was addressed to “Son Tuttle”, so Tuttle was obviously involved. Some reports suggest that Dr. Elliott had gone to college with Smith – but with a 17 year gap between their ages, I wouldn’t count on that.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pasadena-avenue-map.png

His success encouraged his father, stepmother, and eight half-siblings to leave South Wales for L.A. in 1884. Four of those siblings never married and would live together for the rest of their lives, including Octavius and Mary, who surely inherited this parcel of land from Griffith. As for the four new streets on their tract, there’s no evidence that the Griffiths named them personally and no explanation for the monikers. I assume Entrance Drive is so called because it was the entrance to the tract off ofHyperion; little Radio Street, at the top of the hill, might have been envisioned as a spot for a radio tower (which to my knowledge never materialized); Claremont was possibly a nod to its “clear mountain” view.

Shorb founded the town of Ramona here in 1886, and although he technically named it for his daughter, he surely knew that Jackson’s book was attracting thousands of visitors to SoCal and that the “Ramona” name was hot. So when the U.S. Post Office was about to let a town near San Diego call itself Ramona, Shorb fought hard for the naming rights, claiming that Jackson herself had visited his family in the early 1880s and, enchanted by little Ramona Shorb, declared that “Ramona” would be the heroine of her new novel. Was it true? Who knows? Shorb won his battle, but it was a fleeting victory: this Ramona was rechristened Monterey Park in 1916, and the San Diego town retook the name. As for Ramona Shorb, in 1900 she married Colonel John A. Murtagh, an Army doctor, and relocated to San Francisco. Dr. Murtagh was notable for overseeing that city’s temporary hospitals in the aftermath of the Great 1906 Earthquake.

The Sanfords were a Kentucky farming family who moved to Missouri sometime between William’s and Rebecca’s births, then settled in L.A. by 1851. Many of the Sanford siblings came to tragic ends. Rebecca died in childbirth – of the eight children she had with Banning, only three survived infancy. William was one of twenty-six victims of the April 27th, 1863 explosion of Banning’s steamshipAda Hancock. Months later, William’s brother John was murdered by Wild West outlaw Charles Wilkins, who boasted of having killed nine men before he was lynched by a gang of L.A. vigilantes led by Banning himself. Cyrus Sanford Sr., who oversaw the family farm in Rancho La Ballona (see Del Rey’sSanford Street), allegedly committed suicide in 1886 due to financial ruin.

Cyrus was born on the family ranch and lived there until at least 1900. That’s when he married one Minnie Bannister and began working as a ranch hand around the county. It was not a happy union: Cyrus divorced Minnie in 1908, claiming that she stalked him at work, cheated on him, and bathed their children in gasoline(!). He got custody of their two sons; she their infant daughter.

(I found no Ana or Anita Cota in Luisa’s family tree.) The likelier theory is that the diminutive of “Santa Ana” was used to distinguish this rancho from the larger Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, where the city of Santa Ana now sits. In any event, Rancho Santa Anita was a 13,314 acre land grant deeded to ScotsmanHugo Reidin 1841, two years after he petitioned for it. Over the ensuing decades, the rancho went through a string of owners, including HenryDalton, circus producer Joseph A. Rowe, and finally Elias J. “Lucky”Baldwin, who bought the land from HarrisNewmarkin 1875, sold off chunks of it to NathanielCarterand WilliamMonroe, then subdivided the rest of it asArcadiain 1887.

(Their farm was at Taft Ave. and Prospect Ave., later renamedHollywood Blvd.) He soon became entrenched in the young town’s development, particularly in real estate. Although Taft himself retired to Nogales, AZ in 1913, his children – above all Alfred Z. Taft Jr. (1889-1941) – kept the family business thriving. Their crowning achievement: the Taft Building at Hollywood &Vine, completed in 1924. At twelve stories, it was L.A.’s first high-rise outside of downtown; many of its offices were rented out to movie folk (agents, publicists, etc.), which made its intersection the most famous in the world.

(Nearly two years earlier, there was an attempt to change Grasshopper Street to Union Street; Grasshopper ultimately becameFigueroa.) At any rate, Union started out between present-day 6th St. andJames M. Wood Blvd.(Back then they were called Ward St. and 9th St., respectively.) It was on the Fairmount tract, owned by an association – or union, if you will – of 26 investors.

Within this 5,000 acre city-within-a-city, Marks envisioned not only an 85 acre hillside campus – home to the brand-new UCLA, he hoped – but also a country club, hotel, amphitheaters, an “aircraft depot”, a military academy for boys, a finishing school for girls, a 20 acre civic center at today’s McCambridge Park, and hundreds of homes. University Avenue was conceived as a wide, park-lined concourse through the development. But long story short, even after rebranding the site Benmar Hills in 1923, Marks failed to impress the UC Regents, and UCLA moved from its original location (seeNormal Avenue) toWestwoodin 1929.

Vail eventually became an all-around capitalist, running a petroleum company in New Jersey, a tramway in Liverpool (while living in London), and the “Total Wreck” mine outside of Tucson. The family settled in L.A. by 1875 and Vail bought 20 acres southwest of downtown for his estate. He later sold the house and land to Charles Silent, who turned it intoChester Place. Vail and Silent were close friends and business partners and on November 4th, 1887, along with DanMcFarlandand others, they incorporated the Redondo Beach Co. and the Centinela-Inglewood Land Co., effectively founding bothRedondo BeachandInglewoodon the same day.

City planners made it clear that they looked to Valencia, Spain for inspiration – the mayor of that city was flown out for our Valencia’s dedication – but they may have also been thinking of the Valencia orange, once a major SoCal cash crop. The orange itself did not originate from Spain, but accounts differ as to how it came by the name. Some say California citrus pioneer WilliamWolfskillnamed it. Unlikely. A 1915 book by pomology expert Dr. John Eliot Coit claimed instead that Los Angeles lawyer/developer A.B.Chapmanimported the orange from English nurseryman Thomas Rivers in the 1870s and that a Spanish orchardist working for Chapman named it.

A year earlier, in fact, there was a petition to change the name of West Covina itself to “Valinda”, but Camille Alphonse Garnier (1915-1968), who developed the subdivision with his widowed mother Constance Blanche Garnier (1882-1973), was protective of the Valinda brand and wouldn’t allow it.

(Eugene Valjean led an interesting life, even teaming up with Wyatt Earp in the Potash Wars of the 1910s; his nephew Nelson was a biographer of John Steinbeck.) “Valjean” might have even been wordplay on Streeter’s part: “Val” for “Valley” and “Jean” for his infant daughter Marjorie Jean, born mere weeks before the tract opened.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/valjean-avenue-map.png

Silent movie actor Eddie Lyons and his wife Virginia were investors, and Butler’s new wife LaRue Wallace Butler reportedly hatched the streets’ names, which alluded to their bird’s-eye views of the city: Bluebird, Bobolink, Flicker, Kinglet, Mockingbird, Nightingale, Oriole, Robin, Swallow, Tanager, Thrasher, Thrush, and Warbler. (Osprey, Peacock, Vireo, and Waxwing were planned but never materialized.) Blue Jay Way – the very street immortalized in a Beatles song – joined the flock in 1960, as did Skylark Lane in 1964. More recently, the former Pinto Place was rechristened Hummingbird Place in 2017 to capitalize on the Bird Streets pedigree. As for the Beatles’ “Blue Jay Way”, George Harrison was renting a house on Blue Jay Way in the summer of 1967. One foggy night, trying to stay awake while waiting for Beatles publicist Derek Taylor to arrive, Harrison wrote the song on a Hammond organ in the corner.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/warbler-way-map.png

In January 1878, Wardlow and his girlfriend Martha Draper (1861-1936) wished to marry – but she was only 16. So they took a boat three miles from shore and were legally wedded in “international waters”. (They couldn’t do that now!) The Wardlows owned some 80 acres around Signal Hill and grew vegetables like celery before selling off most of their land in 1897 and relocating to Fountain Valley. (They ended their days in Santa Ana, but are buried back in Signal Hill.) As chance would have it, a completely unrelated Wardlow – David Settle Wardlow (1835-1904), a farmer, pastor, and Civil War veteran from North Carolina – was moving to Signal Hill with his family right around that time, after years inNorwalkandEl Monte. The earliest reference I found for Wardlow Road was January 1908, so although Bruce Wardlow’s descendants claim the street for him, it’s not impossible that David Wardlow is its true namesake.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wardlow-road-map.png

Born in Sacramento, “Lutie” Cole was the daughter of Senator Cornelius Cole, who founded the town of Colegrove and liked to name streets here after family members. (SeeCole Avenuefor more.) After a year-plus engagement, she married Lt. Waring in Colegrove in 1882 once he returned from the Bering Strait – he had been posted there to search for the crew of the USSJeannette, who were lost while exploring the Arctic. The couple briefly lived in St. Louis, where their only child Olive (1885-1944) was born, then settled in Washington, D.C. But the Arctic’s extreme conditions had wrecked Howard’s health and his final decade was a struggle, although he remained active in the Navy until his death. Lutie and Olive stayed on in D.C. until relocating to Los Angeles in 1909. Olive, who never married, wound up teaching at Hollywood High.

As California was then controlled by Mexico, Warner became a Mexican citizen in order to own some 44,000 acres in San Diego County –  then changed his name to Juan José Warner.

One more state was added in 1902, when Railroad Avenue was renamed Colorado Avenue, but then three were lost: Oregon became part ofSanta Monica Blvd.in 1912 and Nevada adoptedWilshire Blvd.‘s name in 1913. As for Utah Avenue, which had no Los Angeles boulevard to connect to, property owners successfully petitioned the City of Santa Monica to change it to Broadway in April 1924. Why?

Anyway, if you’re wondering why this presidential motorcade concludes with Jefferson, in fact more POTUS-inspired streets were intended: an 1871 “wishful thinking” map included Madison Street, Monroe Street, the awkwardly-named John Quincy Adams Street, and Jackson Street.

They had previously lived in Cedar Falls, Iowa – just a stone’s throw from Waterloo – and had come out to Los Angeles for the big real estate boom. (They were reportedly physicians before that.) Their father Solomon had settled here a few years earlier and opened the nearbyMarathontract. He most likely gave his sons his own land to subdivide: today’sCoronadoTerrace was called Hubbard Street back then.

Given its perplexing pronunciation, you can see why there aren’t more. For while a Spanish speaker would pronounce Ximeno “hee-MAY-no”, it’s a Long Beach tradition to say “ex-IMM-en-o”. Why such an unusual street name? Here’s my hypothesis: it’s a fact that the Alamitos Beach townsite was laid out in 1886 with twenty alphabetically-arranged avenues, starting withAlamitosas the “A” and ending withTerminoas the “T”. I believe someone designed Ximeno as the “X” in an eastward expansion of these avenues – it is four blocks east of Termino, after all – and for some reason the “U”, “V”, and “W” names never materialized. At any rate, some say this street’s inspiration is Jimena Díaz de Vivar (c. 1046 – c. 1116), wife of the great Spanish hero El Cid. In her era, “Jimena” would have indeed been spelled “Ximena” – so why notXimenaAvenue? A more plausible namesake is Manuel Jimeno Casarín (1815-1853), occasional acting governor of Alta California during Mexican rule.

In that same petition, they wanted Grasshopper Street renamed Union Street (Pearl Street was chosen instead; it’s now part ofFigueroa) and Bull Street to be called Castelar Street (it was, and remained so until 1960, when it finally became NorthHill). Wasp Street was likely named for the same buggy reason that Grasshopper Street was: insects were a big problem in the wild young pueblo. But why Yale? We may assume some property owner was a graduate of that hallowed university, but amongst the people associated with this neighborhood in the 1870s, none were Yalies. P.S.

No university was planned for this neighborhood – UCLA was still two decades away – so developers probably just thought that prestigious schools made for attractive street names. The original streets, from west to east, were Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Berkeley, Franklin, Cambridge, Vassar, Wellesley, and Amherst. Cambridge eventually got coopted byCentinelaand little Vassar, just one block long, became part ofCarmelina. If you’re wondering about the inspiration for Franklin Street, I wonder too. Is it tiny Franklin College in Franklin, IN? The then-new Franklin University in Columbus, OH? Or Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, PA? It’s a mystery why the tract’s owners chose Franklin over something more recognizable like Dartmouth or Cornell.

The etymology of the name itself – coined for Yosemite Valley in 1851 – is a matter of dispute: some claim it’s a corruption of the Miwok term for “grizzly bear”; others believe it was Miwok for “killers” and referred to a fierce native tribe, the Ahwahneechee, who lived in said valley.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yosemite-drive-map.png

Harry’s, in fact, was just down the hill from Zitto Lane. He later managed theSaugusbranch of Patio Pizza, a small local chain that disappeared after 1977.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/zitto-lane-map.png
https://lastreetnames.com/street/zombar-avenue/,Zombar Avenue,Van Nuys,"This street was given its monstrous moniker in 1927 on a tract that had only the Security Trust & Savings Bank listed as owner. Since “Zombar” isn’t a real name, I assume it’s wordplay. My best guess is that the bankers who set up this tract affectionately named the street after a fellow banker – namely John H. Ramboz (1879-1960) of Merchants National Bank and/or Sumpter F. Zombro (1864-1937) of Security-First National Bank. Both were prominent in financial circles, but I favor Ramboz because in 1927 he already had a namesake L.A. street (Ramboz Drive), so to avoid duplications the tract owners anagrammed “Ramboz” into “Zombar”. This is all just conjecture, mind you.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zombar-avenue-map.png
https://lastreetnames.com/street/zonal-avenue/,Zonal Avenue,Lincoln Heights,"This street’s etymology is hazy; my best guess is that “zonal” refers to the eastern boundary – the “end zone”, if you will – of the City of Los Angeles. (Maps show how the 36° angle of streets laid out in L.A.’s original four square leagues ends just east of here. For more on that weird angle, see1st Street.) It’s worth noting that Zonal Avenue, named in 1888, was originally laid out a little east of its current location and closer to city limits. It was a crescent-shaped road that ran fromSototoWabashin the old De Soto Heights tract, long since bisected by the 10 freeway. The lower half of that crescent became part ofEvergreen Avenueby 1921. Meanwhile, the portion of Zonal that now abuts USC Medical Center was originally known as Wood Avenue! It became part ofGriffin Avenuein 1897, then part of Zonal over a decade later. The reasons behind these changes are lost in the mists of time.",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/zonal-avenue-map.png
https://lastreetnames.com/street/zook-drive/,Zook Drive,Glendale,"Probably named for Omer Law “O.L.” Zook (1873-1942), a teacher-turned-lumber dealer-turned-real estate agent. Born in Illinois and raised in Iowa, Zook moved to Oklahoma and married Elsie Mae Woodmancy (1885-1965) in 1902. The couple relocated to Glendale in 1920 and had one daughter, Virginia Mae (1923-1992), who later married a fellow named Ed Wasil. Although the Zooks lived two miles away from Zook Drive, the street was named in 1937 while Zook was still active in real estate. He is thus a safe bet as its namesake. (Family footnote: O.L.’s brother A.J. Zook, a physician, came to Burbank in 1924.)",https://lastreetnames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/zook-drive-map.png
