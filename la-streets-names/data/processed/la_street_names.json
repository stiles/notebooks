        "description":"First things first. The numbering system of L.A.\u2019s streets was established by 1846. In 1883, addresses south of 1st Street \u2013 technically southwest, since DTLA\u2019s grid is laid out at a 36\u00b0 angle; more on that in a second \u2013 were given the postal designation \u201cSouth\u201d, while all addresses north of 1st were \u201cNorth\u201d. That\u2019s why we have, for example, 789 N.La Breaand 789 S. La Brea. Likewise, addresses east ofMain Streetwere designated \u201cEast\u201d and so on. Now about that 36\u00b0 angle, which you can see on a map: this reveals L.A.\u2019s Spanish roots. The Laws of the Indies, set forth in 1573 to develop Spanish colonies worldwide, decreed that streets be laid out at a 45\u00b0 angle so that all structures may receive equal sunlight throughout the day. The geography of young Los Angeles didn\u2019t quite allow for that, so early urban planners got as close as they could with 36\u00b0. Once L.A. expanded west of today\u2019sHoover Street, the city \u2013 now an American one \u2013 adopted Thomas Jefferson\u2019s rationalist north-south grid system.",

Cute story, not true. The cul-de-sacs were laid out in 1922 on the Brentwood Country Club Estates tract, owned by Richard P. Shea (1868-1932), whose wife was named Elizabeth. (They soon split and he married Jane McComas in 1924.) Shea simply borrowed \u201cHelena\u201d from nearby Helena Street, which originatedin 1907. That was on the Carlos Heights tract, set up by Chicago hotelier Tracy C. Drake (1864-1939), whose Blackstone and Drake hotels still operate in the Windy City. Since Drake named Carlos Heights for his son Carlos, it follows that his streets were tributes to other loved ones:Anita Avenuemay be for his wife Annie and Helena Street may be for his sister Helen Vernera Drake (1867-1960), a Chicago socialite. (I have no guesses for Carmelina Ave.) Coincidentally, Richard P. Shea had a daughter named Helen, so his 25 Helena Drives could be for her. Tragic postscript: On Christmas Eve 1932, two months after his wife Jane\u2019s death, a despondent Shea tied her ashes around his neck and drowned himself in the Pacific.",

Kinney soured on his later Ocean Park partners, so in February 1904 he reportedly staged a coin toss to divide their property between them. Kinney won the toss and unexpectedly chose the \u201cworthless\u201d marshland south of SM. A month later, he revealed his plans to transform it into a facsimile of Venice, Italy. The Venice of America \u2013 canals and all \u2013 opened on July 4th, 1905. It was a hit with the day trippers and Kinney got to die before seeing his oceanside fantasyland deteriorate.

Tragedy struck in December 1922 when her mother Laura (n\u00e9e Gonzalez) passed away suddenly, but Agnes focused on her studies and her music \u2013 she was a gifted pianist \u2013 and in 1925 enrolled at Dominican College in San Rafael.

Later that year, and shortly after the stock market crash that would wipe out her own family\u2019s net worth, Agnes Temple married Luis Paul Fatj\u00f3 (1904-1946), a wealthy Spanish American from Santa Clara, CA. They had homes in San Francisco and Atherton and raised two children.

Agoure died after accidentally drinking formaldehyde and the ranch was inherited by his son Lester Pierre Agoure (1892-1953). With his wife Frances Lea Agoure (1891-1972), Lester petitioned the City of L.A. to annex this land in 1923 so they could access the City\u2019s water supply. In 1927, during the hard-drinking Agoures\u2019 lengthy but unsuccessful divorce attempt, \u201cAgoura\u201d was chosen for a post office here.

Born near Wilmington, Delaware, Banning set sail for San Francisco in 1851. According to lore, the ship he was on was seized by debt collectors, which left Banning in the sleepy fishing village ofSan Pedro,where he got a job as a clerk. Twenty miles away, the young city of Los Angeles was struggling to grow without a port, so Banning saw an opportunity: partnering with David W. Alexander, he launched a service wagoning goods from the coast into town. As business boomed, Banning decided to build L.A. its own port. He led a team of investors in buying harbor land from theDom\u00ednguezfamily and in 1863 he named the portWilmington, after his hometown, while the long process of dredging the harbor and constructing a breakwater continued. Along with championing SoCal\u2019s first railroad (between Wilmington and L.A., naturally) and serving on the CA State Senate, Banning also ran a stagecoach service between L.A. and Yuma, AZ; a stop along the route later became the city of Banning in Riverside County. Banning\u2019s first wife Rebecca (n\u00e9eSanford) gave him three surviving sons before she died in childbirth in 1868. The sons would buy Catalina Island in 1892. Second wife Mary (n\u00e9e Hollister; her uncle founded Hollister, CA) bore Banning two daughters \u2013 one of whom, Lucy, deserves her own book: she would marry four times and steal at least one husband (seeDolores Road). Phineas Banning suffered internal injuries after being struck by a wagon in San Francisco in 1883. He perished in that city two years later.",

Kinney deeded them to the City of Venice (when it was still its own municipality) in 1912, basically to make taxpayers pay for their upkeep. After he died in 1920, there began a demand to convert his canals into streets. Venice set the plans in motion in March 1925 and coined new street names that June: Grand and Rialto canals, which took their names from Italy\u2019s Venice, were to be renamed Grand Boulevard and Rialto Avenue. Venus, Aldebaran, and Altair canals \u2013 named after heavenly bodies \u2013 would now beSan Juan Avenue, Market Street, and Altair Place, respectively. Lion Canal would become an extension ofWindward Avenue, Cabrillo Canal would be Cabrillo Avenue, and Coral Canal would be Second Avenue (now part of Santa Monica\u2019sMain Street). It took four more years, the City of L.A. annexing Venice, and numerous legal snags, but the canals were finally filled in and paved by January 29th, 1930.",

At any rate, the first time Calabasas was mentioned in print was in January 1874 \u2013 and in classic L.A. style, it involved a homicide. A fellow named Anisetto Roman was shot in \u201cCalabasas Ca\u00f1on\u201d by M.J. Banks, a rancher known for running afoul of the law.

He came to Los Angeles in December 1843; a year later, he bought portions of RanchoAzusaand RanchoSan Jos\u00e9from LuisArenas. The former he dubbed Rancho Azusa de Dalton, to differentiate it from Rancho Azusa deDuarte. Eventually Dalton would grow crops and raise cattle on four big ranchos spread out over 45,000 acres. In 1847, he married 15-year-old Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Zamorano (1832-1914), with whom he would have eleven children. Unfortunately, like so many people who snapped up California land during Mexican rule, Dalton had a disastrous time proving ownership after CA\u2019s 1850 statehood and spent decades battling both squatters and bureaucrats. (His frustration is immortalized in the 1880 U.S. Census, in which his profession is listed as \u201cFighting for his rights\u201d.) Dalton ultimately lost his legal disputes, his fortune, and nearly all of his land. Rancho Azusa de Dalton wound up in the hands of Jonathan SayreSlauson, who established the town of Azusa in 1887.

De Celis would also own a hotel and a vineyard in DTLA, but he moved back to Spain c. 1854 and died in Bilbao. His widow Josefa and sons Eulogio Fidencio, Pastor, and Jos\u00e9 Miguel then returned to Los Angeles to oversee the family\u2019s holdings. (Eulogio F. also served on City Council and edited L.A.\u2019s Spanish language newspaperLa Cr\u00f3nicawith Pastor.) They sold the northern half of the Valley to CharlesMaclayin 1874; P\u00edo Pico eventually acquired his brother\u2019s southern half, then sold it to IsaacLankershimin 1869. The de Celis name was remembered by later Valley developers: this street was christened in 1911.",

Anyway, the whole shebang was changed to Edinburgh in 1925. As for the inspiration behind the street name, I\u2019ve got nothing. Edinburgh\u2019s original tract was owned by a trust company run by banker Leo S. Chandler, who had no ties to Scotland.

Indeed, most of what is known about Charles Fickett comes from old newspaper racing columns; details of his personal life are hazier. All that\u2019s clear is that in 1889 he married Agnes Davidson, a young widow with a toddler named Hal. The 1900 census showed the three of them living in El Monte, with Fickett\u2019s occupation listed as \u201cfarmer\u201d.",

(Proper Mexican Spanish would bechapulines, butchapulesis an allowed variant.) Legend holds that if these crop-devouring insects made it past this road and into the vineyards, the year\u2019s grape harvest would be doomed. Anyway, by 1867, a separate road called Figueroa Street had popped up a few blocks west, honoring General Jos\u00e9 Figueroa (1792-1835), who served as governor of Alta California at the end of his short life. During his two-year administration, Figueroa united the government, secularized the missions, and began offering land grants to Mexican soldiers: all major moments in California history. Back to the streets: Grasshopper was renamed Pearl Street in 1874; twenty-three years later, in 1897, Pearl became Figueroa while the old Figueroa becameBoylston. Then, grasshopper-like, this new Figueroa would devour every street in its path as it expanded. Much later, theArroyo Seco Parkwaytook a bite out of Figueroa itself.",

It\u2019s not clear if Garthwaite returned the favor by investing in Leimert Park, but he did co-own Leimert\u2019sCity Terracetract. Heartbroken by the death of his son John in 1946, W.W. Garthwaite passed six weeks later at 94.",

First, some background: Henry Hancock (1822-1883) was a Harvard-educated lawyer and surveyor who came to L.A. in 1850 and amassed great power. He married Ida Haraszthy (1843-1913), the daughter of Hungarian aristocrats, in 1863. By that point, Henry had finagled a deal that gave him and his siblings ownership of RanchoLa Brea, but he left his heirs in debt when he died. Ida then proved herself a clever steward of the Hancocks\u2019 vast holdings. Assisted by her son George Allan Hancock (1875-1965), she turned the family fortunes around, especially once oil was discovered on their property. She married Judge ErskineRossin 1909; G. Allan subdivided the family\u2019s remaining land as posh Hancock Park in 1919. Back here in WeHo, in 1906, Ida donated a church organ to the St. Victor Catholic Church around the corner onHolloway Drive\u2013 and of course this was old Rancho La Brea land \u2013 so it\u2019s easy to argue that Hancock Ave. honors her.

There is one funny story attributed to him: While visiting a friend at thePicoHouse hotel, Johnston reportedly whipped out a pistol and shot a cockroach off the cuff of his friend\u2019s trousers.",

Alvaro Alma Pratt was a civil engineer who hailed from a prominent Utah family; Anna Laura Tharsing was born in Minnesota to Danish immigrants. After going bankrupt on a failed summer resort in Salt Lake City, Alvaro moved to L.A. by 1910 and was living in Laurel Canyon by 1912. He and Laura married in 1914. The couple had two children: Dick (1920-1998) and Lark (1923-2019), hence the names of two of these cul-de-sacs \u2013 although it is curious that Lark Lane was named before Lark Pratt was. As for Padre and Happy? Perhaps the former referred to Papa Alvaro and the latter came from \u201chappy as a lark\u201d. Anyway, the Pratts moved to WeHo after subdividing their property here. Alvaro then became one of the main visionaries behindMulholland Drive; ironically or not, he perished when his car plunged off another steep road in the Santa Susana Pass. Laura and the kids relocated to Santa Fe in 1941. Dick served as a translator during WWII, aided in Japan\u2019s postwar reconstruction, and worked for Chrysler and Ford in Detroit. Lark married one William Anthony in 1951 and spent her final years in Austin.",

The year was 1886, and they were visiting Italia\u2019s father Edwin R. Richmond (1818-1889), a shopkeeper who had already been here for four years \u2013 but as Edwin\u2019s second wife Harriet died that very November, he may have asked Italia to tend to her ailing stepmother. Regardless, the visit turned into a permanent residency, so Italia\u2019s husband, pharmacist Benjamin Franklin Cook (1837-1904), joined them here in 1887. Their eldest daughter Mary was then in college and didn\u2019t make it to Covina until around 1909, after her own husband died. Italia Richmond was born in upstate New York; she married B.F. Cook in 1866 and they lived in Milwaukee before their Iowa sojourn. Italia Street was named in 1901 on the Richmond tract, owned by the Cooks on land that Italia had inherited from her father. (There was some kerfuffle over his estate, as Edwin had married his third wife Amanda mere months before his death.) Perhaps Italia Cook\u2019s greatest contribution to Covina was cofounding the historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church and serving as its organist.",

Around that time, the rest of the Johnstons had migrated to L.A. to live with Griffin; Hancock grew up to subdivide East L.A. with his uncle, raise horses, have five kids with his wife Mary (daughter of BenjaminEaton), and suffer from arthritis. There is one funny story attributed to him: While visiting a friend at thePicoHouse hotel, Johnston reportedly whipped out a pistol and shot a cockroach off the cuff of his friend\u2019s trousers.",

He, his wife Netta, and their three kids returned to Chattanooga while his brother John Bunyan Allin remained in Pasadena.

Taft (1825-1918). The story goes that Taft went to Whittier in 1898, bought ten cuttings of a fig tree called a Dottato, then planted them at his Sawtelle nursery. One cutting grew into a new genetic variant with an especially sweet fig that Taft dubbed the Kadota. What\u2019s behind the name? A 1919 article surmised that it was just a corruption of \u201cDottato\u201d, sometimes spelled \u201cDotato\u201d: Taft took the \u201cdota\u201d and put a \u201cKa\u201d in front of it, for reasons known only to him. Kadota is also a Japanese surname, and there\u2019s a long tradition of Japanese nurserymen in Sawtelle, so it\u2019s not impossible that Taft named the fruit after an employee. At any rate, theSylmarPacking Corporation, formerly the L.A. Olive Growers Association, planted 30 acres of Kadota figs here in 1922. The following year, Hollywood\u2019sTaftfamily \u2013 no relation to Stephen Taft \u2013 named this street on their Sylmar Acres tract, vowing to plant even more Kadotas.",

They owned a ranch where these two streets originated, and while Peter was a German immigrant, Mathilda did indeed come from BC: the couple married there in 1883 and their only child Henry (1884-1967) was born there as well \u2013 shortly before the Haacks fled to California to evade Peter\u2019s unpaid debts. They ran a boarding house in DTLA for several years while Peter made money in the horse trade \u2013 then made much more in real estate. At the time of his 1915 death, with properties all over Los Angeles and 6,000 acres in Tulare County, he was reportedly worth $1.25 million. Henry Haack went on to manage his parents\u2019 interests and also partnered with Sherrill Osborne (seeOsborne Street) in a realty firm. He married thrice: first to Marie Petit, cousin ofPetit Avenue\u2018s namesake; then to singer Amber Fay, who bore him a daughter (also named Amber) but left him for a fellow warbler; and finally to Mabel Gardner.",

The Dows moved to North Glendale in 1896 and lived on a 10 acre citrus grove for fourteen years. (They weren\u2019t just humble farmers: when Albert died, his obituary called him \u201cone of the wealthiest ranchers and residents of this valley\u201d.) The grove was at the corner of Central Avenue and an unnamed dirt lane. As the story goes, a county supervisor up for reelection visited the Dows in 1900 and asked if there was anything he could do for them. Walter jokingly requested that the dirt lane be called \u201cKenneth Road\u201d, after his middle name. One week later, he found a brand new street sign reading exactly that. I don\u2019t know if the tale is true, but the Dows definitely lived on Kenneth Road; in fact they owned much additional land along the street. (1902 marked its earliest mention in the press; 1923 was when it consumed Burbank\u2019s 8th Street.) Walter Kenneth Dow never married, but a woman named Jennie Cornwell (1874-1960) lived with him for decades. The 1910 census listed her as the Dows\u2019 cook, but the 1940 and 1950 censuses called her Walter\u2019s \u201csister\u201d. The true nature of their relationship remains a mystery.

Years after Henry\u2019s 1883 death, his son George Allan Hancock discovered oil on the property \u2013 the tar, of course, gave him a clue \u2013 and bled it dry before developing part of it into pricy Hancock Park.

A flair for fundraising led Maclay into politics and he served on the California state legislature from 1861 until 1872. Two years later, he came to the San Fernando Valley and purchased 56,000 acres from the heirs of Eulogiode Celis. Borrowing money from LelandStanfordto seal the deal, Maclay recouped it by selling some of the land to farmers George and BenjaminPorter. At the core of his remaining acreage was his own city: San Fernando. In 1885, Maclay sold 20,000 acres around it to a syndicate that included Judge Robert M. Widney, Hugh L.Macneil, John K.Alexander, and George C.Hagar. That same year, Maclay established what would ultimately become the Claremont School of Theology.

With over 7,000 acres of sugar cane in Maui and multiple mills in Kauai, it was once the islands\u2019 biggest sugar producer. Wilhelmina Makee married Zephaniah Swift Spalding in 1871; he was the son of an Ohio congressman (the original Rufus Paine Spalding) and had been sent to Hawaii as U.S. Consul and \u201cconfidential agent\u201d. He took over Makee Sugar after James Makee\u2019s death. As for our Rufus Spalding, he came to L.A. in early 1905 and almost immediately bought and subdivided this tract. He married his second wife Elsa in 1909 and had one child with her: Rufus Jr. After divorcing Elsa in 1926 \u2013 she ran off to Paris with a French journalist \u2013 he lived with his brother James in South Pasadena.",

While the etymology of \u201cSequit\u201d is unclear, it\u2019s accepted that Topanga, Malibu, and Simi were names of ancient Kizh (a.k.a. Tongva) and Chumash villages located in the area. Since these tribal peoples had no written language, English and Spanish speakers spelled Malibu\u2019s name in all manner of ways: indeed, I found \u201cMaligo\u201d more often than \u201cMalibu\u201d in 19th century publications. In the 1970s, linguists decided that the Chumash actually pronounced it \u201cHumaliwo\u201d and that it means \u201cplace of the wild surf\u201d. How they came to these conclusions is beyond me. Regardless, Rancho Topanga Malibu was granted in 1805 \u2013 while California was a Spanish colony \u2013 to soldier Jos\u00e9 Bartolom\u00e9 Tapia. His widow Francisca sold the property to her granddaughter Merced and husband Leon Victor Prudhomme in 1848; Prudhomme flipped it to Matthew \u201cDonMateo\u201d Keller in 1857 (although several 1870s newspapers showed Tapia family members selling some of the rancho); and finally Keller\u2019s son Henry sold it to Cambridge transplant FrederickRindgein 1892.

The following year, the town of Newhall was named in his honor by the Southern Pacific Railroad, of which he was a director. Newhall was married twice and had five sons. In 1987, the towns of Newhall and Saugus were incorporated, along withValenciaand Canyon Country, into the City of Santa Clarita. The Newhall Land and Farming Company, run by H.M. Newhall\u2019s heirs, remains a major force in Santa Clarita.",

Born in Minnesota and raised in Santa Paula, CA, Orcutt made his name \u2013 and his fortune \u2013 as a petroleum geologist at Unocal\/Union Oil. Fossil enthusiasts can thank him for being the first to realize, in 1901, that the bones found in theLa BreaTar Pits were invaluable Ice Age relics. (The Pleistocene coyote was namedcanis orcuttiin his honor.) Unocal can thank Orcutt for discovering and mapping its oil fields: the city of Orcutt, north of Santa Barbara, was originally a Unocal company town. William and Mary Orcutt (1873-1972) themselves owned a ranch in the west San Fernando Valley \u2013 it\u2019s now a public park \u2013 where Mary led the charge in changing the name ofOwensmouthtoCanogaPark.",

It was renamed in 1929, leaving Pacoima Court behind as a memento. The name \u201cPacoima\u201d comes from the indigenous people of this region, but there are two theories about its origins. Many claim it was a Kizh (a.k.a Tongva) term meaning \u201crushing waters\u201d and referred to a creek (the Pacoima Wash) and canyon in the hills northeast of the Valley. The other theory, supported by the Pacoima Historical Society, is that it was the name of a village settled by the Tataviam people and meant \u201cthe entrance\u201d. The earliest printed mention I found was in 1874: it referred to the creek and it was spelled \u201cPacoyma\u201d. At any rate, the town of Pacoima was founded in 1887 by Jewett Allin \u2013Jouett Streetis misnamed for him \u2013 who had acquired the land from CharlesMaclayand partners.",

After going bankrupt on a failed summer resort in Salt Lake City, Alvaro moved to L.A. by 1910 and was living in Laurel Canyon by 1912. He and Laura married in 1914. The couple had two children: Dick (1920-1998) and Lark (1923-2019), hence the names of two of these cul-de-sacs \u2013 although it is curious that Lark Lane was named before Lark Pratt was. As for Padre and Happy? Perhaps the former referred to Papa Alvaro and the latter came from \u201chappy as a lark\u201d. Anyway, the Pratts moved to WeHo after subdividing their property here. Alvaro then became one of the main visionaries behindMulholland Drive; ironically or not, he perished when his car plunged off another steep road in the Santa Susana Pass. Laura and the kids relocated to Santa Fe in 1941. Dick served as a translator during WWII, aided in Japan\u2019s postwar reconstruction, and worked for Chrysler and Ford in Detroit.

When the time came to name a post office and thus the town, those founders considered \u2013 then nixed \u2013 \u201cNew Grenada\u201d, \u201cIndianola\u201d, \u201cMuscat\u201d, and \u201cKleikos\u201d(!). Ranchero ManuelGarfias, former owner of RanchoSan Pascual, where the new town lay, called his home \u201cla llave del rancho\u201d \u2013 \u201ckey of the ranch\u201d \u2013 which inspired the colonists. However, they found \u201cllave\u201d hard to spell and pronounce, so they sought instead a catchy native term for \u201ckey of the valley\u201d. Enter Rev. George Nelson Smith (1807-1881), a Vermont-born missionary who had been based in Michigan since the 1830s and knew the Ojibwe\/Chippewa people so well that he translated the Bible into their language. He submittedT\u00e1 pe k\u00e1 e gun\u2013P\u00e2-s\u00e2-de-n\u00e1for \u201cKey of the Valley\u201d. His other suggestions, for Crown, Peak, and Hill of the Valley, all ended in \u201cP\u00e2-s\u00e2-de-n\u00e1\u201d as well. So the founders just went with that. Now, how did the good reverend, living way out in Northport, MI, come to name a California town? I believe colony president Dr. Thomas B. Elliott (1824-1881) wrote back home to Indianapolis journalist Eli Cromwell Tuttle (1842-1925) for help. Presumably he was friends with Tuttle and knew that Tuttle\u2019s father-in-law, Rev. Smith, was versed in native languages. Smith\u2019s letter with the \u201cP\u00e2-s\u00e2-de-n\u00e1\u201d suggestions was addressed to \u201cSon Tuttle\u201d, so Tuttle was obviously involved. Some reports suggest that Dr. Elliott had gone to college with Smith \u2013 but with a 17 year gap between their ages, I wouldn\u2019t count on that.",

He married Florence Rivers Stowell \u2013 the ex-wife of an old National Bank colleague \u2013 the following year.

Any relation to Griffith Jenkins Griffith (1850-1919), donor ofGriffith Park? Indeed \u2013 they were his half-siblings.

Four of those siblings never married and would live together for the rest of their lives, including Octavius and Mary, who surely inherited this parcel of land from Griffith. As for the four new streets on their tract, there\u2019s no evidence that the Griffiths named them personally and no explanation for the monikers. I assume Entrance Drive is so called because it was the entrance to the tract off ofHyperion; little Radio Street, at the top of the hill, might have been envisioned as a spot for a radio tower (which to my knowledge never materialized); Claremont was possibly a nod to its \u201cclear mountain\u201d view.

So when the U.S. Post Office was about to let a town near San Diego call itself Ramona, Shorb fought hard for the naming rights, claiming that Jackson herself had visited his family in the early 1880s and, enchanted by little Ramona Shorb, declared that \u201cRamona\u201d would be the heroine of her new novel. Was it true? Who knows? Shorb won his battle, but it was a fleeting victory: this Ramona was rechristened Monterey Park in 1916, and the San Diego town retook the name. As for Ramona Shorb, in 1900 she married Colonel John A. Murtagh, an Army doctor, and relocated to San Francisco. Dr. Murtagh was notable for overseeing that city\u2019s temporary hospitals in the aftermath of the Great 1906 Earthquake.

Some have comparedRamonatoUncle Tom\u2019s Cabinin its effect of awakening white readers to the plight of a disenfranchised people, yet Jackson\u2019s evocative descriptions of the SoCal landscape would only attract more white settlers to the state. Selling hundreds of thousands of copies and receiving five big-screen adaptations, the novel was such a blockbuster that seemingly every town in California had to have a street named Ramona. In fact Interstate 10 through the San Gabriel Valley was previously known as the Ramona Freeway.",

Kinney deeded them to the City of Venice (when it was still its own municipality) in 1912, basically to make taxpayers pay for their upkeep. After he died in 1920, there began a demand to convert his canals into streets. Venice set the plans in motion in March 1925 and coined new street names that June: Grand and Rialto canals, which took their names from Italy\u2019s Venice, were to be renamed Grand Boulevard and Rialto Avenue.

Around twelve years later, he named Rebecca Street in her honor, but you know it now asBroad Avenue. Thus Sanford Avenue isn\u2019t really named for Rebecca but for her brother William T.B. Sanford (c. 1814-1863), a partner of Banning\u2019s and an early Los Angeles councilman, postmaster, and police chief. The Sanfords were a Kentucky farming family who moved to Missouri sometime between William\u2019s and Rebecca\u2019s births, then settled in L.A. by 1851. Many of the Sanford siblings came to tragic ends. Rebecca died in childbirth \u2013 of the eight children she had with Banning, only three survived infancy. William was one of twenty-six victims of the April 27th, 1863 explosion of Banning\u2019s steamshipAda Hancock. Months later, William\u2019s brother John was murdered by Wild West outlaw Charles Wilkins, who boasted of having killed nine men before he was lynched by a gang of L.A. vigilantes led by Banning himself. Cyrus Sanford Sr., who oversaw the family farm in Rancho La Ballona (see Del Rey\u2019sSanford Street), allegedly committed suicide in 1886 due to financial ruin. Only sister Marilda lived to a ripe old age; it\u2019s unclear what happened to their other sister Amanda.",

Cyrus was born on the family ranch and lived there until at least 1900. That\u2019s when he married one Minnie Bannister and began working as a ranch hand around the county. It was not a happy union: Cyrus divorced Minnie in 1908, claiming that she stalked him at work, cheated on him, and bathed their children in gasoline(!). He got custody of their two sons; she their infant daughter. In 1927, during a lawsuit with McDonald and the Erems, Cyrus Sanford falsely claimed insanity in order to void their 1924 agreement for this land. The judge didn\u2019t buy it.",

(I found no Ana or Anita Cota in Luisa\u2019s family tree.) The likelier theory is that the diminutive of \u201cSanta Ana\u201d was used to distinguish this rancho from the larger Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, where the city of Santa Ana now sits. In any event, Rancho Santa Anita was a 13,314 acre land grant deeded to ScotsmanHugo Reidin 1841, two years after he petitioned for it. Over the ensuing decades, the rancho went through a string of owners, including HenryDalton, circus producer Joseph A. Rowe, and finally Elias J. \u201cLucky\u201dBaldwin, who bought the land from HarrisNewmarkin 1875, sold off chunks of it to NathanielCarterand WilliamMonroe, then subdivided the rest of it asArcadiain 1887.

One of eleven kids, Walter Temple was born into wealth\u2026 which vanished when his dad\u2019s bank collapsed in 1876. He grew up on what remained of the family\u2019s property at Ranchola Merced, married Laura Gonzalez (1871-1922) in 1903, and had five children with her, four surviving. Temple bought back some of the land his father had lost to \u201cLucky\u201dBaldwinand that\u2019s when good fortune struck: oil was discovered there in 1914 and the family was rich again. With some of this largesse, Temple and his partners GeorgeWoodruff, MiltonKauffman, and SylvesterDupuylaid out a new town in 1923. Simply called \u201cTemple\u201d, it was rebranded Temple City in 1928. Along with the partners\u2019 eponymous streets \u2013 Temple City Blvd. was originally Temple Avenue \u2013Agnes Avenuehonors Temple\u2019s daughter. Unfortunately, just like his father, financial hardship wracked Temple\u2019s final years: he barely had a chance to enjoy his mansion \u201cLa Casa Nueva\u201d before leasing it out. It still stands onDon Julian Road, named for Grandpa William.",

Blavatsky (1831-1891), a Russian expat inspired by Eastern religions and mysticism. After her death, the society was taken over by Englishwoman Annie Besant (1847-1933) and was brought to Hollywood in 1912 by Albert Powell Warrington, who ran its North American branch. He and his fellow disciples bought 10 acres of these hills and established the utopian \u201cKrotona Institute\u201d here. Temple Hill and Vasanta were both named in 1914 when Theosophist Henry Hotchener bought 5 additional acres for the colony. Temple Hill refers to the colony\u2019s \u201cTemple of the Rosy Cross\u201d, now an apartment building; Vasanta is Sanskrit for \u201cspring\u201d but is also a play on \u201cBesant\u201d. A.P.

He was a blacksmith\u2019s son whose financial genius made him an editor at theChicago Tribune, then assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury, then head of the National City Bank of New York \u2013 today\u2019s Citibank. After their marriage, Narcissa became a noted suffragist, social progressive, and friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. She and Frank founded the country\u2019s first Montessori school in 1913, shortly before Frank led a team of investors to purchase around 16,000 acres of the Palos Verdes peninsula from JothamBixby\u2018s son George in 1913. Their son\u00a0Kelvin Cox Vanderlip (1912-1956) grew up to preside over\u00a0the Palos Verdes Corporation, which developed Rolling Hills andPortuguese Bend. He named Narcissa Drive in 1948; Vanderlip Drive was christened a few years later. Narcissa Cox Vanderlip kept her primary residence in New York but donated 3.5 acres of land for PV\u2019s landmark Wayfarers Chapel, designed by Lloyd Wright and dedicated in 1951.

In order to prevent duplication with existing L.A. streets, some of these species will be unfamiliar to the casual seafood eater. In alphabetical order, they are: Abalone Ave., Anabas Ave., Anchovy Ave., Bowfin Ave., Graysby Ave., Gunnell Ave., Gurnard Ave., Mantis Ave. (presumably for the mantis shrimp), Moray Ave., Mulldae Ave. (a misspelling of mullidae, or red mullet), Perch St., Robalo Ave., Shad Pl., Spearing Ave., Stargazer Ave., and Warmouth St.",

        "description":"It\u2019s one of the few biblical street names in Los Angeles, but no one can quite agree on what it means. Zelzah was in fact Northridge\u2019s original moniker, from 1910 to 1929, when the town was mostly a rail depot. It was coined by EmilyVoseWright (1855-1917), wife of Francis Marion \u201cBud\u201d Wright (1841-1937), who sold the 1,100 acreHubbard& Wright ranch in 1909 for this development. A 1903L.A. Timesarticle referred to the Wrights\u2019 property \u2013 either this ranch or their home in the city of San Fernando \u2013 as \u201cZelzah\u201d, so Emily had used the name for a while. Yetzelzahappears only once in the Old Testament: a passage in the First Book of Samuel mentions meeting \u201ctwo men by Rachel\u2019s tomb at zelzah\u201d. It\u2019s been variously interpreted as a suburb of Jerusalem (possibly the town of Beit Jala), as an oasis (\u201cshade from the heat\u201d), and as the hour of high noon. Emily Wright was allegedly working off the \u201coasis\u201d definition.",

Vincent\u2019s movie career never amounted to much, so he turned to real estate and was selling houses by 1959. Four years later, he and partner Al Hess started laying out the streets of the 300 acre Mount Olympus tract \u2013 streets they named after mythical Greek figures: Apollo, Electra, Hercules, Oceanus, etc. (The land itself, which had heretofore miraculously escaped development, was owned by the sinister-sounding Financial Federation Inc., run by Edward L.

Parents Natale (c. 1846-1910) and Concetta (c. 1852-1918) and sons Victor (1884-1975) and John (1887-1942) set up a vineyard here in 1907 on what was appropriately named the \u201cItalian Tract\u201d; it would be one of the last vineyards in this area. After Natale\u2019s death, Concetta married an Englishman named William Colan in 1912, but it went south a year later when it was discovered that Colan hadn\u2019t divorced his first wife. Victor and John eventually moved up to Tujunga to subdivide the vineyard land into housing. Zitto Lane was named in 1926. The next generation of Zittos \u2013 first cousins Harry (1907-1989) and Nat (1907-1981), born just a week apart \u2013 each ran his own service station on Foothill Boulevard. Harry\u2019s, in fact, was just down the hill from Zitto Lane. He later managed theSaugusbranch of Patio Pizza, a small local chain that disappeared after 1977.",

Since \u201cZombar\u201d isn\u2019t a real name, I assume it\u2019s wordplay. My best guess is that the bankers who set up this tract affectionately named the street after a fellow banker \u2013 namely John H.\u00a0Ramboz (1879-1960)\u00a0of Merchants National Bank and\/or Sumpter F. Zombro (1864-1937) of Security-First National Bank. Both were prominent in financial circles, but I favor Ramboz because in 1927 he already had a namesake L.A. street (Ramboz Drive), so to avoid duplications the tract owners anagrammed \u201cRamboz\u201d into \u201cZombar\u201d. This is all just conjecture, mind you.",

(Maps show how the 36\u00b0 angle of streets laid out in L.A.\u2019s original four square leagues ends just east of here. For more on that weird angle, see1st Street.) It\u2019s worth noting that Zonal Avenue, named in 1888, was originally laid out a little east of its current location and closer to city limits. It was a crescent-shaped road that ran fromSototoWabashin the old De Soto Heights tract, long since bisected by the 10 freeway. The lower half of that crescent became part ofEvergreen Avenueby 1921. Meanwhile, the portion of Zonal that now abuts USC Medical Center was originally known as Wood Avenue! It became part ofGriffin Avenuein 1897, then part of Zonal over a decade later. The reasons behind these changes are lost in the mists of time.",

The couple relocated to Glendale in 1920 and had one daughter, Virginia Mae (1923-1992), who later married a fellow named Ed Wasil. Although the Zooks lived two miles away from Zook Drive, the street was named in 1937 while Zook was still active in real estate. He is thus a safe bet as its namesake.
