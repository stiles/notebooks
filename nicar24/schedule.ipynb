Alongside that, there's a large and growing open-source sports analytics community that data journalists should be a part of. In this hands-on class, speakers will take you through examples of ways to use traditional data journalism tools like R and the Tidyverse to bring in up-to-the-moment sports data and do sophisticated analysis that you can immediately visualize to add context to seasons, leagues and sports.\\n\\nLaptops will be provided.   \n",

In this talk, I'll introduce you to httr2 and the basics of HTTP, so you can learn what powers so much of the modern internet, and how you can work with it from R.\\n\\nhttr2 is the successor to httr and has been under development for around two years. Compared to httr, httr2 has an explicit request object which leads to a more familiar interface where you can iteratively build up complex requests with the pipe. There's no need to stop using httr, as we'll continue to maintain it for many years to come, but for new projects, I'd highly recommend giving httr2 a shot.   \n",

This has changed recently through groundbreaking reporting that center the information needs of affected communities, including Rappler's coverage of trafficking of domestic workers, The New Arab's coverage of the fate of Syrian doctors and Lighthouse Report's coverage of the victims of brain waste in Europe. Each story collects data on otherwise invisible communities to map the extent of exploitation, identify barriers to implementing policy solutions and identifying ways communities themselves can take action to protect their own rights.   \n",

Different data sources (including from the government, advocacy organizations, and news outlets) use slightly different definitions of the term, and these discrepancies can be confusing for readers and make analysis of the phenomenon more complicated. This panel conversation among editors from publications that frequently cover mass shootings will consider how we think about the term, the available data on mass shootings, and data on gun violence more broadly.   \n",

They also often require customization to meet the needs of the day's story accurately and cleanly. These two requirements are often at odds with one another. Graphics libraries that let you make charts quickly are often not customizable. The most customizable graphics framework, D3, often requires a great deal of prep and code to even make a simple bar chart.\\n\\nIn this presentation, we'll look at Layer Cake, which is a graphics framework in Svelte built for these twin demands of a newsroom. Its approach is different from most frameworks or libraries you may have worked with and we'll look at how you can create reusable code to  produce engaging graphics in a fast-paced environment.\\n\\nThis session is good for people who have knowledge of JavaScript and D3 already and want to learn how to translate that to Svelte. Experience with Svelte is not required but will be helpful. We'll discuss the philosophy behind project code as much as possible and try not focus too much on the specific syntax.

Wish no more! You don't need to waste time making a chart in R and then remaking it with another tool for style reasons.  Here you'll learn how to customize *everything.*  We'll talk custom axes, color palettes, backgrounds, margins and more. We'll learn to use custom and proprietary fonts. Then we'll save it all as a theme that you can use with a single line of code!\\n\\nThis session is good for anyone who is familiar with R and ggplot2. Laptops will be provided.   \n",

       "144  Anti-transgender laws have surged across state legislatures in recent years. At least 83 anti-trans bills have passed in U.S. states in  2023 so far, and hundreds more have been proposed in Congress. Many outlets have reported on the existence of this legislation, but fewer news organizations have dug deeper into the root causes of anti-trans activism or where money and resources for anti-trans legislation come from. More, as these laws go into effect across the U.S., there will be important stories about the consequences of their enforcement and the experiences of transgender people as their rights are chipped away. \\n\\nCome with questions about how to find better reporting questions, frame stronger stories, and cut through politics to get to facts. Get practical tips on finding and reporting stories that cover anti-trans legislation's consequences accurately and responsibly. Panelists will talk through examples of how previous investigative stories were developed and how editorial framing decisions were made. \\n\\nThe first half of the session will be a brief panel discussion. The second half of the session will be a larger group discussion for all attendees. NICAR attendees are encouraged to bring story ideas to this session and workshop them with TJA members.\\n\\nThis session has been planned in collaboration with the Trans Journalists Association.

We’ll learn about various tools and functions in Excel that come in handy when you need to re-structure or otherwise get your data ready for analysis. We'll cover string functions, logical functions, date functions, reshaping data, merging data using lookup functions and perhaps a few other nifty tricks if time allows. We’ll do some “drills” introducing you to these concepts, then put your new skills to work in a sort of “scrimmage,” fixing up some real-life data. You’ll also walk out with practice data and a 30-page tipsheet that covers, in detail, everything from the class, plus more that we won’t have time for.\\n\\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. \\n\\nWorkshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use pivot tables.   \n",

Attendees will learn how to efficiently identify and send required elements to the CAPTCHA-solving service and apply the unique codes received to navigate past CAPTCHAs encountered during web scraping. Special focus will be placed on tackling Google's reCAPTCHA v2, a commonly used CAPTCHA on the web, alongside strategies for overcoming challenges presented by more complex websites. The class will provide practical skills in CAPTCHA solving, equipping attendees with the knowledge to implement these solutions in their own projects.\\n\\nThis session is good for individuals who have a foundational understanding of web scraping techniques with tools such as Requests, Playwright and Selenium. The concepts taught apply to most languages, but this class is taught using Python and a bit of JavaScript. Laptops will be provided.   \n",
