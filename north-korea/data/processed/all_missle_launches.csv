The first was in 1998 and the second was in 2009 (North Korea attempted a launch over Japan in 2006 but the rocket failed before overflying Japan). Initial reports suggested that North Korea launched 3 missiles, this was later deterimined to be innaccurate and that North Korea had only launched a single missile. The exact type of missile launched is unclear however we have can narrow it down. Based on the range alone it would have to be either the Hwasong-12 or the Hwasong-14 because those are the only known missiles in North Korea's arsenal capable of travelling that distance. The consensus is that this was a launch of the HS-12. The estimated maximum range of this missile is 4500 km making the 2700 km distance travelled puzzeling. The reduced range was likely either the result of some failure with the missile or North Korea purposely testing the missile at a reduced range (both of which are not without precedence).This is unclear. Early reports out of Japan reported that the missile broke apart into multiple pieces suggesting a failure. In addition, the missile travelled only 2700 km, significantly shorter than its estimated range. North Korea later reported the test as a success and released photographs of the test and Kim Jong Un observing it. Maps placed in front of Kim suggest the missile may have been intended to travel farther than it did. A subsequent test on September 14 followed a similar trajectory except this time the missile travelled about 1000 km farther.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/29/91/0401000000AEN20170829000755315F.html; http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/29/0401000000AEN20170829000752315.html; http://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/north-koreas-missile-test-over-japan; https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902300202039738368; https://twitter.com/jseldin/status/902291268369305600; https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902604666646777861; https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korean-missile-flies-over-japan-escalating-tensions-and-prompting-an-angry-response-from-tokyo/2017/08/28/e1975804-8c37-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_nkoreamissile-546pm:homepage/story&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffere55ca&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_term=.024311fb0d4a; http://www.mod.go.jp/e/press/release/2017/08/29a.html; https://www.facebook.com/36WGPA/posts/1772782709430433;,2017,8,Monday,Intermediate-range

The missile was launched on a lofted trajectory. Initial analysis suggests if launched on a trajectory to maximize its range then it could cover approximately 10,000 km. Such a missile brings most of the continental United States within range. The test was highly anticipated as well. There were multiple reports from US intelligence agencies that said North Korea was preparing for a missile launch sometime during the last week of July. However, most of those reports cited activity at Kusong, around where the first ICBM test was carried out. This test occurred over 100 km away from that location. Some have speculated that this test was North Korea's attempt to demonstrate that it could ""fake out"" US intelligence and carry out a launch without the US knowing where it would come from. Subsequent reports from South Korea and the US stated that the respective intelligence agencies were aware of and tracking the activity and were not fooled. The launch location itself appears to be a missile base or TEL maintenance facility close to the Chinese border.",https://twitter.com/DaveSchmerler/status/891208500071636992; http://www.mod.go.jp/e/press/release/2017/07/29b.pdf; http://www.mod.go.jp/e/press/release/2017/07/29a.pdf; http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/28/540008218/north-korea-h-ballistic-missile-seoul-and-the-pentagon-say?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/28/north-korea-fires-missile-japan-reports-say; https://www.inverse.com/article/34804-north-korea-missile-test-night-launch?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=on_site&utm_campaign=article-footer; http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-idUSKBN1AD1ZB?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social; http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-29/north-korea-missile-test-proves-the-us-is-well-within-range/8756472; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40760583#; http://www.npr.org/2017/07/28/540088346/north-korea-successfully-launches-second-icbm; https://www.buzzfeed.com/nancyyoussef/north-korea-missile-could-have-reached-us-midwest-estimates?utm_term=.fb2ZwnBNO#.kdybV9OYZ; https://www.ft.com/content/e4e723f8-73ce-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c; https://twitter.com/CurtisMelvin/status/892013648658477056,2017,7,Friday,Intercontinental

However, if North Korea had fired it intending to maximize distance estimates suggest it could have travelled approximately 7,000 km.

Due to some confusing reports, it was initially referred to as the KN-17. Information has since surfaced that the KN-17 is actually the designation for the Hwasong-12. This missile's name is still slightly unclear. North Korea refers to this as the ""ultra precision"" missile. The missile itself appears to be a Scud-C with a Manueverable Re-entry Vehicle, hence the designation ""Scud-C MaRV"".  This test marked another first for North Korea in 2017. It was the first successful test of the Scud-C MaRV, a missile with a maneuverable terminal stage.  A maneuverable terminal stage is significant because such a system could potentially frustrate missile defense systems like THAAD. This missile was first sighted at the April 15, 2017 parade. This missile was initially believed to have been tested 3 times in April and failed repeatedly. Information has since surfaced that these were actually tests of the Hwasong-12. While this test is reported to have occurred at Wonson Kalma International Airport, the test actually took place right outside the airport, about 100 meters on the northern side.

Even the type and number of missiles tested is unclear. Given that a number of Pakistania and Iranian observers are believed to have been present for the test, it appears one purpose of this test was to attract foreign buyers and interest in North Korea's missiles. It is unclear which missile among these tests was the Nodong. It may have been the first of the 4, the last, or any of the ones in the middle. The tests began late on May 29 and continued overnight and into the following day as well.

The 1984 tests probably took place over the course of several months rather than on the same days as they are entered here. What we know though is that North Korea carried out at least 6 tests. We also know that the tests were caried out at Tonghae. We also know that 3 of the tests succeeded and that at least 3 failed. We do not know exactly which ones were failures and which ones were successes. We also do not know exactly when these tests took place except that it was between April and September of 1984. Readers should interpret the information about these first tests as our best estimates as to what occured in a secret program within one of the most secret regimes in the world. Information on tests after 1993 is much more complete than information on the early years of this program.
